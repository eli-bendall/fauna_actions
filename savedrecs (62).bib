Abstract = {{American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was a dominant species in eastern
   North America prior to the importation of chestnut blight. In light of
   recent efforts to restore viable populations of chestnut in eastern
   forests, an increased understanding of its association with other
   co-occurring, disturbance-adapted oak species is necessary. We evaluated
   crown architecture and leaf morphology in juvenile chestnut and red oak
   (Quercus rubra) to assess potential differences in establishment
   strategies of both species. We also investigated differences in
   nonstructural carbohydrate reserves and whole tree biomass partitioning
   between species. Seedlings of both species were planted in forest stands
   treated either with midstory removal or small patch cuts, simulating
   potential restoration plantings. After 5-7years, chestnut's allocation
   to its root system was lower than red oak's, with chestnut saplings
   instead diverting resources to branches and foliage. Chestnut had lower
   leaf area index, greater crown projection area, and higher specific leaf
   area than red oak, indicating the species may have an advantage in
   shaded understories. There were only minor differences in nonstructural
   root carbohydrate reserves, between red oak and American chestnut,
   indicating that chestnut may respond similarly to oak by resprouting
   after disturbances topkill young saplings. We suggest that American
   chestnut has morphological and physiological attributes that allow it to
   function as an opportunistic and plastic species that can utilize gaps
   to facilitate its canopy recruitment, yet still persist after occasional
   surface fire. This knowledge can guide restoration strategies for this
   iconic species of the eastern temperate forest region.}},

Abstract = {{The federally endangered hemiparasite, Schwalbea americana L., American
   chaffseed (Scrophulariaceae), is a long-lived perennial herb adapted to
   fire-maintained ecosystems, such as Pinus palustris Mill. - Aristida
   spp. (longleaf pine-wiregrass) communities of the southeastern Coastal
   Plain. Schwalbea americana exhibits fire-induced flowering, and
   populations reportedly decline in the absence of fire; however,
   long-term population response to alternative management options, along
   with recovery potential following short-term fire exclusion, is unclear.
   The purpose of this study was to determine the population status and
   recovery of S. americana following short-term population declines
   associated with prior experimental management techniques. Specifically,
   we examined density of individuals and new recruits in 2001, and
   survivorship of individuals between 1992-2001, in four natural
   populations that were subjected to experimental management techniques
   between the years 1992-1996. Treatments included dormant season burn
   (March), growing season burn (June), growing season mowing (June), and
   control (no treatment). Our findings indicate that none of the
   short-term experimental management techniques have a detrimental effect
   on population persistence (five years post-treatment), and the
   population fluctuations that we observed may be related more to
   precipitation patterns than to residual effects of experimental
   treatments. Additionally, S. americana exhibits periods of prolonged
   winter dormancy that may facilitate long-term population persistence
   during unfavorable environmental conditions or fire suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Headland Zieria (Zieria prostrata) is an endangered species restricted

   species also occurs within the endangered ecological community Themeda
   grassland on sea cliffs and coastal headlands in the New South Wales

   encroachment of native species is perceived as a threatening process
   within these grasslands, and also to the unique species within them,
   such as Headland Zieria. Suggested management actions for the community
   and Headland Zieria include the removal of other shrubs by frequent fire
   or mechanical means. We conducted a survey and correlative analyses to
   test the validity of these proposed actions. We provide evidence that
   Headland Zieria is facilitated by a higher density of nearby shrubs
   which may provide protection from the elements and decrease competition
   from other understorey species but is eventually out competed by them
   when the grassland fully transitions to a Banksia shrubland. We suggest
   that Headland Zieria is an ecotonal specialist that may require an
   invasion front of shrubs and/or isolated patches. The implementation of
   fire and/or overstorey shrub removal may be detrimental where

Abstract = {{Prescirbed fire is a common land management tool used to reduce

   examined whether a prescribed fire would affect the abundance of lizards

   treated with low-intensity prescribed fires: four adjacent non-burned
   sites served as controls. Vegetation structure (litter depth. percent
   canopy cover. visual obstruction) and foliar cover were recorded prior
   to and seasonally following the burn. Lizards and potential invertebrate
   prey were collected from all plots between March and August 2004 (152
   traps. 5908 trap nights), Lizard numbers Were not significantly (P >

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma are the largest remaining tracts
   of tallgrass prairie in North America. This area has undergone major
   changes in land management practices in the past 30 years. Traditional
   season-long cattle stocking with variable burn schedules has diversified
   to include intensive-early cattle stocking accompanied by annual
   burning. To understand how different land management practices affect
   the herpetofauna of a tallgrass prairie, we used mark-recapture
   statistics to analyze herpetofaunal community dynamics. We analyzed
   survey data collected over a 15-year time span (1989-2003) from a
   rangeland site in Cowley County, KS, USA. A modified Jolly-Seber open
   population model, POPAN-5, was used to estimate four community
   parameters: probability of species loss (phi'), probability of detection
   (p), probability of entry (P-ent), and species richness (N). The top
   models included burn status as a covariate for species loss rate, while
   cattle stocking received moderate support as a covariate. Rates of
   species loss were higher during burn years (phi'=0.04, 95\% Cl: 0.02 to
   0.08) than nonburn years (phi'=0.00, 95\% Cl: 0.00 to 0.01). Analysis of
   the impacts of different management practices was difficult due to
   confounding effects of changes in both burning and grazing. Declines in
   species richness tended to be steepest during a period of season-long
   stocking, but results were not statistically significant. Though our
   limited data set does not allow us to draw strong conclusions on the
   effects of land management on herpetofaunal populations, the
   markrecapture models illustrated in our study should prove to be a
   valuable tool in future analyses of similar data.}},

Abstract = {{Trophic downgrading is a major concern for conservation scientists. The
   largest consumers in many ecosystems have become either rare or
   extirpated, leading to worry over the loss of their ecosystem function.
   However, trophic downgrading is not a uniquely modern phenomenon. The
   extinction of 34 genera of megafauna from North America approximate to
   13 000 yr ago must have led to widespread changes in terrestrial
   ecosystem function. Studies that have examined the event address impacts
   on vegetative structure, small mammal communities, nutrient cycling, and
   fire regimes. Relatively little attention has been paid to community
   changes at the top of the food chain. Here, we examine the response of
   carnivores in North America to the Pleistocene extinction. We employ
   fossil data to model the climatic niche of endemic canids, including the
   extinct dire wolf Canis dirus, over the last 20 000 yr. Quantifying the
   abiotic niche allows us to account for expected changes due to climate
   fluctuations over the Late Quaternary; deviations from expected
   responses likely reveal influences of competition and/or resource
   availability. We quantify the degree of niche conservatism and
   interspecific overlap to assess species and community responses among
   canids. We also include in our analyses a novel introduced predator, the
   domestic dog Canis lupus familiaris, which accompanied humans into the
   New World. We find that endemic canid species display low fidelity to
   their climatic niche through time, We find that survivors increasingly
   partition their climatic niche throughout the Holocene and,
   surprisingly, do not expand into niche space presumably vacated by the
   extinction of very large carnivores. These results suggest that loss of
   megaherbivores and competition with humans likely outweighed advantages
   conferred from the loss of very large predators. We also find that
   wolves and dogs decrease their niche overlap throughout the Holocene,
   suggesting a distinctive relationship between dogs and man.}},

Volume = {{78}},

Pages = {{15-27}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Logging has recently been used as a restoration tool in Florida scrub, a
   pyrogenic shrubland ecosystem that often develops a pine canopy in the
   absence of fire. We studied the effects of logging and fire, alone and
   in combination, on fire-suppressed Florida scrub on the Lake Wales Ridge
   in south-central Florida. Restoration goals were both structural (reduce
   pine canopy, hardwood subcanopy, shrub stem density; increase bare sand)
   and compositional (increase rare plant occupancy and forb diversity). In
   2- and 5-yr posttreatment surveys, all treatments significantly reduced
   pine density and the hardwood subcanopy relative to the control, but no
   treatment was successful in reducing shrub stem densities. Burning alone
   exposed sandy substrate for forb recruitment, but the logging treatments
   created significantly larger areas of bare sand. Treatments had little
   effect on species richness and rare species abundance, but two rare
   species recruited into logged plots. The weak treatment effects on forbs
   likely reflect the long period of fire suppression, a pattern seen in
   other studies. All treatments, especially logging, increased graminoid
   occupancy; although the log-and-burn treatment initially increased forb
   occupancy, the effect was short-lived. The most significant effects of
   logging were large-scale soil disturbance and increased graminoid
   abundance. Overall, both Ere and logging achieved most short-term (2-4
   yr) management goals. However, the large-scale soil disturbance caused
   by logging may facilitate invasion of exotics and ruderals and limit the
   effectiveness of prescribed burning. We conclude that fire continues to
   be the best practice for restoration of Florida scrub.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{947-958}},
Abstract = {{Fire has varying effects on species ecology. Knowledge of amphibian
   responses to fire is particularly limited, with variable responses
   reported amongst studies. Variability is attributed to differences in
   fire regimes, sampling methodologies, historical exposure to fire and
   species traits. Acid frogs, a group of amphibians restricted to acidic
   coastal heath wetlands of eastern Australia, occupy a discrete
   ecological niche that is exposed to regular and intense fires. Visual
   encounter surveys conducted monthly over 2 years revealed different
   short- and long-term responses to fire in three threatened acid frog
   species (Litoria olongburensis, Litoria freycineti and Crinia tinnula).
   Fires altered the thermal properties of habitats by increasing substrate
   temperature and widening daily temperature ranges. Acid frog populations
   did not suffer adversely from moderate intensity fires as suitable
   refuges, including standing water, were available. All species were
   present shortly after fire with subsequent successful reproduction
   occurring once wetlands were sufficiently inundated. Time since fire was
   a strong predictor of landscape scale differences in average relative
   abundance of acid frogs, yet the relationships varied among species.
   This highlights the importance of assessing community-wide responses to
   fire at the landscape scale. The dynamic and adaptive responses observed
   within acid frog populations demonstrate substantial resilience to fire
   processes in these fire prone environments.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem management implies a concern over time periods of tens to
   hundreds of years for sites on a scale of tens to hundreds of hectares.
   Decision makers need to be able to model the likely consequences of
   alternative management strategies at these temporal and spatial scales.
   They therefore require models that can be constructed quickly and
   cheaply, that capture the key components of the ecosystem, that respond
   plausibly to management actions, and are easy to explain, modify and
   understand. This paper presents the frame-based modeling paradigm as a
   response to these needs. Frame-based modeling is used to examine the
   effects of soil, weather, fire and deer population density on management
   of the white pine ecosystem in northern Minnesota.
   The management objective is to maintain white pine forest. The paper
   describes how current understanding of seedling establishment, tree
   growth, competition, herbivory and the effects of fire and high winds,
   can be captured at a consistent level of resolution in a model that can
   be presented, completely, in a few pages of text. The paper goes on to
   describe how the model was tested at three sires in northern Minnesota,
   and was then used to explore alternative management strategies.
   Our results confirm that it is comparatively easy to maintain a forest
   in early successional stages by burning or clear-cutting, and in late
   stages by suppression of fires and control of cutting. Establishment and
   maintenance of mid-successional stages, such as red and white pine, is
   much more difficult and requires a finely-tuned balance between natural
   disturbance and management action. For example, the pine forest was only
   maintained on average for 117 years out of 1000 years (average among
   1000 simulated stands) on poor soil with high fire frequency and high
   deer density. When the deer population was low, when all wild fi es were
   suppressed, and when prescribed ground fires were used to promote pine
   establishment, years in pine was 804 out of 1000 years. The model
   provides guidance for management decisions to maintain the desired
   conditions.
   The paper draws some conclusions from this particular modeling exercise
   that are likely to be generally applicable. For example, the modeling
   exercise illustrates limits to what management can hope to achieve, the
   importance of maintaining strategies over long time periods, and the
   difficulties of predicting and measuring success when the time horizon
   is hundreds of years. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Patch-burning is frequently advocated as a management tool to enhance
   the biodiversity and pasture values of spinifex (Triodia) grasslands. In
   this study we compare the capture rates of small mammals in habitats
   regenerating shortly after fire (aged 1-5 years) and in long-unburnt
   habitats (aged >25 years). To unravel the effects of temporally and
   spatially variable rainfall on capture rates, the study was replicated
   at three locations spaced over 50 km apart that experience different
   rainfall regimes. Ten species of small mammals were captured over the
   course of the study, between October 1999 and June 2001. Pseudomys
   desertor showed a strong preference for long-unburnt habitats. Notomys
   alexis, Sminthopsis youngsoni and Sminthopsis hirtipes showed some
   preferences for regenerating habitats, but these were not consistent
   throughout the study. Factors indicative of temporal and spatial
   variation in rainfall, time and site had important effects on capture
   rates. High rainfalls associated with the La Nina phase of the El
   Nino/Southern Oscillation in 2000 increased seed production and prompted
   eruptions of rodent species and the carnivorous Dasycercus cristicauda.
   The greatest numbers of captures were made at the sites that received
   the highest rainfalls. We conclude that patch-burning regimes do not
   benefit small mammals directly, but are likely to increase the
   resilience of `fire-sensitive' species that are dependent on dense
   spinifex by reducing the extent of wildfires.}},

   restricted to Gove Peninsula of north-eastern Arnhem Land, a remote area
   of northern Australia. The subspecies has been listed as an Endangered
   taxon under federal and Northern Territory legislation, and represents
   one of only a few cases in the Australian Region in which a tropical
   butterfly has been targeted for species-orientated conservation.
   However, accurate status evaluation and conservation management have
   been hampered by lack of detailed information on spatial distribution,
   critical habitat, and the extent and severity of threatening processes.
   Surveys carried out during 2006-2008 indicate that the subspecies has a
   limited geographical range (extent of occurrence approximately 6,700
   km(2)) within which it is recorded from 11 locations or subpopulations
   embracing a total of 21 sites. Most sites comprise discrete habitat
   patches that are relatively small in area (< 10 ha) within which adults
   are localised and occur in low abundance (< 15 h(-1)). Of the four major
   habitat types in which E. alcathoe enastri was detected, only mixed
   paperbark tall open forest with rainforest elements in the understorey
   and rainforest edge (i.e. the ecotone between evergreen monsoon
   vine-forest and eucalypt/paperbark woodland) comprise breeding habitats.
   These habitat patches were always associated with permanent creeks or
   perennial groundwater seepages or springs that form swamplands, usually
   along drainage lines or flood plains in coastal or near coastal lowland
   areas. Major threats identified at the site level are habitat
   modification through altered fire regime and habitat disturbance by
   feral animals (buffalo, pig); potential threats at the landscape level
   include habitat loss through invasive species (grassy weeds, tramp ants)
   and global climate change. However, since critical breeding areas are
   subject to natural disturbance by both fire and flood, and occasionally
   cyclonic events, an optimal balance in disturbance regime is probably
   required to sustain breeding populations. Although E. alcathoe enastri
   is a narrow-range endemic that is ecologically specialised, there is no
   evidence of decline. Accordingly, the conservation status of the
   subspecies should be regarded as Near Threatened ('Conservation
   Dependent') under IUCN criteria. Components for an effective long-term
   conservation management plan of the butterfly and its habitat, which
   largely depend on the cooperation of traditional landowners and
   involvement of local indigenous ranger groups, are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive and over-abundant predators pose a major threat to biodiversity
   and often benefit from human activities. Effective management requires
   understanding predator use of human-modified habitats ( including
   resource subsidies and disturbed environments), and individual variation
   within populations. We investigated selection for human-modified
   habitats by invasive red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, within two predominantly
   forested Australian landscapes. We predicted that foxes would select for
   human-modified habitats in their range locations and fine-scale
   movements, but that selection would vary between individuals. We
   GPS-tracked 19 foxes for 17-166 days; ranges covered 33 to >2500 ha.
   Approximately half the foxes selected for human-modified habitats at the
   range scale, with some `commuting' more than five kilometres to farmland
   or townships at night. Two foxes used burnt forest intensively after a
   prescribed fire. In their fine-scale nocturnal movements, most foxes
   selected for human-modified habitats such as reservoirs, forest edges
   and roads, but there was considerable individual variation. Native fauna
   in fragmented and disturbed habitats are likely to be exposed to high
   rates of fox predation, and anthropogenic food resources may subsidise
   fox populations within the forest interior. Coordinating fox control
   across land-tenures, targeting specific landscape features, and limiting
   fox access to anthropogenic resources will be important for biodiversity
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Nonnative species are a threat to biodiversity as their numbers are
   increasing in protected areas globally, impacting many ecological
   processes such as hydrological cycles, fire regimes, and competition.
   These species possess traits that ease their progression into alpine
   habitats, which could be a threat to rare and endemic plants in these
   areas. A prime example of this is in the Gaspesie National Park (Quebec)
   where many nonnative species, such as Poa annua, are progressing in
   elevation, establishing in alpine habitats inhabited by rare and endemic
   species. In the case of this study, the impacts of elevation on parental
   plants and date of collection on seed germinability was determined for
   mature seeds of P. annua on three mountains in the Gaspesie National
   Park. Elevation as well as the date of collection did not influence
   germination of seeds of P. annua, and total germination remained very
   high (>80\%) at high elevations. Therefore, because seed germination is
   not affected by maternal plant elevation, we assume that the abundance
   of P. annua may increase in disturbed alpine areas, and management
   strategies should be developed to counter or mitigate the effects of
   these invasions.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Manipulation of forest habitat via mechanical thinning or prescribed
   fire has become increasingly common across western North America.
   Nevertheless, empirical research on effects of those activities on
   wildlife is limited, although prescribed fire in particular often is
   assumed to benefit large herbivores. We evaluated effects of season and
   spatial scale on response of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) and
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to experimental habitat manipulation at
   the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range in northeastern Oregon, USA.
   From 2001 to 2003, 26 densely stocked stands of true fir (Abies spp.)
   and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were thinned and burned whereas
   27 similar stands were left untreated to serve as experimental controls.
   We used location data for elk and mule deer collected during spring (1
   Apr-14 Jun) and summer (15 Jun-31 Aug) of 1999-2006 to compare use of
   treated and untreated stands and to model effects of environmental
   covariates on use of treated stands. In spring, elk selected burned
   stands and avoided control stands within the study area (second-order
   selection; large scale). Within home ranges (third-order selection;
   small scale), however, elk did not exhibit selection. In addition,
   selection of treatment stands by elk in spring was not strongly related
   to environmental covariates. Conversely, in summer elk selected control
   stands and either avoided or used burned stands proportional to their
   availability at the large scale; patterns of space use within home
   ranges were similar to those observed in spring. Use of treatment stands
   by elk in summer was related to topography, proximity to roads, stand
   size and shape, and presence of cattle, and a model of stand use
   explained 50\% of variation in selection ratios. Patterns of stand use
   by mule deer did not change following habitat manipulation, and mule
   deer avoided or used all stand types proportional to their availability
   across seasons and scales. In systems similar to Starkey, manipulating
   forest habitat with prescribed fire might be of greater benefit to elk
   than mule deer where these species are sympatric, and thus maintaining a
   mixture of burned and unburned (late successional) habitat might provide
   better long-term foraging opportunities for both species than would
   burning a large proportion of a landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation development in dry heathlands was studied during a six-year
   period following experimental burning, sod-cutting and cutting in a
   continental area in the southern part of the Czech Republic (Podyji
   National Park). Calluna vulgaris-dominated heathlands in the area were
   composed of uneven-aged stands and had been unmanaged for several
   decades. The aim of the study was testing the applicability of Western
   European management systems to nature conservation in a continental
   area. Species composition was recorded in 8 permanent plots using 25 x
   25 cm grids, and vegetation recovery following different treatments was
   analysed. Calluna recovered successfully after burning. Burning dense
   heathlands, which contained a large amount of woody fuel, resulted in a
   medium-intensity fire that destroyed moss mats and litter and exposed
   patches of bare ground to facilitate Calluna regeneration by seed, in
   addition to vegetative regrowth. On the contrary, in open heathlands
   with patches of herbaceous vegetation, low-intensity fires which failed
   to expose mineral soil were more typical. Almost all Calluna
   regeneration was vegetative in this case, and regrowth was slower.
   Heathland recovery after sod-cutting to mineral soil depended on whether
   or not Calluna seed germination occurred in the plot. With germination,
   the community developed towards heathland; without towards grassland.
   Cutting promoted a striking increase in grass cover, which was followed
   by the slow recovery of Calluna. The experiments suggest that of these
   management systems, burning is perhaps the most appropriate in the study
   area. A nature conservation management system is proposed, based on
   sheep grazing combined with rotational burning of restricted patches.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of senesced leaves is a strong driver for litter

   effects of global change factors and ecosystem management strategies on
   nutrients and stoichiometry of mature leaves have been well established.
   In contrast, we still know little about their effects on the quality of
   senesced leaves, which would be different from that of mature leaves due
   to the occurrence of nutrient resorption during leaf senescence. We
   examined the effects of nitrogen (N) addition (5.25g N m(-2) yr(-1)),
   prescribed fire (with four frequencies, including no burning and burning
   every 1, 2, 4 years), and their interactions on N and phosphorus (P)
   concentrations and N:P ratios in senesced leaves of five dominant
   species in a temperate steppe of northern China. Nutrient concentrations
   and N:P ratios of senesced leaves varied substantially among the five
   species. Nitrogen addition increased N concentrations and N:P ratios but
   had no significant effect on P concentrations. Fire significantly
   increased N and P concentrations and N:P ratios in senesced leaves
   across all species. The effects of fire depended on its frequency. There
   was no interaction between N addition and fire in affecting nutrient
   concentrations and stoichiometry of senesced leaves. Our results
   suggested that N addition and fire can potentially alter litter quality

Abstract = {{Forest wildfires can dramatically affect soil communities and reduce
   abundance and diversity of soil fauna. The recovery of soil animals
   after a fire depends both on immigration from the unburnt forest and on
   local survival in less-burnt spots, but the relative importance of these
   mechanisms is poorly known. Therefore, these factors were studied with
   regard to soil macrofauna and soil mites seven years after a wildfire
   occurring in a pine forest area with shallow soil in 2001 in central
   Sweden. Three replicate transects, each consisting of four plots were
   studied. The plots were located in (i) the unburnt forest close to the
   fire edge; (ii) slightly burnt patches directly attached to the unburnt
   forest; (iii) slightly burnt patches surrounded by bare rock but
   connected to the unburnt forest edge by a corridor with mostly unburnt
   litter and vegetation; and (iv) island patches not connected with a
   corridor to the unburnt forest edge. The hypothesis was that that soil
   animals would particularly disperse from the unburnt forest to
   moderately burnt plots inside a burnt area via the network of less-burnt
   corridors. Poor dispersers would be especially few in the island patches
   lacking connection to the ``mainland{''}, whereas good dispersers would
   be independent of gaps in connectivity. As expected, the highest
   abundance of both macrofauna and oribatid mites was found in the unburnt
   forest. Resident soil macro- and mesofauna representatives had half the
   abundance in the edge and corridor plots as compared to the control, but
   their abundance was not lower in the island plots than in the corridor
   plots indicating on-site survival and recovery. Mobile mesostigmatid
   mites did not show any significant reduction of abundance in any of the
   plots. The abundance of soil-dwelling oribatid mites did not differ
   between islands and unburnt forest, but mobile aboveground oribatids had
   significantly lower abundance on the islands than in the unburnt forest.
   The opposite was observed for aboveground and belowground oribatid mite
   species richness. In conclusion, belowground animals showed mainly local
   survival and seemed to be independent of corridors presence, whereas
   most aboveground and mobile macro- and mesofauna seemed to be more
   responsive to isolation induced by forest fires. Soil and litter
   corridors connecting unburnt patches inside the burnt forests with the
   unburnt edges were important mainly for less mobile groups of soil
   macrofauna. This supports the idea that there is a relatively slow
   process of soil ecosystem recovery and that external colonization of the
   burnt areas dominates over the local survival and recovery from refuges.

Title = {{Forest restoration as a double-edged sword: the conflict between
   biodiversity conservation and pest control}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Forestry has markedly changed a large proportion of the world's
   boreal forests, often with negative effects on biodiversity. As a
   result, forest restoration is increasingly implemented to counteract the
   negative effects. However, restoration measures aimed at mimicking
   natural disturbance regimes could simultaneously increase the risk of
   unwanted negative effects, such as damage by forest pest species. This
   study compares the effect of two restoration methods (prescribed burning
   and gap-cutting), on both biodiversity conservation and pest control, to
   provide a basis for solutions to this potential conflict.
   2. Bark beetles are ideal for studying this conflict, as this group is
   both species-rich and contains notorious pest species. We conducted a
   unique, large-scale field experiment in which we compared the effect of
   two different restoration methods on the abundance, species richness and
   assemblage composition of bark beetles. In addition, we estimated
   uncontrolled tree mortality by the number of trees that died
   post-restoration.
   3. Beetles were divided in two groups, primary and secondary, the former
   with an ability to kill growing trees. Bark beetle diversity did not
   differ between treatment groups prior to restoration. However, after
   restoration, assemblage composition and primary bark beetle abundance
   differed between the treatments. Furthermore, species richness was
   higher in burned and gap-cut stands compared to reference stands.
   4. The number of trees that died post-restoration was highest on burned
   sites, whereas no difference was found between gap-cut and reference
   stands. The number of dead trees was correlated with the number of
   primary beetles.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the potential for a
   conflict between forest restoration for biodiversity conservation and
   the potential risk for tree mortality caused by forest pests. This is
   likely to become a problem in many boreal forests; however, our results
   suggest that this conflict can be moderated by the choice of restoration
   method. The restoration method gap-cutting had a similar positive impact
   on bark beetle species richness as compared to the burning method, but
   did not as burning, increase tree mortality. Thus, in areas where there
   is an apparent risk for pest outbreaks, our data suggest that
   gap-cutting should be the chosen method to avoid an unwanted increase in
   tree mortality at the stand level.}},

Abstract = {{The effects on birds of forest insects, tree diseases, wildfire, and
   management strategies designed to improve forest health (e.g., thinning,
   prescribed burns, road removal, and spraying with pesticides or
   biological microbial agents) are discussed. Those bird species of
   concern that occur in forested habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington
   include the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcon
   (Falco peregrinus), harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), upland
   sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis),
   ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), and black rosy finch (Leucosticte
   arctoa). In addition, seven species of woodpeckers and nuthatches were
   considered because of their rare status. Forest disturbances that create
   dead trees and logs are critical to cavity-nesting birds because the
   dead trees with their subsequent decay provide nesting and roosting
   habitat. The insects associated with outbreaks or dead trees provide
   prey for the woodpeckers and nuthatches. The loss of nest or roost trees
   as a result of disturbance could be detrimental to bald eagles,
   goshawks, or ferruginous hawks, while the loss of canopy cover could be
   detrimental to harlequin ducks and goshawks or to prey of some of the
   raptors. The more open canopies created by thinning may be beneficial to
   a species like the black rosy finch, yet detrimental to some woodpeckers
   due to a decrease in cover. Prescribed burning may be beneficial to
   those woodpeckers primarily associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) stands and detrimental to other woodpeckers because of the
   loss of coarse woody debris. Removal of roads is likely to benefit most
   of these species because of the subsequent decrease in human activity.
   Recovery plans for bald eagles and peregrine falcons are available for
   managers to use in managing habitat for these species.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation values of `old-growth' forests in landscapes subject to
   repeated disturbance by fire or logging have received considerable
   conservation attention. However, little is known of the conservation
   values of old-growth sites in ecosystems with an evolutionary history of
   highly frequent disturbance. Here we address the value of low fire
   frequency (<1 fire/10 years) in tropical savannas, the world's most
   fire-prone biome, in terms of ant biodiversity. We do this by comparing
   savanna ant communities within the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near
   Darwin in the Australian monsoonal tropics, which has experienced a low
   incidence of fire over 25 years due to active fire exclusion, with those
   of adjacent (outside) sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of
   burning every 2-5 years. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and
   arboreal pitfall traps at 16 sites, eight each inside and outside TWP.
   More than 16 000 ants were recorded during the study, representing a
   total of 98 ant species from 30 genera. More species in total were
   recorded outside (90) than inside (74) TWP, but there was no difference
   in mean site species richness or abundance, and overall species
   composition was similar. All species recorded inside TWP are common and
   widespread throughout the savanna landscapes of the broader region, in
   the absence of active fire exclusion. Low fire frequency at the
   Territory Wildlife Park therefore does not appear to have enhanced
   regional ant conservation values. Our findings reinforce the importance
   of targeting fire regimes that are clearly linked to positive
   conservation outcomes, rather than assuming a need for maximum
   `pyrodiversity'.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary pressures on sagebrush steppe from climate change, exotic
   species, wildfire, and land use change threaten rangeland species such
   as the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). To effectively
   manage sagebrush steppe landscapes for long-term goals, managers need
   information about the potential impacts of climate change, disturbances,
   and management activities. We integrated information from a dynamic
   global vegetation model, a sage-grouse habitat climate envelope model,
   and a state-and-transition simulation model to project broad-scale
   vegetation dynamics and potential sage-grouse habitat across 23.5
   million acres in southeastern Oregon. We evaluated four climate
   scenarios, including continuing current climate and three scenarios of
   global climate change, and three management scenarios, including no
   management, current management and a sage-grouse habitat restoration
   scenario. All climate change scenarios projected expansion of moist
   shrub steppe and contraction of dry shrub steppe, but climate scenarios
   varied widely in the projected extent of xeric shrub steppe, where hot,
   dry summer conditions are unfavorable for sage-grouse. Wildfire
   increased by 26\% over the century under current climate due to exotic
   grass encroachment, and by two-to four-fold across all climate change
   scenarios as extreme fire years became more frequent. Exotic grasses
   rapidly expanded in all scenarios as large areas of the landscape
   initially in semi-degraded condition converted to exotic-dominated
   systems. Due to the combination of exotic grass invasion, juniper
   encroachment, and climatic unsuitability for sage-grouse, projected
   sage-grouse habitat declined in the first several decades, but increased
   in area under the three climate change scenarios later in the century,
   as moist shrub steppe increased and rangeland condition improved.
   Management activities in the model were generally unsuccessful in
   controlling exotic grass invasion but were effective in slowing woodland
   expansion. Current levels of restoration treatments were insufficient to
   prevent some juniper expansion, but increased treatment rates under the
   restoration scenario maintained juniper near initial levels in priority
   treatment areas. Our simulations indicate that climate change may have
   both positive and negative implications for maintaining sage-grouse
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{We characterized recent historical and current vegetation composition
   and structure of a representative sample of subwatersheds on all
   ownerships within the interior Columbia River basin and portions of the
   Klamath and Great Basins. For each selected subwatershed, we constructed
   historical and current vegetation maps from 1932 to 1966 and 1981 to
   1993 aerial photos, respectively. Using the raw vegetation attributes,
   we classified and attributed cover types, structural classes, and
   potential vegetation types to individual patches within subwatersheds.
   We characterized change in vegetation spatial patterns using a suite of
   class and landscape metrics, and a spatial pattern analysis program. We
   then translated change in vegetation patterns to change in patterns of
   vulnerability to wildfires, smoke production, and 21 major forest
   pathogen and insect disturbances. Results of change analyses were
   reported for province-scale ecological reporting units (ERUs). Here, we
   highlight significant findings and discuss management implications.
   Twentieth century management activities significantly altered spatial
   patterns of physiognomies, cover types and structural conditions, and
   vulnerabilities to fire, insect, and pathogen disturbances. Forest land
   cover expanded in several ERUs, and woodland area expanded in most. Of
   all physiognomic conditions, shrubland area declined most due to
   cropland expansion, conversion to semi- and non-native herblands, and
   expansion of forests and woodlands. Shifts from early to late seral
   conifer species were evident in forests of most ERUs; patch sizes of
   forest cover types are now smaller, and current land cover is more
   fragmented. Landscape area in old multistory, old single story, and
   stand initiation forest structures declined with compensating increases
   in area and connectivity of dense, multilayered, intermediate forest
   structures. Patches with medium and large trees, regardless of their
   structural affiliation are currently less abundant on the landscape.
   Finally, basin forests are now dominated by shade-tolerant conifers, and
   exhibit elevated fuel loads and severe fire behavior attributes
   indicating expanded future roles of certain defoliators, bark beetles,
   root diseases, and stand replacement fires. Although well intentioned,
   20th-century management practices did not account for landscape-scale
   patterns of living and dead vegetation that enable forest ecosystems to
   maintain their structure and organization through time, or for the
   disturbances that create and maintain them. Improved understanding of
   change in vegetation spatial patterns, causative factors, and links with
   disturbance processes will assist managers and policymakers in making
   informed decisions about how to address important ecosystem health
   issues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{353-382}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mediterranean climate ecosystems are among the most fire-prone in the
   world; however, little is known about the effects of fire on
   mediterranean streams (med-streams). Fire impacts on med-streams are
   associated with increased runoff and erosion from severely burned
   landscapes during storms, particularly the first intense rains.
   Increased inputs of water, solutes, nutrients, sediment, organic matter,
   and ash to streams after fires are usually observed for months to up to
   4 years. Return to pre-fire conditions is associated with vegetation
   recovery. Benthic algae, invertebrates, and fish are reduced to low
   levels by scouring floods after wildfire. If riparian zones are burned,
   benthic algae increase, and invertebrate communities become dominated by
   r-strategist species. Fishes are eradicated from reaches affected by
   intense wildfire and often do not re-colonize quickly because of
   downstream barriers. In general, med-stream communities appear to be
   more resilient to fire compared to streams in other ecosystems because
   of the rapid recovery of mediterranean upland and riparian vegetation
   and geomorphological conditions (1-4 years in med-streams vs 5-10 years
   in non-med streams). However, drought or mass sediment movements after
   fire can prolong fire effects. Studies of the long-term effects of fire
   and the consequences of fire management practices are still needed.}},

Abstract = {{In Italy, pre-Alpine forests, once managed through coppice silviculture,
   are being converted to mature woodland, while land abandonment is
   causing woodland expansion and erosion of open habitats. Based on
   habitat-selection analyses, we predicted the impact of such changes on
   common buzzards (Buteo buteo), which depend on forested and open areas
   for nesting and foraging. Compared to availability, at a micro-scale
   buzzards selected nests higher above ground and on trees frequently
   covered by ivy. At the landscape-scale, buzzards avoided roads and
   conspecifics, while selecting rugged areas with high habitat
   heterogeneity, probably related to a varied food supply. Productivity
   was related to the availability of and habitats, probably because of
   their richness in main prey species. Finally, population density was
   negatively related to the abundance of eagle owls (Bubo bubo), a
   potential predator of adults and nestlings, and positively related to
   the availability of woodland, a low predation-risk habitat rich in food
   and nest-sites. Therefore, buzzard settlement, density and productivity
   depended on the complex interplay of food availability, human
   persecution and predation risk. Thus, the current landscape changes
   would benefit buzzards by providing more nest-sites, but would be
   detrimental because of the lower productivity associated with the
   disappearance of dry open areas. Proposed conservation guidelines focus
   on conversion of coppice woodland to mature forests and active
   management of dry heath, a conservation sensitive habitat, through
   controlled burning.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of noxious weeds on rangeland and forests in the United

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{The reduction and simplification of grasslands has led to the decline of
   numerous species of grassland fauna, particularly grassland-obligate
   birds. Prairie-chickens (Tympanuchusspp.) are an example of obligate
   grassland birds that have declined throughout most of their distribution
   and are species of conservation concern. Pyric herbivory has been
   suggested as a land management strategy for enhancing prairie-chicken
   habitat and stabilizing declining population trends. We assessed
   differences in vegetation structure created by pyric herbivory compared
   to fire-only treatments to determine whether pyric herbivory increased
   habitat heterogeneity for prairie-chickens, spatially or temporally. Our
   study was performed at four sites in the southern Great Plains, all
   within the current or historic distribution of either lesser
   (T.pallidicinctus), greater (T.cupido), or Attwater's (T.cupido
   attwateri) prairie-chickens. Key vegetation characteristics of grass
   cover and vegetation height in pyric herbivory and fire-only treatments
   were within the recommended range of values for prairie-chickens during
   their distinct life history stages. However, patches managed via pyric
   herbivory provided approximately 5\% more forb cover than fire-only
   treatments for almost 30 months post-fire. Additionally, pyric herbivory
   extended the length of time bare ground was present after fires. Pyric
   herbivory also reduced vegetation height and biomass, with mean
   vegetation height in pyric herbivory treatments lagging behind fire-only
   treatments by approximately 15 months. Canopy cover in fire-only
   treatments exceeded levels recommended for prairie-chicken young within
   12 months post-fire. However, canopy cover in pyric herbivory treatments
   never exceeded the maximum recommended levels. Overall, it appears that
   pyric herbivory improves vegetation characteristics reported as critical
   to prairie-chicken reproduction. Based on our results, we suggest pyric
   herbivory as a viable management technique to promote prairie-chicken
   habitat in the southern Great Plains, while still accommodating
   livestock production.}},

Abstract = {{In the dry eucalypt forests of north-eastern New South Wales, Australia,
   cattle grazing occurs at low intensities and is accompanied by frequent

   responded to a range of environmental factors at the landscape, habitat
   and microhabitat scales. Forest type, spatial relationships and habitat
   variability at the site scale were more important in determining spider
   assemblages than localized low-intensity grazing and burning. However,
   it is possible that a threshold intensity of grazing may exist, above
   which spiders respond to grazing and burning. Although low-intensity
   grazing and burning may not affect spider assemblages below a threshold
   stocking rate, that stocking rate has yet to be established.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding patterns of species diversity at different spatial scales
   is important for adapting management and conservation efforts. We have
   therefore studied wild bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) diversity
   structure in forest landscapes and evaluated the importance of
   conservation management at the local and landscape levels. Surveys were
   conducted at 32 clearcuts in eight landscapes in a managed boreal forest
   region. We assessed the influence of local habitat and landscape
   composition on species richness patterns and the effect of prescribed
   burning and landscape affinity on species composition for all bees and
   wasps as well as ecological and functional groups. The relative
   contribution of alpha and beta diversity on the regional level was
   assessed by diversity partitioning and the beta diversity between
   landscapes further partitioned into components of species turnover and
   nestedness. Bee and wasp species richness increased with high flower
   richness and clearcut size, and species composition differed between
   burned and unburned sites. Thus, flower-rich early-successional sites in
   boreal forest landscapes are important habitats for wild bees and wasps.
   To support this fauna, openness should be maintained for extended
   periods by delaying or avoiding tree plantation at flower-rich spots on
   clearcuts. Beta diversity between landscapes accounted for the greatest
   proportion of the total regional gamma diversity, and over 70\% of this
   diversity was due to species turnover. This implies that in order to
   maintain regional diversity, conservation efforts should be spatially
   dispersed, i.e. applied to every landscape of a few hundred square
   kilometers and adapted to the local species assemblages. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{For millennia, natural disturbance regimes, including anthropogenic fire
   and hunting practices, have led to forest regeneration patterns that
   created a diversity of forest lands across the USA. But dramatic changes
   in climates, invasive species, and human population, and land use have
   created novel disturbance regimes that are causing challenges to
   securing desired natural regeneration. Climate is an ever-present
   background disturbance and determinant of species distribution. Changes
   in certain other factors such as large herbivore populations, wildfire,
   and pests modify forest composition and structure, and are common
   barriers to natural regeneration of desired species. Changes in
   long-standing disturbance regimes have led to the homogenization of
   forest landscape composition and structure. Today, forests have low
   regeneration potential and are low in resilience. They have reduced
   productivity and are prone to widespread health issues including severe
   forest mortality. In addition to epidemics of native invasive species
   due to climate change and availability of habitat at landscape scales,
   the continued introduction and spread of non-native pests and diseases
   are causing large-scale forest mortality. These ecological changes have
   cascading ecological consequences such as increases in severe wildfire,
   which pose new barriers to natural regeneration. Equally challenging are
   the barriers to natural regeneration that arise from social, political
   and economic factors. To address many of these issues requires active
   management that links all critical stages in the regeneration niche

Abstract = {{Forest management practices that mimic natural canopy disturbances,
   including prescribed fire and timber harvests, may reduce competition
   and facilitate establishment of favorable vegetative species within
   various ecosystems. Fire suppression in the central Appalachian region
   for almost a century has contributed to a transition from oak-dominated
   to more mesophytic, fire-intolerant forest communities. Prescribed fire
   coupled with timber removal is currently implemented to aid in oak
   regeneration and establishment but responses of woodland salamanders to
   this complex silvicultural system is poorly documented. The purpose of
   our research was to determine how woodland salamanders respond to
   shelter-wood harvests following successive burns in a central
   Appalachian mixed-oak forest. Woodland salamanders were surveyed using
   coverboard arrays in May, July, and August September 2011 and 2012.
   Surveys were conducted within fenced shelterwood-burn (prescribed fires,
   shelterwood harvest, and fencing to prevent white-tailed deer
   {[}Odocoileus virginianus] herbivory), shelterwood-burn (prescribed
   fires and shelterwood harvest), and control plots. Relative abundance
   was modeled in relation to habitat variables measured within treatments
   for mountain dusky salamanders (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), slimy
   salamanders (Plethodon glutinosus), and eastern red-backed salamanders
   (Plethodon cinereus). Mountain dusky salamander relative abundance was
   positively associated with canopy cover and there were significantly
   more individuals within controls than either shelterwood-burn or fenced
   shelterwood-burn treatments. Conversely, habitat variables associated
   with slimy salamanders and eastern red-backed salamanders did not differ
   among treatments. Salamander age-class structure within controls did not
   differ from shelterwood-burn or fenced shelterwood-burn treatments for
   any species. Overall, the woodland salamander assemblage remained
   relatively intact throughout the shelterwoodburn silvicultural treatment
   compared to previous research within the same study area that examined
   pre-harvest fire effects. However, because of the multi-faceted
   complexities of this specific silvicultural system, continued research
   is warranted that evaluates long-term, additive impacts on woodland
   salamanders within managed central Appalachian deciduous forests.

Abstract = {{From 2000 through 2003 we used semiochemical-baited traps in
   northeastern Minnesota, USA, to assess changes in assemblages of
   subcortical forest insects after a catastrophic wind storm in 1999 and
   subsequent (1999-2000) fuel-reduction activities (salvage-logging and
   prescribed-burning). We determined the regional efficacy of fifteen
   semiochemical blends (pheromones and kairomones) as attractants for
   target and non-target subcortical insect species (Coleoptera:
   Anthribidae, Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Cleridae, Cucujidae,
   Curculionidae, Histeridae, Nemonychidae, Salpingidae, Scolytidae,
   Tenebrionidae, and Hymenoptera: Siricidae). During the four summers, we
   trapped 86,471 subcortical insects (143 species) in baited and unbaited
   Lindgren funnel traps, and 500 beetles (44 species) in baited and
   unbaited pitfall traps. We report 23 new state collection records of
   subcortical insects from Minnesota. Trap catches of subcortical insects
   were greatest in the wind-disturbed areas 2 years after the event, and
   declined thereafter. Similar trends were observed for subcortical
   insects in the burned areas. Both wind-disturbance and burning increased
   the subcortical insect species richness and diversity on the landscape.
   The subcortical insect species compositions of the salvaged and burned
   forest areas differed from those of the undisturbed and wind-disturbed
   areas. Trap catches of subcortical insects in response to semiochemical
   treatments also varied with year of sampling and land-area treatment.
   The greatest diversity of subcortical beetle species was in traps baited
   with attractants for the scolytids, Dendroctonus valens
   {[}(+)-alpha-pinene and (-)-beta-pinene] and Dryocoetes spp.
   {[}exo-brevicomin and (-)-alpha-pinene], perhaps reflecting the generic
   nature of the baits. The most distinct species compositions were
   collected in response to the woodborer and Dendroctonus simplex baits,
   whereas the species compositions in traps with the D. valens and
   Dryocoetes spp. baits, and the unbaited funnel trap were the most
   similar. The variation in trap catch with time and across landscapes
   suggests that the responses of subcortical insects to semiochemicals are
   more complex than previously appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{Although private properties are predicted to play an increasingly
   significant role in conservation, surveys of species of special concern
   are rare on these lands. We created a template for a multi-county survey

   land use was strongly correlated with tortoise population condition. The
   highest densities of tortoise burrows were found on lands with
   open-canopied pine stands that were managed with prescribed fire, a
   practice associated with types of selection forestry and/or wildlife
   management. Agricultural sites and unburned areas provided poor habitat
   and pine plantations were only slightly better. Our estimates of
   tortoise population densities indicated that the current landscape
   supports less than 20\% of the animals present before implementation of
   modern land use practices. In addition, our estimate for density of

Abstract = {{Cockatoo grass {[}Alloteropsis semialata (R.Br.) A. Hitchc.] is
   considered a keystone species in northern Australian ecosystems as it
   provides a food resource for many species, including several endangered
   vertebrates. This study examined both local and regional environmental
   factors influencing cockatoo grass distribution and abundance in the Wet
   Tropics of north Queensland, Australia. Local distribution and abundance
   were investigated in the sclerophyll ecotone between open woodland and
   tall open forest, because little is known about cockatoo grass
   distribution within this habitat; also, the endangered northern bettong
   (Bettongia tropica) is restricted to this habitat and depends on
   cockatoo grass for its survival. Regional-scale modelling of
   distribution was undertaken to examine the climatic tolerances of
   cockatoo grass in Queensland. Density of cockatoo grass was negatively
   related to litter cover, soil moisture, and the presence of two dominant
   grass species, Themeda triandra {[}Forssk.(R.Br.) Stapf] and
   Cleistochloa subjuncea (C. E. Hubb.). Soil nutrients (N, C, S, and C : N
   ratio) were positively related to density of cockatoo grass. A late dry
   season experimental burn demonstrated that cockatoo grass had high
   survival to fire, with increased density and flowering in response to
   fire. Regional-scale modelling using climate variables indicated that
   cockatoo grass is more suited to the drier end of the sclerophyll
   habitat range. Cockatoo grass in the woodland-forest ecotone in the Wet
   Tropics appears to be influenced by several environmental features
   associated with the ground layer. The species benefits from the
   reduction in litter cover and competing grass species that result from
   management actions such as prescribed burning. Understanding of the
   factors limiting this species, both at a local and regional scale, can
   be used to guide management of this ecotone habitat for both cockatoo
   grass and the survival of other species that depend on it.}},

Abstract = {{Ash flows and flooding associated with wildfires represent important but
   understudied sources of disturbance for fish populations. Knowledge
   concerning these disturbances is especially limited for larger streams
   where warm water species dominate. Fire-related disturbances have been
   hypothesised to differentially affect native and non-native fishes,
   although this hypothesis has only been tested for salmonids. The
   objective of our research was to contrast effects of
   uncharacteristically large wildfires followed by flooding on
   metapopulations of native and non-native fishes in the Gila River of
   southwest New Mexico. Probabilities of occupancy, colonisation and local
   extinction of fishes were calculated across sites before and during
   disturbance and were also measured across a broader spatial scale during
   disturbance to identify potential refuge locations. Occupancy was higher
   for native fishes than non-natives, but multiple wildfire and flood
   events increased extinction probabilities of native species. Responses
   of non-native species to wildfires were mixed; extinction of non-native
   salmonids increased during disturbance, while extinction of several warm
   water species remained unchanged or decreased. Several undisturbed sites
   were poor refugia for natives as they were impacted by non-native
   piscivores, dewatering, and fragmentation. However, despite exposure to
   multiple disturbances, sites located in large tributary and valley
   reaches were consistently occupied by native species, suggesting these
   habitats provided refugia. We suggest that management actions (forest
   thinning; prescribed burning) that restore a more natural disturbance
   regime of small and less severe fires coupled with habitat remediation
   activities (non-native removal; decreased water withdrawal; improved
   connectivity) might diminish extinction risk for native fishes exposed
   to wildfire disturbance.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Increased incidence of landscape fire and pollinator declines with
   co-extinctions of dependent plant species are both globally significant.
   Fire can alter species distributions, but its effects on
   plant-pollinator interactions are poorly understood so its present and
   future role in coupled plant-pollinator declines cannot be assessed. We
   develop a conceptual model of fire effects on plant-pollinator
   interactions. We review the empirical literature in the context of this
   model to identify important knowledge gaps regarding the processes
   underlying these effects and the phenotypic traits of flowering plants
   and pollinators mediating these effects. Fire generates, and
   plant-pollinator interactions respond to, heterogeneity at multiple
   spatial scales. There is evidence of local-scale fire effects on these
   interactions, but landscape-scale effects are poorly understood. Nest
   location and floral resource utilization primarily mediate pollinator
   survival during and after fire. Voltinism and mobility traits are
   potentially important, but poorly studied. Plant traits mediating
   flowering responses to fire include growth form, phenology and
   potentially bud location, seasonal changes in bud exposure and response
   to bud damage.Synthesis and applications. We suggest management actions
   and an agenda for future research to fill knowledge gaps currently
   inhibiting predictions of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions.
   Fire regimes promoting floral diversity at local scales provide a
   surrogate means of managing pollinators and pollination while empirical
   research continues. Above-ground nesting, univoltine pollinators may be
   particularly vulnerable under expected fire regime changes. Improved
   knowledge of traits mediating the exploitation of landscape
   heterogeneity could be used to enhance the persistence of these species.
   Ultimately, our conceptual framework could be used as a basis for
   understanding fire effects on aggregate network properties to inform
   fire management strategies buffering plant-pollinator networks against
   secondary species extinctions.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, wildfires are considered the most commonly occurring
   disasters, resulting from natural and anthropogenic ignition sources.
   Wildfires consist of burning standing biomass at erratic degrees of
   intensity, severity, and frequency. Consequently, wildfires generate
   large amounts of smoke and other toxic pollutants that have devastating
   impacts on ambient air quality and human health. There is, therefore, a
   need for a comprehensive study that characterizes land atmosphere
   interactions with regard to wildfires, critical for understanding the
   interrelated and multidimensional impacts of wildfires. Current studies
   have a limited scope and a narrow focus, usually only focusing on one
   aspect of wildfire impacts, such as air quality without simultaneously
   considering the impacts on land surface changes and vice versa. In this
   study, we use several multisource data to determine the spatial
   distribution, frequency, disturbance characteristics of and variability
   and distribution of pollutants emitted by wildfires. The specific
   objectives were to (1) study the sources of wildfires and the period
   they are prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa over a 9 year period, i.e.,
   2007-2016, (2) estimate the seasonal disturbance of wildfires on various
   vegetation types, (3) determine the spatial distribution of black carbon
   (BC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke, and (4) determine the vertical
   height distribution of smoke. The results show largest burned areas in
   December January February (DJF), June July August (JJA) and September
   October November (SON) seasons, and reciprocal high emissions of BC, CO,
   and smoke, as observed by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research
   and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and
   Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). In addition, the
   results reveal an increasing trend in the magnitude of BC, and CO
   concentration driven by meteorological conditions such as low
   precipitation, low relative humidity, and low latent heat flux. Overall,
   this study demonstrates the value of multisource remotely sensed data in
   characterising long-term wildfire patterns and associated emissions. The
   results in this study are critical for informing better regional fire
   management and air quality control strategies to preserve endangered
   species and habitats, promote sustainable land management, and reduce

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{It is well understood that landscape processes can affect habitat
   selection patterns, movements, and species persistence. These selection
   patterns may be altered or even eliminated as a result of changes in
   disturbance regimes and a concomitant management focus on uniform,
   moderate disturbance across landscapes. To assess how restored landscape
   heterogeneity influences habitat selection patterns, we examined 21
   years (1991, 19932012) of Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido)
   lek location data in tallgrass prairie with restored fire and grazing
   processes. Our study took place at The Nature Conservancy's Tallgrass
   Prairie Preserve located at the southern extent of Flint Hills in
   northeastern Oklahoma. We specifically addressed stability of lek
   locations in the context of the fire-grazing interaction, and the
   environmental factors influencing lek locations. We found that lek
   locations were dynamic in a landscape with interacting fire and grazing.
   While previous conservation efforts have treated leks as stable with
   high site fidelity in static landscapes, a majority of lek locations in
   our study (i.e., 65\%) moved by nearly one kilometer on an annual basis
   in this dynamic setting. Lek sites were in elevated areas with low tree
   cover and low road density. Additionally, lek site selection was
   influenced by an interaction of fire and patch edge, indicating that in
   recently burned patches, leks were located near patch edges. These
   results suggest that dynamic and interactive processes such as fire and
   grazing that restore heterogeneity to grasslands do influence habitat
   selection patterns in prairie grouse, a phenomenon that is likely to
   apply throughout the Greater Prairie-Chicken's distribution when dynamic
   processes are restored. As conservation moves toward restoring dynamic
   historic disturbance patterns, it will be important that siting and
   planning of anthropogenic structures (e.g., wind energy, oil and gas)
   and management plans not view lek locations as static points, but rather
   as sites that shift around the landscape in response to shifting
   vegetation structure. Acknowledging shifting lek locations in these
   landscapes will help ensure conservation efforts are successful by
   targeting the appropriate areas for protection and management.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of recent extinctions and declines of Australian
   mammals is poor, particularly where there is a paucity of data to
   quantify change. The swamp antechinus (A. m. maritimus) has a
   fragmented, coastal distribution in south-east Australia. Although
   long-term studies (1975-2007) of this vulnerable species were conducted
   in the eastern Otways, its current status was unclear. We assessed the
   success of live trapping and camera trapping (2013-17) at 42 sites, 19
   where the species was trapped previously. Between 2013 and 2015 A. m.
   maritimus was recorded at only 6 sites (n = 8), but at none in 2016-17.
   Assessment of long-term changes found that high-density populations
   occurred after above-average rainfall, and both low-and high-density
   populations collapsed after wildfire, after low rainfall, and in
   fragmented habitat. The species may now be restricted to very small
   populations in refuges such as coastal dunes, and predicted low rainfall
   and increased burning frequency pose major threats to the species'
   survival. Recovery is unlikely without targeted management, including
   predator control and protection from inappropriate fire regimes and
   habitat fragmentation. If similar declines have been experienced across
   the species' range, prevention of extinction of the species will require
   similar management strategies.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Altered fire regimes can drive major and enduring compositional shifts
   or losses of forest ecosystems. In western North America, ponderosa pine
   and dry mixed-conifer forest types appear increasingly vulnerable to
   uncharacteristically extensive, high-severity wildfire. However,
   unburned or only lightly impacted forest stands that persist within burn
   mosaics-termed fire refugia-may serve as tree seed sources and promote
   landscape recovery. We sampled tree regeneration along gradients of fire
   refugia proximity and density at 686 sites within the perimeters of 12
   large wildfires that occurred between 2000 and 2005 in the interior
   western United States. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models
   to elucidate statistical relationships between tree regeneration and
   refugia pattern, including a new metric that incorporates patch
   proximity and proportional abundance. These relationships were then used
   to develop a spatially explicit landscape simulation model. We found
   that regeneration by ponderosa pine and obligate-seeding mixed-conifer
   tree species assemblages was strongly and positively predicted by
   refugia proximity and density. Simulation models revealed that for any
   given proportion of the landscape occupied by refugia, small patches
   produced greater landscape recovery than large patches. These results
   highlight the disproportionate importance of small, isolated islands of
   surviving trees, which may not be detectable with coarse-scale satellite
   imagery. Findings also illustrate the interplay between patch-scale
   resistance and landscape-scale resilience: Disturbance-resistant
   settings (fire refugia) can entrain resilience (forest regeneration)
   across the burn matrix. Implications and applications for land managers
   and conservation practitioners include strategies for the promotion and
   maintenance of fire refugia as components of resilient forest
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Military training areas (MTAs) cover 6\% of the earth's land surface,
   but the impact on biodiversity of weapons use in MTAs remains largely
   unknown. We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates
   in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia
   by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24
   sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set
   of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was
   similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual
   species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted
   sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and
   migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird
   species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that
   displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time
   across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and
   non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of
   recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through
   mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes.
   Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained
   considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence,
   MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to
   conservation outside the formal protected area network. However,
   managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental
   objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the
   aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of
   particular species. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Knowledge about species' responses to habitat restoration can inform
   subsequent management and reintroduction planning. We used repeated
   call-response surveys to study brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla)
   patch occupancy at the current limits of its apparently expanding range
   in an area with active habitat restoration. We fit a probit occupancy
   model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation using restricted
   spatial regression. Nuthatch occupancy was related to patch-level
   vegetation structure and range-extension context, i.e., latitude, but
   not prescribed fire history. Latitude and percent tree stocking had a
   negative relationship with occupancy (coefficients and 95\% credible
   intervals: -1.07 {[}CI: -1.63, -0.67] and -0.63 {[}CI: -0.97, -0.350]).
   The density of recently killed and well-decayed snags had positive
   associations with occupancy (coefficients and 95\% credible intervals:
   0.57 {[}CI: 0.17, 1.16] and 0.37 {[}CI: 0.05, 0.72]). Neither grassy
   herbaceous cover nor percent of stocking in pine were associated with
   occupancy. We found that restoration efforts created suitable stand
   structure for brown-headed nuthatches, but many restored sites in the
   range-extension zone appeared to be vacant. Occupied habitats in the
   range-extension zone had fewer snags, less frequent fire, and more shrub
   cover than occupied sites where the species was established. Release
   from conspecific competition may have permitted nuthatches in the
   range-extension zone to exploit habitats that would otherwise have been
   marginal. Alternatively, nuthatches may be restricted to such sites
   although there are more suitable sites tens of kilometers away.
   Experimental translocations and reintroductions could determine how
   habitat structure and nuthatch density affect the quality of restored
   sites in the range-extension zone and enable those sites to achieve
   their biodiversity potential. Published 2015. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {{Two conceptual models describe the successional and structural
   development of mature and transitional stands toward old-growth
   Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco forests in the Pacific Northwest.
   The ``catastrophic/maturational{''} model is based on infrequent
   catastrophic disturbances that initiate the successional cycle, while
   the ``chronic/ partial fire{''} model is based on low- to
   moderate-severity fires which, over long periods of. time, can create
   old-growth conditions through multiple disturbances. Although both
   models can produce similar structural characteristics, quantitative
   differences in speed and pathways of structural development with respect
   to these models are not well understood. To elucidate these quantitative
   differences, diameter distributions of live trees Were investigated in a
   chronosequence of mature, transitional, and old-growth stands subjected
   to these two disturbance models. Stands characterized by the
   ``catastrophic/maturational{''} model exhibited varying degrees of
   rotated sigmoid distributions up to 250-300 years of age because of long
   establishment periods and differential growth and mortality rates of the
   component species. They also showed a modest trend toward reverse-J
   distributions with increasing stand age. Stands characterized by the
   ``chronic/partial fire{''} model had a stratum of distinctly older
   emergent trees with younger cohorts of Pseudotsuga menziesti, Tsuga
   heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg., and Thuja plicata Donn. and exhibited
   reverse-J distributions within about 150-200 years after disturbance.
   These results suggest that reconsideration of current definitions of
   what constitutes old-growth on Tsuga sites may be necessary. A
   conceptual model is presented, which links pathways of structural
   development to disturbance regimes. This model indicates that active
   management can hasten the development of old-growth structure, even in
   some older forests.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is frequently used for land management purposes and may be crucial
   for effective control of invasive non-native plants. Nevertheless, fire
   modifies environments and may affect nontarget native biodiversity,
   which can cause conflicts for conservation managers. Native Australian
   reptiles avoid habitat invaded by the alien plant rubber vine
   (Cryptostegia grandiflora) and may be susceptible to the impacts of
   burning, a situation that provides a model system in which to examine
   possible conservation trade-offs between managing invasive plants and
   maintaining native biodiversity. We used replicated, experimental fire
   treatments (unburned, dry-season burned, and wet-season burned) in 2
   habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland) to examine the short-
   (within 12 months of fire) and longer-term (within 3 years of fire)
   changes of reptile assemblages in response to wet- and dry-season
   burning for weed management in tropical savannas of northern Australia.
   Within 12 months of fire, abundances of the skink Carlia munda
   (Scincidae) were higher in the burned sites, but overall reptile
   composition was structured by habitat type rather than by effects of
   burning. Within 3 years of a fire, the effects of fire were evident.
   Reptiles, especially the gecko Heteronotia binoei (Gekkonidae), were
   least abundant in dry-season burned sites; litter-associated species,
   including Carlia pectoralis (Scincidae), were rarely observed in burned
   habitat; and there were fewer species in the wet-season burned sites.
   Reptile abundance was associated with vegetation structure, which
   suggests that fire-induced changes detrimentally altered the
   availability of resources for some reptiles, particularly leaf-litter
   species. Invasive alien plants, such as rubber vine, have severe effects
   on native biodiversity, and control of such species is a fundamental
   land management objective. Nevertheless, fire management of invasive
   alien plants may adversely affect native biodiversity, creating a
   conservation conundrum. In such scenarios, land managers will need to
   identify the most desired conservation goal and consider the
   consequences for native biota.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive management is an iterative process of gathering new knowledge
   regarding a system's behavior and monitoring the ecological consequences
   of management actions to improve management decisions. Although the
   concept originated in the 1970s, it is rarely actively incorporated into
   ecological restoration. Bayesian networks (BNs) are emerging as
   efficient ecological decision-support tools well suited to adaptive
   management, but examples of their application in this capacity are few.
   We developed a BN within an adaptive-management framework that focuses
   on managing the effects of feral grazing and prescribed burning regimes
   on avian diversity within woodlands of subtropical eastern Australia. We
   constructed the BN with baseline data to predict bird abundance as a
   function of habitat structure, grazing pressure, and prescribed burning.
   Results of sensitivity analyses suggested that grazing pressure
   increased the abundance of aggressive honeyeaters, which in turn had a
   strong negative effect on small passerines. Management interventions to
   reduce pressure of feral grazing and prescribed burning were then
   conducted, after which we collected a second set of field data to test
   the response of small passerines to these measures. We used these data,
   which incorporated ecological changes that may have resulted from the
   management interventions, to validate and update the BN. The network
   predictions of small passerine abundance under the new habitat and
   management conditions were very accurate. The updated BN concluded the
   first iteration of adaptive management and will be used in planning the
   next round of management interventions. The unique belief-updating
   feature of BNs provides land managers with the flexibility to predict
   outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of management interventions.}},

Abstract = {{We studied Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) diets and the
   relative abundance and habitat associations of major prey species in a
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) forest in
   north-central Arizona, USA, from 1990 to 1993. The owl's diet was
   comprised of 94\% mammals by biomass and consisted of primarily the deer
   mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), brush mouse (P boylii), Mexican woodrat
   (Neotoma mexicana), and Mexican vole (Microtus mexicanus). Spotted owl
   prey in our study area were smaller on average than prey in other
   locations, and the total biomass of potential prey was less than that
   reported in other areas within the owl's geographic range. Although all
   prey populations exhibited seasonal fluctuations in relative abundance,
   only the deer mouse exhibited significant temporal variation in
   population abundance. The general pattern was for prey populations to
   rise during spring, peak during summer, decline in fall, and reach a
   winter low. Deer mice exhibited the greatest amplitude in population
   change as evidenced by the shift from a high of 12.2 mice/ha (SE = 2.3)
   during summer 1991 to a low of 3.3 mice/ha (SE = 0.7) during winter
   1991-1992. Woodrats and brush mice used areas on slopes > 20 degrees
   with relatively more rocks and shrub cover than found in other areas. In
   contrast, deer mice were found in forests with relatively open
   understories and little Gambel oak. Conservation measures for the
   Mexican spotted owl must include management directed at sustaining or
   increasing prey numbers rather than assuming that managing for owl
   nesting and roosting habitat will provide favorable conditions for the
   prey as well. Management practices that increase and sustain shrub and
   herbaceous vegetation should receive the highest priority. This can be
   accomplished by thinning small diameter trees, using prescribed fire,

Abstract = {{The Black Hills of Wyoming and South Dakota are characterized by a
   complex history of both natural and human disturbance regimes.
   Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were
   characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression
   and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered
   the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been
   harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands.
   The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas
   that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving
   minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly
   observed bird species, 3 species {[}red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta
   Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus
   aurocapillus)] were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in
   untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated
   stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird
   species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated
   stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire
   bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to
   have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been
   altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community
   will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine
   forest to one dominated by ground foraging species.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of fire on wetland vegetation in the mid-Atlantic region of

   the effects of fire within six tidal marsh wetlands at Blackwater

   stem density, litter, and changes in live biomass and stem density of
   four dominant wetland plant species (11 variables). Our results suggest

Abstract = {{Conservation and restoration ecology efforts may conserve or restore a

   common methods of conserving and restoring tallgrass prairie have a weak
   scientific rationale, are not consistent with plausible history, and
   threaten prairie biodiversity.  Dormant-season burns and grazer
   exclusion are human interventions that may promote artificially
   consistent dominance of large grasses utilizing the C4 photosynthetic
   pathway, thereby relegating hundreds of other prairie plants to small
   populations that are vulnerable to local extinction.  I recommend an
   experimental approach to large remnant conservation and restoration in
   which varied conditions alter dominance, thereby increasing short-term
   species richness.  I also recommend prescribed burning during the
   summer, to simulate the timing of lightning fire, and light-to-moderate
   grazing by different ungulates, to simulate historical grazing history. 
   Both should favor plants that are consistently infrequent or rare in
   many managed prairies.  Varied regimes of burn season, burn interval,

   Kansas that is managed for ecological research. We surveyed the site
   during mid-Mar to mid-May, 1981-2008, and recorded detections of birds
   in a grid of 6.3?ha survey plots (n = 187 plots). We used multiseason
   occupancy models to estimate the probabilities of occupancy (psi) and
   detection (p), and tested whether land cover in woody vegetation, and
   land use with prescribed fire or grazing management influenced the
   dynamic processes of site colonization and local extinction. Probability
   of detection per site was consistently <1 and varied among years (p =
   0.120.82). Site occupancy of prairie-chickens declined 40\% over the
   study period from a high of psi=0.19 +/- 0.02 SE in 1981 to a low of
   0.11 +/- 0.03 in 2008, despite protection from disturbance at leks and
   losses to harvest. We found that different sets of environmental factors
   impacted the probabilities of colonization and local extinction.
   Probability of colonization for an unoccupied site was negatively
   associated with the proportion of site occupied by woodland cover
   (beta=-1.25), and was lower for grazed sites (beta=-0.62). In contrast,
   probability of local extinction was affected by a weak interaction
   between grazing and average frequency of prescribed fire (beta = -1.01),
   but model-averaged slope coefficients were not statistically different
   than 0. To conserve prairie-chickens, we recommend prairies be managed
   with combinations of prescribed fire and grazing that maintain a
   heterogeneous mosaic of prairie habitats, while preventing woody
   encroachment. To assess biotic responses to land management practices,
   field sampling should be based on occupancy models or similar techniques
   that account for imperfect detection. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity and natural ecosystems are under pressure from a large
   range of drivers. In south eastern Australia these include periods of
   drought and occasional floods, increasing urbanisation pressures,
   changing land use patterns, altered fire frequency and regime, habitat
   loss and degradation, impacts of invasive species, etc. Detailed and
   reliable information about the spatial distribution of species provides
   critical information for effective conservation planning. In Victoria,
   Australia, this responsibility is held by the Department of
   Sustainability and Environment, which maintains and curates a database
   of site records for species: the Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA).
   Although this database is comprehensive and contains many records for
   numerous species, the information is provided in point form. This point
   data can be useful for some planning and management tasks, but does not
   provide an adequate view of distribution for all management purposes. By
   integrating known occurrences of species with environmental GIS data
   layers using statistical or machine learning algorithms, it is possible
   to build models and to predict the likelihood that the species may occur
   at particular locations across large landscapes. We have used the VBA to
   build species distribution models (SDMs) for 523 vertebrate fauna
   species across the whole state, providing predictive `maps' that are
   available for use in various conservation planning activities. In this
   paper, we introduce and discuss the methods we developed and implemented
   for producing these models.
   Modelling requires a number of steps: gathering species occurrence data,
   vetting or mining this data for useful records and winnowing out
   potentially misleading records, collating existing and / or developing
   new relevant environmental variables, selecting an appropriate modelling
   algorithm, training and evaluating models, mapping predictions to the
   whole state scale, and selecting a threshold to transform the continuous
   model result into binary (i.e. presence/absence) mapped outputs.
   All the occurrence data for the 523 fauna species were derived from the
   VBA. This database contains presence data for fauna species, but for the
   majority of survey techniques information on absences cannot be known or
   inferred. Twenty four explanatory variables were selected for use in
   developing models including 12 bioclimatic, terrain and soil radiometric
   (BTSR) variables, two coordinates (latitude and longitude), and 10
   remotely sensed variables primarily derived from a time series of
   Landsat imagery. For each species, three versions of models (V1, V2 and
   V3 models) reflecting different constraint were built. V1 models used 12
   BTSR variables; V2 models used 12 BTSR variables and two coordinates;
   and V3 models used all the 24 variables.
   Since true absence data was not available, pseudo-absences were created
   by filtering random points by a profile model based on Mahalanobis
   distance method. Using both pseudo-absences and the true presences data
   SDMs were developed with a machine learning algorithm, random forest,
   which was implemented in the statistical computing environment R. The
   models were evaluated using six accuracy measures, which have been
   demonstrated suitable for evaluating presence-only models. These metrics
   include AUL (area under the lift curve), MVDl (the maximum vertical
   distance from lift curve to the diagonal line), MPA (minimal predicted
   area with pre-specified true positive rate), VDl (vertical distance from
   lift curve to the diagonal line), Lift and Se (sensitivity). These
   measures can be used for both within-species and among-species model
   comparisons. A threshold was set for each model with a method based on
   maximising the sum of sensitivity and specificity to provide binary
   outputs or maps of species' distributions.}},

Title = {{Low-severity fires increase susceptibility of lodgepole pine to mountain
   pine beetle outbreaks in Colorado}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{544-550}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Both fire and insect outbreaks are critical components of many forest
   ecosystems and understanding the two-way interactions between these
   disturbance types is an important goal for researchers, resource
   managers, and policy makers. Much recent research has focused on
   understanding the effects of outbreaks on subsequent fires, but the
   effects of fires on subsequent outbreaks are also important in shaping
   ecosystem dynamics.
   In the current study we examined how low-severity fires influence
   susceptibility of lodgepole pine to mountain pine beetle (MPB). We
   examined 607 lodgepole pine trees in stands that were affected by
   low-severity fire in 2002 and subsequent MPB outbreak in Routt National
   Forest, Colorado. For each tree we recorded effect by fire (no visible
   effect; visible effect - i.e. charring), recent effect by MPB (no
   visible effect; infestation - i.e. presence of MPB entry or exit holes;
   or mortality), dbh, and age (based on increment core samples).
   Tree diameter (dbh) was the most important factor in determining
   susceptibility to MPB such that larger trees were more susceptible to
   MPB. But once dbh was taken into account, trees that were charred were
   more likely to have been attacked and killed by MPB. Previous work has
   found that stand-replacing fires reduce susceptibility of lodgepole pine
   stands to MPB in these ecosystems. The current results high-light the
   fact that fires that are below a high threshold of severity and instead
   injure or otherwise weaken trees, may increase susceptibility to MPB.
   Fire-affected lodgepole may act as vectors for the spread of out-breaks
   during moderate outbreak conditions or as refuges during endemic
   population phases. It is important to consider how low-severity fires,
   including prescribed burns, may increase forest susceptibility to
   outbreaks at local to landscape scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Evidence, Perceptions, and Trade-offs Associated with Invasive Alien
   Plant Control in the Table Mountain National Park, South Africa}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The Table Mountain National Park is a 265 km(2) protected area embedded
   within a city of 3.5 million people. The park contains an extremely
   diverse flora with many endemic species, and has been granted World
   Heritage Site status in recognition of this unique biodiversity.
   Invasive alien plants are arguably the most significant threat to the
   conservation of this biodiversity, and the past decade has seen the
   implementation of aggressive programs aimed at the removal of invasions
   by these plants. These invasive alien plants include several species of
   trees, notably pines (Pinus species) and eucalypts (Eucalyptus species),
   which historically have been grown in plantations, and which are
   utilized for recreation by the city's residents. In addition, many
   citizens regard the trees as attractive and ecologically beneficial, and
   for these reasons the alien plant control programs have been
   controversial. I briefly outline the legal obligations to deal with
   invasive alien plants, the history of control operations and the
   scientific rationale for their implementation, and the concerns that
   have been raised about the operations. Evidence in support of control
   includes the aggressive invasive nature of many species, and the fact
   that they displace native biodiversity (often irreversibly) and have
   negative impacts on hydrology, fire intensity, and soil stability. Those
   against control cite aesthetic concerns, the value of pine plantations
   for recreation, the (perceived) unattractive nature of the treeless
   natural vegetation, and the (incorrect) belief that trees bring
   additional rainfall. The debate has been conducted through the press,
   and examples of perceptions and official responses are given. Despite
   opposition, the policy promoting alien plant removal has remained in
   place, and considerable progress has been made towards clearing pine
   plantations and invasive populations. This conservation success story
   owes much to political support, arising largely from job creation, and a
   strong body of scientific evidence that could be cited in support of the
   program.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{Our ability to prevent extinction in declining populations often depends
   on effective management of habitats that are disturbed through wildfire,
   logging, agriculture, or development. In these disturbed landscapes, the
   juxtaposition of multiple habitat types can be especially important to
   fledglings and young birds, which may leave breeding grounds in
   human-altered habitat for different habitats nearby that provide
   increased foraging opportunities, reduced competition, and higher
   protection from predators. In this study, we evaluated the importance of
   three habitat types to two life stages of the critically endangered
   Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi), a synanthropic songbird endemic to
   Andros, The Bahamas. First, we determined the avian species composition
   and relative abundance of I. northropi among three major vegetation
   types on Andros: Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea) forest, coppice
   (broadleaf dry forest), and anthropogenic areas, dominated by nonnative
   vegetation (farmland and developed land). We then compared the foraging
   strategies and social interactions of two age classes of adult Bahama
   Orioles in relation to differential habitat use. Bird surveys late in
   the Bahama Oriole's breeding season indicated the number of avian
   species and Bahama Oriole density were highest in coppice. Some bird
   species occurring in the coppice and pine forest were never observed in
   agricultural or residential areas, and may be at risk if human
   disturbance of pine forest and coppice increases, as is occurring at a
   rapid pace on Andros. During the breeding season, second-year (SY) adult
   Bahama Orioles foraged in all vegetation types, whereas
   after-second-year (ASY) adults were observed foraging only in
   anthropogenic areas, where the species nested largely in introduced
   coconut palms (Cocos nucifera). Additionally, SY adults foraging in
   anthropogenic areas were often observed with an ASY adult, suggesting
   divergent habitat use for younger, unpaired birds. Other aspects of
   foraging (vegetation features, food-gleaning behavior, and food items)
   were similar for the two age classes. Older Bahama Orioles exhibited
   relatively higher rates of social interactions (intraspecific and
   interspecific pooled) in anthropogenic areas, and won more interaction
   outcomes compared to younger adults. Our findings concur with those of
   other studies indicating dry broadleaf forest is vitally important to
   migrating, wintering, and resident birds, including the critically
   endangered Bahama Oriole, which appears to depend heavily on this
   vegetation type during certain life stages.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of early successional and open habitats often requires
   active removal of encroaching vegetation. In many cases, fire or other
   historically applied methods can no longer maintain or create open or
   early-successional habitat. In these situations, managers must employ
   mechanical or chemical treatments to control vegetation and improve
   habitat quality for wildlife that depend on open habitats. We conducted
   a large-scale study of tree removal from 2005 to 2011 on 14 grassland
   sites in central North America. Beginning in the autumn of 2005, shrubs,
   scattered trees, shelterbelts and woodlots were removed from six of
   fourteen study sites with cutting and burning treatments. Trees and
   shrubs accounted for 7-21\% of pre-treatment ground cover. We conducted
   vegetation and bird surveys on each site for oneyear before and sixyears
   after initiating tree removal treatments. Treatments effectively removed
   larger woody vegetation (>6m in height), but effects of shrub removal
   were less consistent due to rapid regrowth. Tree removal sites also
   experienced reductions in grassy litter as a result of prescribed fires
   that were used to discourage shrub and tree regrowth. On untreated
   sites, abundance of all grassland birds declined throughout the study,
   on average declining by 62\%. On tree removal sites, we estimated that
   grassland bird abundance dropped from 204 (birds per count) before
   treatment to a low of 090 in the second year after initiating
   treatments, but recovered in the final threeyears of study with a weak,
   but significant positive response sixyears after initiating treatment,
   with an estimated 142 birds per count. Waterfowl and wetland birds
   increased following tree removal, whereas woodland birds, particularly
   those that nest in cavities, declined on treated sites.Synthesis and
   applications. Tree removal did appear to improve habitat suitability for
   grassland birds, but a positive response was weak and delayed, and
   treatments caused short-term habitat disturbances that significantly
   reduced abundance of target species. When planning large-scale tree
   removal, it may be beneficial to allow undisturbed habitat in the
   surrounding landscape to ameliorate potential short-term displacement of
   wildlife in early phases of treatment. In addition, managers should
   expect site recovery to require repeated treatments over multiple years.}},

   composition of carabid beetles over a 22-year chronosequence of time
   since last fire in a coastal heathland in western Norway. We show that
   burning increases alpha species richness, and is particularly important
   for the richness of typical open habitat species. Our results also show
   that there are clear compositional differences between assemblages along
   the chronosequence, supporting the value for landscape scale
   biodiversity of rotational burning. Species richness is also increased
   by a higher species turnover between consecutive years in patches that
   have been burnt recently as compared to patches that have not been burnt

Abstract = {{The temperate island of Tasmania is a global centre of plant endemism,
   with relictual lineages that persist in topographically rugged, wet and
   cool refugia. An iconic example of these palaeoendemic plants is the
   slow-growing conifer, Athrotaxis cupressoides D. Don (Cupressaceae). The
   geographic range of A. cupressoides has shrunk since European settlement
   because of destructive anthropogenic fires. Inscription of the Tasmanian
   Wilderness World Heritage Area in 1982 provided formal protection for
   Tasmania's palaeoendemic taxa, but they remain vulnerable to
   lightning-ignited landscape fires, which are becoming more frequent due
   to climate change. We surveyed stands across the species' range and
   found that stands damaged by fires in the 20th century had higher grass
   cover and were more exposed to hot northerly winds than unburnt stands.
   A recruitment bottleneck was evident, with juveniles absent in 28\% of
   unburnt and 47\% of burnt transects. Transects on small islands in lakes
   had lower herbivore densities and less evidence of fire than comparable
   mainland transects. However, the island transects had lower densities of
   A. cupressoides seedlings and saplings, despite similar densities of
   adult trees, suggesting factors other than fire and herbivory contribute
   to the poor regeneration. We also studied the effects of a lightning
   fire in 2016, finding it killed 68\% of stems overall, with stems less
   than 30 cm diameter and those scarred by previous fires more likely to
   die. These findings of high adult mortality and poor regeneration
   following fire suggest that the geographic range of A. cupressoides will
   contract due to the increasing frequency of lightning-ignited fires.
   Management responses to the increasing risk of landscape fires now
   include establishment of seed banks, restoration planting and use of
   irrigation to protect stands from active fires, in addition to rapid
   suppression of ignitions and targeted planned burning to reduce fuel
   loads in surrounding flammable vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Soils are a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystems, and play
   key roles in biogeochemical cycles and the ecology of microbial, plant
   and animal communities. Global increases in the intensity and frequency
   of ecological disturbances are driving major changes in the structure
   and function of forest ecosystems, yet little is known about the
   long-term impacts of disturbance on soils. Here we show that natural
   disturbance (fire) and human disturbances (clearcut logging and
   post-fire salvage logging) can significantly alter the composition of
   forest soils for far longer than previously recognized. Using extensive
   sampling across a multi-century chronosequence in some of the tallest
   and most carbon-dense forests worldwide (southern Australian, mountain
   ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests), we provide compelling evidence that
   disturbance impacts on soils are evident up to least eight decades after
   disturbance, and potentially much longer. Relative to long-undisturbed
   forest (167 years old), sites subject to multiple fires, clearcut
   logging or salvage logging were characterized by soils with
   significantly lower values of a range of ecologically important measures
   at multiple depths, including available phosphorus and nitrate.
   Disturbance impacts on soils were most pronounced on sites subject to
   compounding perturbations, such as multiple fires and clearcut logging.
   Long-lasting impacts of disturbance on soil can have major ecological

Abstract = {{Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a threatened species in
   Canada, inhabit landscapes dominated by mature and over-mature
   coniferous stands and tend to avoid areas used by other cervids, wolves
   (Canis lupus), and humans. We hypothesized that habitat modifications
   through logging and forest fire alter the space-use pattern of woodland
   caribou and result ultimately in lowered density. To test this
   hypothesis, density, distribution, space-use patterns, and mortality of
   caribou in disturbed landscapes (DLs) and undisturbed landscapes (ULs)
   of central Quebec were quantified by a systematic aerial survey (42 539
   km(2)) and telemetry of 68 adult caribou females. A ground survey of
   terrestrial and arboreal lichens was carried out to estimate production
   of lichens in DLs and ULs. Three populations that occupied between 10
   000 and 15 000 km(2) were identified in the study area. Caribou
   abundance was not limited by intraspecific competition for food.
   Production of terrestrial lichens was estimated to support 3 to 4 times
   the surveyed caribou density (1.2-2.1.100 km(-2)). Pregnancy rate was
   almost 100\%, indicating that females were not food-limited. Space-use
   patterns were affected by forest disturbance. In DLs, caribou increased
   home range sizes and reduced fidelity to seasonal and annual home
   ranges, probably to avoid disturbed habitats. In response, the
   probability of surviving decreased with the extent of DL within home
   ranges. To help keep direct and indirect sources of caribou mortality at
   very low levels, forest management strategies should be oriented toward
   the protection of large interconnected blocks of forest to favour
   caribou spacing away from humans and predators and to maintain adequate
   space-use strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, it has been observed that most forest fires in Europe
   were caused by people. Extreme droughts, which are more often prolonged,
   can increase the risk of forest fires, not only in southern Europe but
   also, in Central Europe. Nonetheless, catastrophic fire events are not
   well recognized in the Central European Lowlands (CEL), where large
   forest complexes are located. Knowledge of past fire activity in this
   part of Europe is scarce, although several fires have occurred in this
   area during the previous millennia. Large coniferous forest monocultures
   located in the CEL are highly susceptible to fires and other
   disturbances. Here, we present a case study from the Tuchola Pinewoods
   (TP; northern Poland), where large pine monocultures are present. The
   main aim of this study is to document the potential effects past land
   management has on modern day disturbance regimes using state-of-the-art
   paleoecological data, historical documents and cartographic materials.
   We then present a protocol that will help forest managers utilize
   long-term paleoecological records. Based on paleoecological
   investigations, historical documents, and cartographic materials, our
   results show that, in the past 300 years, the TP witnessed not only
   disastrous fires and but also windfalls by tornados and insect
   outbreaks. A change in management from Polish to Prussian/German in the
   18th century led to the transformation of mixed forests into Scots pine
   monocultures with the purpose to allow better economic use of the
   forest. Those administrative decisions led to an ecosystem highly
   susceptible to disturbances. This article provides a critical review of
   past forest management as well as future research directions related to
   the impacts of fire risk on land management and ecosystem services: (a)
   habitat composition and structure (biodiversity); (b) natural water
   management; and (c) mitigation of climate changes. Designated forest
   conditions, management, and future fire risk are a controversial and
   highly debated topic of forest management by Forestry Units. More
   research will allow the gathering of reliable information pertinent to
   management practices with regard to the current fire risks. It is
   necessary to develop a dialog between scientists and managers to reduce
   the risk of fires in projected climate change.}},

Pages = {{293-299}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances are often expected to magnify effects of disease, but these
   effects may depend on the ecology, behavior, and life history of both
   hosts and pathogens. In many ecosystems, wildfire is the dominant
   natural disturbance and thus could directly or indirectly affect
   dynamics of many diseases. To determine how probability of infection by
   the aquatic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) varies relative
   to habitat use by individuals, wildfire, and host characteristics, we
   sampled 404 boreal toads (Anaxyrus boreas boreas) across Glacier
   National Park, Montana (USA). Bd causes chytridiomycosis, an emerging
   infectious disease linked with widespread amphibian declines, including
   the boreal toad. Probability of infection was similar for females and
   the combined group of males and juveniles. However, only 9\% of
   terrestrial toads were infected compared to >30\% of aquatic toads, and
   toads captured in recently burned areas were half as likely to be
   infected as toads in unburned areas. We suspect these large differences
   in infection reflect habitat choices by individuals that affect pathogen
   exposure and persistence, especially in burned forests where warm, arid
   conditions could limit Bd growth. Our results show that natural
   disturbances such as wildfire and the resulting diverse habitats can
   influence infection across large landscapes, potentially maintaining
   local refuges and host behaviors that facilitate evolution of disease
   resistance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances generated by forest restoration treatments have the
   potential for enhancing the establishment of nonnative species thereby
   impeding long-term native plant recovery. In a ponderosa pine forest
   next to the Fort Valley Experimental Forest, Arizona, we examined the
   establishment of nonnative species after three alternative treatments
   with different intensities of tree thinning, coupled with prescribed
   burning and an untreated control, in relation to total species abundance
   and richness. Pretreatment data were collected in 1998 and postreatment
   responses were measured from 2001 through 2006. Total herbaceous cover
   and richness were significantly higher in the two more intensely thinned
   areas compared to the control over the entire post-treatment period.
   Native species were the most prevalent in terms of cover (92\%) and
   richness (90\%) across all treated units, though greater under-story
   plant responses were linked to heavier amounts of tree thinning.
   Nonnative species abundance and richness also increased significantly in
   response to restoration treatments, particularly in the two more intense
   treatments. The proportion of nonnative abundance to the total abundance
   within the two heavily treated areas decreased through time and began to
   converge back towards the undisturbed control unit. One year following
   treatments, 15\% of the total cover (27\%) was composed of nonnative
   species in the heaviest treated unit. This proportion dropped almost
   50\% by the fifth year following treatment. Our results suggest that
   disturbances associated with restoration treatments can facilitate
   establishment of nonnative plants, however the post-treatment plant
   community was increasingly dominated by native species.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Dormancy and germination requirements determine the timing and magnitude
   of seedling emergence, with important consequences for seedling survival
   and growth. Physiological dormancy is the most widespread form of
   dormancy in flowering plants, yet the seed ecology of species with this
   dormancy type is poorly understood in fire-prone vegetation. The role of
   seasonal temperatures as germination cues in these habitats is often
   overlooked due to a focus on direct fire cues such as heat shock and
   smoke, and little is known about the combined effects of multiple
   fire-related cues and environmental cues as these are seldom assessed in
   combination. We aimed to improve understanding of the germination
   requirements of species with physiological dormancy in fire-prone floras
   by investigating germination responses across members of the Rutaceae
   from south eastern Australia. We used a fully factorial experimental
   design to quantify the individual and combined effects of heat shock,
   smoke and seasonal ambient temperatures on germination of freshly
   dispersed seeds of seven species of Boronia, a large and
   difficult-to-germinate genus. Germination syndromes were highly variable
   but correlated with broad patterns in seed morphology and phylogenetic
   relationships between species. Seasonal temperatures influenced the rate
   and/or magnitude of germination responses in six species, and interacted
   with fire cues in complex ways. The combined effects of heat shock and
   smoke ranged from neutral to additive, synergistic, unitive or negative
   and varied with species, seasonal temperatures and duration of
   incubation. These responses could not be reliably predicted from the
   effect of the application of single cues. Based on these findings, fire
   season and fire intensity are predicted to affect both the magnitude and
   timing of seedling emergence in wild populations of species with
   physiological dormancy, with important implications for current fire
   management practices and for population persistence under climate
   change.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study we analyzed the combined effects of management
   (grazing, mowing, prescribed burning, sod-cutting) and atmospheric
   deposition on N and P budgets of heathland ecosystems (Luneburger Heide
   nature reserve; N Germany). We hypothesize that management measures such
   as grazing and mowing can accelerate a deposition-induced imbalance of N
   and P pools as a result of a disproportionally high output of P. We
   analyzed management and deposition affected input-output flows of N and
   P and related them to changes in the nutritional status of Calluna
   vulgaris 5 years after treatment application. We found that grazing and
   mowing caused the highest net loss of P due to high P concentrations in
   the aboveground biomass. In contrast, prescribed burning only slightly
   affected P pools, as P remained in the system due to ash deposition.
   Management-mediated effects on N and P pools were mirrored in the
   nutritional status of Calluna vulgaris: at the grazed and mown sites,
   the P content of current season's shoots significantly decreased within
   5 years after treatments, whereas the N content remained unchanged. We
   conclude that grazing and mowing can accelerate declining availability
   of P and, thus, accelerate a deposition-induced shift from N- to
   P-limited plant growth in the medium term. In the face of ongoing
   atmospheric N loads management schemes need to combine high- and
   low-intensity measures to maintain both a diverse structure and balanced
   nutrient budgets in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread habitat degradation and uncharacteristic fire, insect, and
   disease outbreaks in forests across the western United States have led
   to highly publicized calls to increase the pace and scale of forest
   restoration. Despite these calls, we frequently lack a comprehensive
   understanding of forest restoration needs. In this study we demonstrate
   a new approach for evaluating where, how much, and what types of
   restoration are needed to move present day landscape scale forest
   structure towards a Natural Range of Variability (NRV) across eastern
   Washington, eastern Oregon, and southwestern Oregon. Our approach builds
   on the conceptual framework of the LANDFIRE and Fire Regime Condition
   Class programs. Washington-Oregon specific datasets are used to assess
   the need for changes to current forest structure resulting from
   disturbance and/or succession at watershed and regional scales.
   Across our analysis region we found that changes in current structure
   would be needed on an estimated 4.7 million+ ha (40\% of all coniferous
   forests) in order to restore forest structure approximating NRV at the
   landscape scale. Both the overall level and the type of restoration need
   varied greatly between forested biophysical settings. Regional
   restoration needs were dominated by the estimated 3.8+ million ha in
   need of thinning and/or low severity fire in forests that were
   historically maintained by frequent low or mixed severity fire
   (historical Fire Regime Group I and III biophysical settings). However,
   disturbance alone cannot restore NRV forest structure. We found that
   time to transition into later development structural classes through
   successional processes was required on approximately 3.2 million ha
   (over 25\% of all coniferous forests). On an estimated 2.3 million ha we
   identified that disturbance followed by succession was required to
   restore NRV forest structure.
   The results of this study are intended to facilitate the ability of
   local land managers to incorporate regional scale, multi-ownership
   context into local forest management and restoration. Meeting the
   region-wide restoration needs identified in this study will require a
   substantial increase in the pace and scale of restoration treatments and
   coordination amongst governments, agencies, and landowners. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Shrub encroachment into grasslands is a worldwide phenomenon with no
   signs of abating and numerous ecological consequences. In South Texas,
   honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) and huisache (ilachenia
   farnesiana {[}L.] Wight \& Arn.) are two shrubs encroaching into coastal
   prairies, reducing cover of the dominant native grass, gulf cordgrass
   (Spartina spartinae {[}Trin.] Merr. ex Hitchc.), and decreasing habitat
   for the endangered Aplomado Falcon (Falco femoralis), which requires
   grasslands or savannas for survival. To determine the best management
   approach for deterring shrub encroachment and restoring native
   grasslands, the US Fish and Wildlife Service used several shrub removal
   techniques within coastal prairies of the Bahia Grande Wetland Complex
   of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, a core site for
   Aplomado Falcon reintroductions. Here, we assess native grass recovery
   over a 2-yr period in response to these shrub removal methods
   (mechanical plus prescribed fire and/or herbicide treatments) and degree
   of shrub encroachment before treatment. In general, areas with high
   levels of shrub encroachment before treatment had the highest amount of
   bare ground and lowest grass cover immediately following an initial
   mechanical treatment; this legacy effect persisted throughout the study
   irrespective of shrub removal treatment. Regardless of degree of shrub
   encroachment before treatment, grasses in areas treated with either
   mechanical or mechanical followed by herbicide methods recovered the
   slowest, likely due to residual woody material that hindered seed
   germination. Herbicide treatment following mechanical removal or
   mechanical removal plus fire effectively hindered shrub regrowth.
   Overall, mechanical treatment followed by prescribed fire and then
   herbicide application most effectively promoted grass recovery while
   hindering shrub regrowth. These findings suggest that grassland recovery
   following shrub encroachment into South Texas coastal prairies may be
   promoted through the application of shrub removal methods that combine
   mechanical, fire, and herbicide treatments. (C) 2018 The Society for

   outstanding qualities. Unlike old-growth forests, CESFs have received
   little attention in conservation and reserve management. Thus, we

Abstract = {{Pinyon juniper (Pinus-Juniperus) persistent woodland (PJPW) is
   widespread in western North America. This study examined changes in PJPW
   on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP), Arizona, USA
   based on resampling study plots established in 1935 that are the
   earliest-known, landscape-level, quantitative documentation of PJPW.
   Resampling provided data essential to understanding post-1935 dynamics
   and current conditions, as well as developing ecologically based
   management practices.
   Plots were divided into Core PJPW, Transition PJPW-Ponderosa Pine Forest
   (PJPW-PPF), and Seral PJPW. These differed greatly in their post-1935
   vegetation dynamics. Core PJPW experienced high mortality of
   mid-diameter Juniperus osteosperma (JUGS) and Pinus edulis (PIED), large
   losses of total basal area, and increases of small-diameter JUOS. In
   context of other research, these changes indicate drought during
   1953-1956,1959-1964, and 2002-2011 led to increased mortality of JUOS
   and PIED and that Core PJPW is a dynamic system with phases of tree
   recruitment and mortality related to climate. In contrast, Transition
   PJPW-PPF was generally stable, likely as a result of less drought stress
   at the relatively high elevation where PJPW intergrades with PPF. Seral
   PJPW plots were early successional in 1935 and provided a uniquely long,
   quantitative documentation of succession. They changed most among the
   PJPW subtypes with large increases in total tree density and basal area
   as plots transitioned into tree dominated successional stages.
   Current conditions of Core PJPW in GCNP provide a model for restoration
   of PJPW in areas of similar environment. Elsewhere, managers should
   consider using contemporary data from the area's least disturbed PJ
   vegetation. In general, the ultimate goal should be to restore to the
   least-altered present, not attempt to re-establish the past.
   Likewise, findings suggest ongoing management of PJPW in protected areas
   should not focus on restoration of historical stand structure and
   composition, as done in PPF. Instead, management should emphasize
   leaving naturally occurring processes unimpaired. These include
   disturbances such as stand-replacing fire and native insect outbreaks
   that historically led to varied spatial and temporal stand composition
   and structure. However, active management may be needed when modern
   anthropogenic factors have potential to substantially alter key
   processes, e.g., if increasing cover of invasive plants such as cheat
   grass (Bromus tectorum) is likely to change the historical fire regime.
   Also, management plans for adjacent vegetation types such as PPF,
   shrublands, and grasslands need to consider potential short- and
   long-term impacts on PJPW. Additional challenges to management of PJPW
   are likely to arise with further climate change. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti) is often used as an indicator
   species in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests.
   Because of more than a century of fire suppression, grazing, and timber
   harvest, these forests have become increasingly prone to catastrophic
   wildfire, resulting in pressure to implement large-scale treatments to
   reduce fire threat and restore ecosystem function. However such
   treatments could have dramatic effects on tassel-eared squirrels and
   other wildlife. Because of emerging plans for thinning southwestern
   forests to reduce fire threat, we undertook a modeling effort to produce
   spatial data to examine the results of proposed management actions on
   squirrel habitat. We used squirrel density and recruitment data from 9
   study areas located in the Flagstaff region of northern Arizona, USA,
   linked with spatial data on forest structure developed from
   remote-sensing imagery. We used a multiscale approach to analyze
   relationships between forest structure and squirrel density and
   recruitment. We then used an information-theoretic approach to identify
   the most parsimonious models for both squirrel density and recruitment.
   The most strongly supported models of squirrel density included
   local-scale basal area and > 60\% canopy cover at the 65-ha spatial
   scale. For squirrel recruitment, 4 different models that included both
   local-scale basal area (m(2)/ha) and variations of canopy cover over
   extents of approximately 160-305 ha were strongly supported. Using the
   most parsimonious models, we created spatial data layers representing
   both squirrel density and recruitment across an 800,000-ha landscape in
   northern Arizona. Our approach resulted in spatially explicit models
   that can be used in efforts to predict the effects of forest management
   on squirrel populations.}},

Abstract = {{The western population of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was
   listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to
   extensive population declines. Declines have been linked to site
   conversion of native pine (Pinus spp.) forests for urban development,
   agriculture, and commercial forest management. We conducted surveys to
   detect tortoise burrows on corporate timberlands in southern Mississippi
   and southwestern Alabama during summer 1994. We surveyed 2,759 0.5-ha
   strip transects on soil types of 9 different suitability categories for
   gopher tortoises. We found 460 active and 264 abandoned burrows on the
   1,380 ha surveyed. Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy
   soils and total and midstory canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise
   occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow
   occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related
   negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand
   content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to
   increasing midstory canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils
   and open overstory canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and
   foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow
   occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire,
   midstory control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are
   recommended on gopher tortoise conservation areas and connective
   corridor habitats on commercial timberlands. We theorize that
   restoration of longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests on sandy ridges can
   produce desirable core habitats and dispersal corridors for gopher
   tortoises in landscapes dominated by intensively managed pine
   plantations.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of longleaf pine-dominated uplands is common on many public
   and private lands throughout the southeastern United States. The once
   dominant longleaf pine ecosystem is important to many now-threatened and
   endangered plant and animal species, and land managers are increasing
   efforts to reestablish this fire-dependent forest. Unfortunately, tree
   mortality in longleaf pine has been observed following attempts to
   re-introduce prescribed fire. Root-inhabiting ophiostomatoid fungi and
   their insect vectors have invaded roots of symptomatic longleaf pine.
   Although, the relationship between ophiostomatoid fungi and longleaf
   pine roots is poorly understood. In order to assess the pathogenicity
   and virulence of four ophiostomatoid fungi to longleaf pine, trees
   within two broad age classes (20-30 and 40-60 years) were used for root
   inoculations during the fall of 2006 and 2007 along with the spring of
   2007 and 2008. All fungal species consistently caused resin-filled,
   discolored lesions on the phloem surface extending to the xylem. The
   successful inoculation of healthy longleaf pine roots confirms the
   pathogenicity of Grosmannia huntii, Leptographium procerum,
   Leptographium serpens, and Leptographium terebrantis. G. huntii caused
   the largest lesions, including 22.20 cm(2), 13.37 cm(2), and 9.21 cm(2)
   larger than L procerum, L. terebrantis, and L. serpens respectively. In
   contrast, L procerum caused significantly smaller lesions than all other
   fungi, including 8.65 cm(2) smaller than L terebrantis and 10.69 cm(2)
   smaller than L serpens. Restoration efforts of longleaf pine may be
   affected by fungal root infection in the future. Future studies should
   focus on the interactions between stress factors associated with
   longleaf pine to define more clearly the ecological role of
   root-inhabiting ophiostomatoid fungi in the ecosystem. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Broom matorrals are subjected to extensive burning in the Pyrenees to

   from a few months to 51 years after fire, at 1400-2100 m a.s.l. Overall,
   shrub cover was the main habitat variable affecting the bird community
   composition. The abundance trends of bird species for half a century
   after fire were varied, but population recovery seemed slower
   (especially in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata) than it had been
   reported at a lower altitude. Three species of European conservation
   concern (Alauda arvensis, Lullula arborea and Lanius collurio) showed
   abundance peaks at 10-19 years after fire. This time interval showed the
   highest species richness, abundance and conservation value, whereas
   shrub cover continued to increase afterwards. The bird assemblage tended
   to impoverish with increasing fire severity in the first year after a
   fire. Our results emphasize: (1) the slow recovery of bird community of

Journal = {{USDA FOREST SERVICE INTERMOUNTAIN RESEARCH STATION RESEARCH PAPER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Number = {{489}},
Pages = {{1-\&}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The immediate, visible impacts of forest fires can vary from partial
   consumption of the surface litter and minimal plant charring to high
   consumption of all fuel classes and complete mortality of large stands
   of trees. When fire passes through a stand, trees can be killed outright
   if all or a large portion of the foliage, buds, and branches are killed,
   or they can be mortally wounded if a smaller portion of the living
   tissue is killed. Trees in this latter group will die over several years
   subsequent to the fire with the mortality rate generally decreasing over
   time. Another category includes trees whose vigor has been reduced by
   fire injury, thereby permitting successful insect and disease attacks,
   which commonly result in tree death.
   Standing dead trees have distinctly different influences on ecosystems
   than living trees do. In the first half of this century, snags were
   primarily thought of as fire hazards (Dahms 1949; Keen 1955). Management
   activities at that time included felling dead trees in timber sales and
   along roads. More recently, managers have realized the economic and
   ecological value of snags. Products with direct economic value include
   house logs, firewood, and even lumber (Lyon 1977). As decay spreads
   within the tree, these values diminish and are generally lost when the
   tree falls.
   Apart from economics is the value of standing dead trees for wildlife
   habitat. Birds use such trees to perch, feed, nest, overwinter, and hide
   (Bull 1978). Mammals also use snags to nest or den, feed, and
   overwinter. The value of dead trees for habitat dramatically changes
   when standing trees become fallen logs because bird nest and perch use
   is greatly reduced. These logs, however, are important for hiding and
   thermal cover, feeding, and nesting for ground birds (grouse) and small
   mammals (rabbits and squirrels) (Thomas and others 1979). As they decay,
   logs also ameliorate soil moisture and nutrient condition for plant
   growth (Harvey and others 1988).
   Dead trees are also an important forest fuel. They ignite more easily
   than live trees and, therefore, represent a higher potential source of
   burning embers that can aid wildfire spread. After falling, logs
   represent a potentially high concentrated heat source causing problems
   for fire suppression and sometimes resulting in microsite soil
   degradation.
   Knowledge of the transition rate from standing dead trees to fallen logs
   would be important for those who manage timber and soil resources,
   wildlife habitat, and wildland fuels. Others have reported on the fall
   rate of beetle-killed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) (Keen 1955;
   Schmid and others 1985), beetle- and fire-killed Jeffrey pine (Pinus
   jeffreyi) and white fir (Abies concolor) (Raphael and Morrison 1987),
   and fire-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) (Lyon 1984).
   This study describes 10 year fall rates of second-growth ponderosa pine
   following mortality from different levels of crown scorch sustained in
   different seasons of prescribed burns.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{501-521}},

Abstract = {{Resources are produced in pulses in many terrestrial environments, and
   have important effects on the population dynamics and assemblage
   structure of animals that consume them. Resource-pulsing is particularly
   dramatic in Australian desert environments owing to marked spatial and
   temporal variability in rainfall, and thus primary productivity. Here,
   we first review how Australia's desert mammals respond to fluctuations
   in resource production, and evaluate the merits of three currently
   accepted models (the ecological refuge, predator refuge and fire-mosaic
   models) as explanations of the observed dynamics. We then integrate
   elements of these models into a novel state-and-transition model and
   apply it to well-studied small mammal assemblages that inhabit the vast
   hummock grassland, or spinifex, landscapes of the continental inland.
   The model has four states that are defined by differences in species
   composition and abundance, and eight transitions or processes that
   prompt shifts from one state to another. Using this model as a template,
   we construct three further models to explain mammalian dynamics in
   cracking soil habitats of the Lake Eyre Basin, gibber plains of the
   Channel Country, and the chenopod shrublands of arid southern Australia.
   As non-equilibrium concepts that recognise the strongly intermittent
   nature of resource pulsing in arid Australia, state-and-transition
   models provide useful descriptors of both spatial and temporal patterns
   in mammal assemblages. The models should help managers to identify when
   and where to implement interventions to conserve native mammals, such as
   control burns, reduced grazing or predator management. The models also
   should improve understanding of the potential effects of future climate
   change on mammal assemblages in arid environments in general. We
   conclude by proposing several tests that could be used to refine the
   models and guide further research.}},

Abstract = {{The only remaining wild population of the endangered Whooping Crane
   (Grus americana) winters in salt marsh habitats of the Texas (U.S)
   coast. Whooping Cranes are known to respond and utilize nearby upland
   habitats after a pre treatment has been applied. We investigated several
   factors that may attract Whooping Cranes to recently burned sites at
   Aransas National Wildlife Refuge between 1982 and 1994 and whether
   cranes utilize upland habitats primarily in response to a recent fire
   treatment or whether they occur regularly on uplands regardless of
   burning. We evaluated the effect of different years, bunt site location,
   date of burn, and acorn production on crane use of specific burn sites.
   Crane use was determined with ground surveys from 1982 through 1985 and
   from weekly aerial surveys between 1986 and 1994. Whooping Cranes used
   fire-treated upland habitats to a significantly greater extent than
   unburned sites. The response of cranes to recently burned sites was
   greatest immediately after fire treatment and declined with time. No
   significant difference was found in crane use of burned sites among
   different years. Similarly, time of burn and acorn production had no
   significant effect on crane use of fire-heated habitats. Crane use among
   specific burn units differed significantly. We suggest that Whooping
   Cranes may be using fire-treated upland habitats to feed on recently
   filled vertebrates and invertebrates plus recently exposed plant items.
   Because cranes primarily inhabit salt marsh habitats, the availability
   of alternate food sources may be of considerable importance,
   particularly during years when marsh foods are scarce. But because it
   appears that areas must be burned to facilitate use by Whooping Cranes,
   we suggest that the extent of prescribed burning be based on reduced
   availability of marsh food resources and not on acorn production
   estimates alone.}},

Abstract = {{Prior to Euro-American settlement of the Oak Openings in northwestern
   Ohio, the proportion of oak savanna, woodland and forest in upland sites
   likely varied, with open canopies developing during dry periods of
   higher fire frequency and denser canopies developing during wet periods

   the landscape because of spring flooding, likely contained savanna
   species and, therefore, may have been sources of propagules of savanna
   species that colonized areas of newly opened canopy. We used regression
   analysis to test the hypothesis that the richness and diversity of
   savanna species in the herb layer of present-day savanna are related to
   the proximity of former wet prairie and oak barrens. Results were

   This suggests that wet prairie and oak barrens may have acted as refugia

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1141-1169}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This literature review concerns insect responses to fire, compared to
   other feasible and appropriate conservation managements of open
   habitats. Many insect groups decline markedly immediately after fire,
   with the magnitude of reduction related to the degree of exposure to the
   flames and mobility of the insect. Niche diversity is lower in recently
   burned habitat, and the rate of insect increase following fire also
   relates to the species' ability to gain access to the regrowing
   vegetation. Postburn flora can be quite attractive to some recolonizing
   insects, possibly to some degree a result of fire-caused insect
   mortality which provides plants with short-term release from insect
   herbivory. Insect declines may follow immediately after mowing, but
   usually of lesser degree and shorter duration than after a fire of
   comparable timing and size. Season and scale of cutting may affect how
   much and which species showed positive or negative responses. Cut areas
   offer the vegetational structure and composition preferred by some
   insects, but cutting - or cutting at certain scales, seasons, or
   frequencies - may also be unfavorable for some species. Heavy grazing
   results in niche and assemblage simplification. Nonetheless, some
   invertebrates prefer the short turfs and bare ground resulting from
   heavier grazing. Other species vary in whether they peak in abundance
   and diversity in intermediate, light, or no grazing. In comparisons of
   mowing/haying and grazing regimes of similar compatibility with
   maintenance of the same habitat types, responses of particular species
   and species groups varied as to whether they had a preference for one or
   the other. Characteristics associated with insect responses to fire
   related to the degree of exposure to lethal temperature and stress
   experienced in the post-fire environment, suitability of post-treatment
   vegetation as habitat, and ability to rebuild numbers in the site (from
   survivors and/or colonizers). These factors appear equally useful for
   explicating insect responses to other managements such as haying,
   mowing, and grazing. By contrast, the assumption that the most
   habitat-restricted species will be most adapted to ecological forces
   believed to be prevalent in that ecosystem appears less efficacious for
   predicting insect management preferences.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{894-900}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In the last two centuries, European fire suppression practices have
   produced increases in vegetation density and canopy cover in many
   landscapes. Potentially, increases in canopy cover could negatively
   affect small populations of nocturnal reptiles that use sun-exposed
   shelters for diurnal thermoregulation. We hypothesized that vegetation
   encroachment over rock outcrops might partly explain the recent decline
   of Australia's most endangered snake, the Broad-headed Snake
   Hoplocephalus bungaroides. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a
   field study in Morton National Park, southeastern Australia. We removed
   overhanging vegetation from above shaded rocks and compared their
   subsequent usage by reptiles to control (shaded) rocks. In spring, one
   year after canopy removal, experimental rocks were 10.3 C hotter than
   control rocks and were used as diurnal retreat sites by three species of
   reptiles, including the endangered Broad-headed Snake and its prey
   (Velvet Gecko, Oedura lesueurii). By contrast, no reptiles used control
   rocks as diurnal retreat sites. Our results show that modest canopy
   removal (similar to 15\% increase in canopy openness) can restore
   habitat quality for nocturnal reptiles. Future studies are needed to
   examine whether controlled burns can maintain an open canopy above
   sandstone rock outcrops. However, until effective fire management
   measures are in place, sapling removal from overgrown rock outcrops
   could help to protect small populations of endangered reptiles.}},

   availability of drinkable water in the future. A monetary variable
   consisting of an increase in the rate for entry to the area was also
   incorporated to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for additional
   protection for the selected attributes. Three hundred four Chilean

Abstract = {{Intensive pine (Pinus spp.) management is a dominant form of forest
   management in the southeastern United States. Previous research has
   shown that managed pine forests provide suitable habitat for eastern
   wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), but little research has
   examined seasonal habitat selection for female wild turkeys from a
   landscape perspective, particularly within managed pine landscapes.
   Therefore, we used a long-term (1986-1993) data set to describe seasonal
   habitat selection by female wild turkeys, using an information-theoretic
   approach from a landscape perspective, on an intensively managed pine
   landscape. Habitat use patterns during preincubation and autumn-winter
   were indicative of female wild turkeys moving between a bottomland
   hardwood-agricultural field complex during autumn-winter and upland
   managed pine stands during the remainder of the year. During spring and
   summer, female wild turkeys used landscapes primarily composed of
   intensively managed pine, including thinned and burned stands and
   roadsides. Our results confirm results of short-term, stand-based
   habitat analyses on our study area. We recommend variable fire return

Abstract = {{In the western United States, forests are experiencing novel
   environmental conditions related to a changing climate and a suppression
   of the historical fire regime. Mixed-conifer forests, considered
   resilient to disturbance due to their heterogeneity in structure and
   composition, appear to be shifting to a more homogeneous state, but the
   timescale of these shifts is not well understood. Our objective was to
   assess the effects of climate and fire suppression on stand dynamics and
   demographic rates of an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra
   Nevada. We used a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to quantify species and
   community rates of recruitment, growth, and mortality. Despite a warming
   climate, we found that stand density, basal area, and carbon have
   increased over 56 years. Fir recruitment and growth significantly
   exceeded the community-level median rates, whereas pine recruitment and
   growth was significantly lower than the community-level median rates.
   Shifts in species composition from a well-mixed stand to a more dense
   fir-dominated stand appear to be driven by low growth and recruitment
   rates of pines relative to firs. In forests such as these with
   consistent and relatively low mortality rates, we recommend that
   restoration and management activities be focused on promoting pine
   recruitment and growth.}},

Abstract = {{To effectively manage landscapes that support species with complex life
   cycles, managers should consider how current practices affect habitats
   these organisms rely on in each life stage. Prescribed fire is a
   landscape level disturbance that may alter both aquatic and terrestrial
   habitat characteristics. However, our knowledge of the effects of fire
   on amphibians is primarily limited to adult responses in terrestrial
   habitats. Here we present an integrated approach to test the response of
   Cope's Gray Treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) to fire across terrestrial and
   aquatic habitats by examining responses in tadpole performance and
   survivorship, adult abundance, and oviposition choice. In a common
   garden experiment, tadpoles reared with unburned leaf litter grew much
   faster those in pools with burned litter. To determine how fire in
   terrestrial and aquatic habitats acts to shape oviposition choice, we
   embedded aquatic mesocosms containing a substrate of either burned or
   unburned leaf litter within burned and unburned terrestrial plots.
   Observed oviposition was an order of magnitude higher in unburned
   terrestrial plots, regardless of the aquatic leaf litter treatment. This
   trend was not driven by differences in adult abundance in burned and
   unburned plots. Our findings are consistent with a scenario where adult
   treefrogs use terrestrial cues to preferentially breed in aquatic sites
   in unburned landscapes where tadpoles also experience greater growth.
   These insights highlight the value of adopting a multi-scale integrative
   approach that links stage and habitat specific effects on abundance,
   behavior, and performance to understanding the effects of anthropogenic
   and natural stressors on animal with complex life cycles.}},

Pages = {{322-365}},
Abstract = {{Canadian boreal woodlands and forests cover approximately 3.09 x 10(6)
   km(2), located within a larger boreal zone characterized by cool summers
   and long cold winters. Warming since the 1850s, increases in annual mean
   temperature of at least 2 degrees C between 2000 and 2050 are highly
   probable. Annual mean temperatures across the Canadian boreal zone could
   be 4-5 degrees C warmer than today's by 2100. All aspects of boreal
   forest ecosystem function are likely to be affected. Further, several
   potential ``tipping elements{''} - where exposure to increasing changes
   in climate may trigger distinct shifts in ecosystem state - can be
   identified across the Canadian boreal zone. Approximately 40\% of the
   forested area is underlain by permafrost, some of which is already
   degrading irreversibly, triggering a process of forest decline and
   re-establishment lasting several decades, while also releasing
   significant quantities of greenhouse gases that will amplify the future
   global warming trend. Warmer temperatures coupled with significant
   changes in the distribution and timing of annual precipitation are
   likely to cause serious tree-killing droughts in the west; east of the
   Great Lakes, however, where precipitation is generally nonlimiting,
   warming coupled with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may stimulate
   higher forest productivity. Large wildfires, which can cause serious
   economic losses, are expected to become more frequent, but increases in
   mean annual area burned will be relatively gradual. The most immediate
   threats could come from endemic forest insect pests that have the
   potential for population outbreaks in response to relatively small
   temperature increases. Quantifying the multiple effects of climate
   change will be challenging, particularly because there are great
   uncertainties attached to possible interactions among them, as well as
   with other land-use pressures. Considerable ingenuity will be needed
   from forest managers and scientists to address the formidable challenges
   posed by climate change to boreal ecosystems and develop effective
   strategies to adapt sustainable forest management practices to the
   impending changes.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed winter burning is a common practice in longleaf pine (Pinus

   The effect of these burns on non-target animals is not well studied.
   Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) were captured in predominantly
   Ion-leaf pine stands to be burned and not to be burned at Carolina
   Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge (CSNWR) and the Savannah River Site
   (SRS), South Carolina. Sparrows were marked with radio-transmitters and
   monitored daily. Before burning, daily movements did not differ among
   sites within or among study areas. Additionally, daily movements did not
   differ by sex or time within the breeding season. After prescribed
   burning, daily movements were longer for sparrows in burned stands than
   in unburned stands. All marked sparrows dispersed 1-3 days after a stand
   was burned and never returned. We found no evidence that dispersing
   sparrows successfully breed elsewhere. Bachman's sparrow survival rates
   and reproductive output after burning were lowered. The juxtaposition of
   seen-tingly suitable Bachman's sparrow habitat in relation to burned
   stands influenced both the duration and length of dispersal movements.
   Managers need to consider the proximity of available habitats when
   developing burning plans when managing for Bachman's sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of repeated prescribed fire, mechanical

   midstory of a temperate forest in North Carolina. Using colored pan
   traps, we sampled flower visitors during the plant growing season

   dominated by halictid bees and vespid wasps. Twenty genera of bees
   representing at least 30 species were captured within our experimental
   plots. Within the forest understory, we found higher abundances and
   diversities of bees and other flower visitors within plots that had been
   treated with prescribed fire or a combination of mechanical thinning and
   prescribed fire compared to control plots. Within our midstory samples,
   we found that forest management practices did not affect the abundance
   of any common flower visitor species/family. However, Augochlora pura
   and Vespula spp. were more abundant in the midstory compared to the
   forest understory. Overall, our study demonstrates that repeated
   applications of prescribed fire maintained elevated abundances and
   diversity of bees and other flower-visiting insects compared to
   untreated plots, likely due to increased herbaceous plant diversity and
   enhanced quality of nesting habitat within the understory. Our results
   also indicate that many flower visitors utilize the midstory of a
   temperate forest potentially for foraging habitat.}},

   Populations are small, but connected by dispersing individuals, thus
   forming a metapopulation. Frequency of catastrophic fires was estimated

   A sensitivity analysis was run varying six parameters: three demographic
   (sex ratio, migration and mortality rates), two environmental (K, fire
   frequency) and one genetic (level of inbreeding depression). Genetics,
   K, mortality rates and sex ratio seemed to play major roles to
   population persistence, whereas catastrophes and migration rates had a

Abstract = {{For more than a century ecosystems around the world have experienced an
   increase in the dominance of woody species. While the drivers of woody
   plant proliferation are complex, interactions between climate and
   land-use change are commonly invoked as primary contributing factors. In
   ponderosa pine forests of western North America, substantial increases
   in tree densities are impacting overall forest health and increasing the
   risk for severe wildfires and insect and disease outbreaks. Addressing
   this problem through the use of ecological restoration projects is
   widely advocated. Our objective was to quantify understory vegetation
   response five years after thinning and burning treatments in a
   southwestern ponderosa pine forest. We remeasured plant species richness
   and cover on thinned + burned, burned only, and untreated controls
   replicated four time in a BACI design. An untreated control (Untreated)
   was used for comparison of two alternative restoration treatments (1)
   thinning followed by prescribed fire (Thin + Burn) and (2) prescribed
   fire only (Burn-only). Understory species richness and total plant cover
   increased significantly in Thin + Burn compared to the Untreated and
   Burn-only treatments. Analysis of functional group composition revealed
   increases in species richness and cover was driven primarily by changes
   in annual-biennial forbs and graminoids. We then compared our results
   with those of three Long-term Ecological Restoration and Assessment
   Network (LEARN) sites. We found total and native plant cover showed
   evidence of a consistent response to Thin + Burn treatments across all
   sites. However, results suggest that understory response to restoration
   treatments is under strong environmental control. As a consequence the
   range of variability associated with understory responses should be
   expected to expand or contract depending on where treatments are
   implemented. Overall our findings add to a growing body of literature
   that restoration treatments combining mechanical thinning and prescribed
   fire are useful for increasing native understory abundance and
   diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An unprecedented rate of global environmental change is predicted for
   the next century. The response to this change by ecosystems around the
   world is highly uncertain. To address this uncertainty, it is critical
   to understand the potential drivers and mechanisms of change in order to
   develop more reliable predictions. Australia's Long Term Ecological
   Research Network (LTERN) has brought together some of the longest
   running (10-60 years) continuous environmental monitoring programs in
   the southern hemisphere. Here, we compare climatic variables recorded at
   five LTERN plot network sites during their period of operation and place
   them into the context of long-term climatic trends. Then, using our
   unique Australian long- term datasets (total 117 survey years across
   four biomes), we synthesize results froma series of case studies to test
   two hypotheses: 1) extreme weather events for each plot network have
   increased over the last decade, and; 2) trends in biodiversity will be
   associated with recent climate change, either directly or indirectly
   through climate-mediated disturbance (wildfire) responses. We examined
   the biodiversity responses to environmental change for evidence of
   non-linear behavior. In line with hypothesis 1), an increase in extreme
   climate events occurred within the last decade for each plot network.
   For hypothesis 2), climate, wildfire, or both were correlated with
   biodiversity responses at each plot network, but there was no evidence
   of non-linear change. However, the influence of climate or fire was
   context-specific. Biodiversity responded to recent climate change either
   directly or indirectly as a consequence of changes in fire regimes or
   climate-mediated fire responses. A national long-term monitoring
   framework allowed us to find contrasting species abundance or community
   responses to climate and disturbance across four of the major biomes of
   Australia, highlighting the need to establish and resource long-term
   monitoring programs across representative ecosystem types, which are
   likely to show context-specific responses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Nearly 4 \% of the world's forests are plantations, established to
   provide a variety of ecosystem services, principally timber and other
   wood products. In addition to such services, plantation forests provide
   direct and indirect benefits to biodiversity via the provision of forest
   habitat for a wide range of species, and by reducing negative impacts on
   natural forests by offsetting the need to extract resources. There is
   compelling evidence that climate change is directly affecting
   biodiversity in forests throughout the world. These impacts occur as a
   result of changes in temperature, rainfall, storm frequency and
   magnitude, fire frequency, and the frequency and magnitude of pest and
   disease outbreaks. However, in plantation forests it is not only the
   direct effects of climate change that will impact on biodiversity.
   Climate change will have strong indirect effects on biodiversity in
   plantation forests via changes in forest management actions that have
   been proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the
   productive capacity of plantations. These include changes in species
   selection (including use of species mixtures), rotation length,
   thinning, pruning, extraction of bioenergy feedstocks, and large scale
   climate change driven afforestation, reforestation, and, potentially
   deforestation. By bringing together the potential direct and indirect
   impacts of climate change we conclude that in the short to medium term
   changes in plantation management designed to mitigate or adapt to
   climate change could have a significantly greater impact on biodiversity
   in such plantation forests than the direct effects of climate change.
   Although this hypothesis remains to be formally tested, forest managers
   worldwide are already considering new approaches to plantation forestry
   in an effort to create forests that are more resilient to the effects of
   changing climatic conditions. Such change presents significant risks to
   existing biodiversity values in plantation forests, however it also
   provides new opportunities to improve biodiversity values within
   existing and new plantation forests. We conclude by suggesting future
   options, such as functional zoning and species mixtures applied at
   either the stand level or as fine-scale mosaics of single-species stands
   as options to improve biodiversity whilst increasing resilience to
   climate change.}},

Title = {{Distant neighbors: recent wildfire patterns of the Madrean Sky Islands
   of southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Information about contemporary fire regimes across the Sky
   Island mountain ranges of the Madrean Archipelago Ecoregion in the
   southwestern United States and northern Mexico can provide insight into
   how historical fire management and land use have influenced fire
   regimes, and can be used to guide fuels management, ecological
   restoration, and habitat conservation. To contribute to a better
   understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of fires in the region
   relative to environmental and anthropogenic influences, we augmented
   existing fire perimeter data for the US by mapping wildfires that
   occurred in the Mexican Sky Islands from 1985 to 2011.
   Results: A total of 254 fires were identified across the region: 99
   fires in Mexico (mu = 3901 ha, sigma = 5066 ha) and 155 in the US (mu =
   3808 ha, sigma= 8368 ha). The Animas, Chiricahua, Huachuca-Patagonia,
   and Santa Catalina mountains in the US, and El Pinito in Mexico had the
   highest proportion of total area burned (>50\%) relative to Sky Island
   size. Sky Islands adjacent to the border had the greatest number of
   fires, and many of these fires were large with complex shapes. Wildfire
   occurred more often in remote biomes, characterized by evergreen
   woodlands and conifer forests with cooler, wetter conditions. The five
   largest fires (>25 000 ha) all occurred during twenty-first century
   droughts (2002 to 2003 and 2011); four of these were in the US and one
   in Mexico. Overall, high variation in fire shape and size were observed
   in both wetter and drier years, contributing to landscape heterogeneity
   across the region.
   Conclusions: Future research on regional fire patterns, including fire
   severity, will enhance opportunities for collaborative efforts between
   countries, improve knowledge about ecological patterns and processes in
   the borderlands, and support long-term planning and restoration efforts.}},

Volume = {{719}},

Pages = {{77-91}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Refuges protect plant and animal populations from disturbance. Knowledge
   of refuges from disturbance in mediterranean climate rivers (med-rivers)
   has increased the last decade. We review disturbance processes and their
   relationship to refuges in streams in mediterranean climate regions
   (med-regions). Med-river fauna show high endemicity and their
   populations are often exposed to disturbance; hence the critical
   importance of refuges during (both seasonal and supraseasonal)
   disturbances. Disturbance pressures are increasing in med-regions, in
   particular from climatic change, salinisation, sedimentation, water
   extraction, hydropower generation, supraseasonal drought, and wildfire.
   Med-rivers show annual cycles of constrained precipitation and
   predictable seasonal drying, causing the biota to depend on seasonal
   refuges, in particular, those that are spatially predictable. This
   creates a spatial and temporal mosaic of inundation that determines
   habitat extent and refuge function. Refuges of sufficient size and
   duration to maintain populations, such as perennially flowing reaches,
   sustain biodiversity and may harbour relict populations, particularly
   during increasing aridification, where little other suitable habitat
   remains in landscapes. Therefore, disturbances that threaten perennial
   flows potentially cascade disproportionately to reduce regional scale
   biodiversity in med-regions. Conservation approaches for med-river
   systems need to conserve both refuges and refuge connectivity, reduce
   the impact of anthropogenic disturbances and sustain predictable,
   seasonal flow patterns.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The Henslow's Sparrow (Amnodramus henslowii), a species of conservation
   concern, winters primarily in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest
   ecosystems in the southeastern U.S. These pine savannas have been
   reduced to 5\% of their former range, with remaining patches requiring
   active management with fire to maintain characteristic structure and
   plant diversity. Wintering Henslow's Sparrow abundance tracks
   growing-season fires; bird abundance peaks in the winter following
   burning, then declines in subsequent winters. Fire also determines
   dominant plant species, suggesting that Henslow's Sparrows may respond
   to abundance of preferred seeds. To determine diet preferences of
   Henslow's Sparrows, we tested seeds from eight species of native plants
   from southeastern Louisiana pine savannas, including species common in
   the first winter after burning ('fire Brasses') and species that
   increase in abundance in the second and subsequent winters after
   burning. Seed consumption by individual birds differed considerably,
   suggesting that Henslow's Sparrows forage on a variety of resources in
   the highly diverse savannas. Henslow's Sparrows preferred fire grasses,
   especially Muhlenbergia expansa (cutover muhly). They also preferred
   Dichanthelium angustifoliurn (needleleaf rosette grass), a species more
   common in the second year after burning, but consumed relatively little
   of the sedges Rhynchospora plumosa (plumed beaksedge) and R. gracilenta
   (slender beaksedge), species common in the second winter after fire.
   Birds consumed almost none of the ubiquitous grass Schizachyrium
   scoparium (little bluestem). These results suggest that preferred seeds
   may include those that are most common in the first winter after
   burning, but that some suitable seeds are available for at least another
   winter.}},

Abstract = {{Land management practices, invasive species expansion, and changes in

   natural areas. Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp.
   wyomingensis), a keystone species in the Great Basin, has seen a 50\%

   efforts have focused on direct seeding but achieved only minor success
   due to irregular seed germination and poor survival. We investigated the
   effects of container volume and fertilization on the performance of
   nursery-grown Wyoming big sagebrush seedlings following outplanting.
   Additionally, to evaluate the impact of site preparation, one-year-old
   seedlings were outplanted into tilled and untilled field conditions.
   Initial seedling size increased with container volume; larger seedlings
   exhibited significantly higher root collar diameter (RCD) growth than
   smaller seedlings. As container volume increased from 108 to 251 and 336
   cm(3), seedling survival on the tilled plot increased from 28 to 44 and
   43\%, respectively, whereas no influence was observed on the untilled
   plot (57 to 61, and 60\%, respectively). Fertilization reduced seedling
   survival on tilled (by 25\%) and untilled (by 14\%) plots. Fertilizer
   increased RCD growth on the untilled plot but final nutrient status was
   unaffected. Thus, container volume may influence seedling morphology and
   optimize establishment, while field fertilization, especially during
   spring outplanting when planting sites have low moisture availability,
   may hinder first-year survival.}},

Abstract = {{Understory fires are important for the maintenance of pine savanna
   ecosystems of the southeastern U.S., which contain high biodiversity and
   numerous federally endangered species. Prescribed burns are administered
   to maintain the open structure of pine savannas, conserve biodiversity,
   and to reduce wildfire hazard. However, relatively little research has
   examined which factors control the effects of prescribed burns on mature
   trees, and how responses might be altered by changing climate. The
   impact of prescribed burning on growth responses is likely to vary by
   tree species and by environmental conditions. To test the importance of
   these factors, tree cores were taken from mature Pinus palustris and
   Pinus serotina individuals at multiple locations across Fort Bragg, NC,
   a military preserve with detailed records on prescribed burn history
   dating back to 1991. Individual trees were sampled along the hydrologic
   gradient from xeric uplands to streamside wetlands. Annual growth was
   modeled as a function of species identity, hydrologic position, fire
   history, and climate conditions. We determined that prescribed burning
   produced a moderate decline in annual growth indicating that stress from
   prescribed burns outweighs benefits from increased water and nutrient
   availability. We found that the negative effects from prescribed burning
   were diminished or reversed during warmer years, and that the model
   predicts potential increases in growth during burn years under
   anticipated climate change scenarios. Surprisingly, there were no
   significant differences in growth rate by species or hydrologic
   position. Together these findings suggest that while prescribed burns
   may have minor, short-term impacts on tree growth under most current
   conditions, these effects are small enough that they are unlikely to
   outweigh the many benefits of this management technique for other
   aspects of ecosystem structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Ongoing declines in biodiversity caused by global environmental changes
   call for adaptive conservation management, including the assessment of
   habitat suitability spatiotemporal dynamics potentially affecting
   species persistence. Remote sensing (RS) provides a wide-range of
   satellite-based environmental variables that can be fed into species
   distribution models (SDMs) to investigate species-environment relations
   and forecast responses to change. We address the spatiotemporal dynamics
   of species' habitat suitability at the landscape level by combining
   multi-temporal RS data with SDMs for analysing inter-annual habitat
   suitability dynamics. We implemented this framework with a vulnerable
   plant species (Veronica micrantha), by combining SDMs with a time-series
   of RS-based metrics of vegetation functioning related to primary
   productivity, seasonality, phenology and actual evapotranspiration.
   Besides RS variables, predictors related to landscape structure, soils
   and wildfires were ranked and combined through multi-model inference
   (MMI). To assess recent dynamics, a habitat suitability time-series was
   generated through model hindcasting. MMI highlighted the strong
   predictive ability of RS variables related to primary productivity and
   water availability for explaining the test-species distribution, along
   with soil, wildfire regime and landscape composition. The habitat
   suitability time-series revealed the effects of short-term land cover
   changes and inter-annual variability in climatic conditions.
   Multi-temporal SDMs further improved predictions, benefiting from RS
   time-series. Overall, results emphasize the integration of landscape
   attributes related to function, composition and spatial configuration
   for improving the explanation of ecological patterns. Moreover, coupling
   SDMs with RS functional metrics may provide early-warnings of future
   environmental changes potentially impacting habitat suitability.

   rhizomes and roots initially produced a patchwork of denuded and

   reestablishment of uprooted shoot complexes; regeneration from seed was
   not observed. Regrowth was dependent on intensity of use and
   post-herbivory environmental conditions. After three years of varying
   levels of goose use and environmental conditions, lowest foliar cover
   and standing crop occurred in areas with a high frequency and intensity
   of goose use followed by spring drought and high salinities. Greatest
   growth was associated with low frequency and intensity of use followed

   significantly affect the response of S. americanus. Continued frequent

   periods with water levels below the marsh surface, can produce denuded
   mudflats subject to accelerated soil erosion. Management strategies to

   management of surviving D. hallucatus populations across north-western
   Australia we examined the genetic structure of populations, and
   identified landscape features that influence gene flow within the
   Kimberley region. We sampled 249 individuals from 28 populations in
   three regions of north-western Australia, including the Kimberley,
   Pilbara and Kakadu. Genetic structuring was evident between the three
   regions and to a lesser extent between the north and central Kimberley.
   Landscape genetic analysis of Kimberley populations suggest this
   structuring may be due in part to the indirect effects of differences in
   rainfall between these two areas. Also, D. hallucatus populations with
   large areas of open habitat between them tended to be more genetically
   similar. Managing threats such as the occurrence of intense and frequent
   fires, and the density of introduced herbivores, could support the
   persistence of D. hallucatus populations, particularly in areas with
   high rainfall and flat terrain, where greater genetic connectivity

Abstract = {{Fire is an important management tool for both hazard reduction burning
   and maintenance of biodiversity. The impact of time since last fire on
   fauna is an important factor to understand as land managers often aim
   for prescribed burning regimes with specific fire-free intervals.
   However, our current understanding of the impact of time since last fire
   on fauna is largely unknown and likely dependent on vegetation type. We
   examined the responses of reptiles to fire age in banksia woodlands, and
   the interspersed melaleuca damplands among them, north of Perth, Western
   Australia, where the current prescribed burning regime is targeting a
   fire-free period of 8-12 years. The response of reptiles to fire was
   dependent on vegetation type. Reptiles were generally more abundant
   (e.g. Lerista elegans and Ctenophorus adelaidensis) and specious in
   banksia sites. Several species (e.g. Menetia greyii, Cryptoblepharus
   buchananii) preferred long unburnt melaleuca sites (>16 years since last
   fire, YSLF) compared to recently burnt sites (<12 YSLF). Several of the
   small elapids (e.g. the WA priority listed species Neelaps calonotus)
   were only detected in older-aged banksia sites (>16 YSLF). The
   terrestrial dragon C. adelaidensis and the skink Morethia obscura
   displayed a strong response to fire in banksia woodlands only. Highest
   abundances of the dragon were detected in the recently burnt (<7 YSLF)
   and long unburnt (>35 YSLF) banksia woodlands, while the skink was more
   abundant in older sites. Habitats from a range of fire ages are required
   to support the reptiles we detected, especially the longer unburnt (>16
   YSLF) melaleuca habitat. Current burning prescriptions are reducing the

Abstract = {{Fire frequency is a key land management issue, particularly in tropical
   savannas where fire is widely used and fire recurrence times are often
   short. We used an extended Before-After-Control-Impact design to examine
   the impacts of repeated wet-season burning for weed control on bird
   assemblages in a tropical savanna in north Queensland, Australia.
   Experimentally replicated fire treatments (unburnt, singularly bunt,
   twice burnt), in two habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland),
   were surveyed over 3 years (1 year before the second burn, 1 year post
   the second burn, 2 years post the second burn) to examine responses of
   birds to a rapid recurrence of fire. Following the second burn, species
   richness and overall bird abundance were lower in the twice-burnt sites
   than either the unburnt or singularly burnt sites. Feeding group
   composition varied across year of survey, but within each year, feeding
   guilds grouped according to fire treatment. In particular, abundance of
   frugivores and insectivores was lower in twice-burnt sites, probably
   because of the decline of a native shrub that produces fleshy fruits,
   Carissa ovata. Although broader climatic variability may ultimately
   determine overall bird assemblages, our results show that a short
   fire-return interval will substantially influence bird responses at a
   local scale. Considering that fire is frequently used as a land
   management tool, our results emphasize the importance of determining
   appropriate fire-free intervals.}},

Title = {{Fauna and vegetation responses to fire and invasion by toxic cane toads
   (Rhinella marina) in an obligate seeder-dominated tropical savanna in
   the Kimberley, northern Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{302-314}},
Abstract = {{Context. Changed fire regimes are an important threatening process to
   savanna biodiversity. Fire-sensitive vegetation such as pindan and its
   fauna may be particularly susceptible to fire impacts. Invasion by alien
   species is an additional threatening process. The toxic anuran Rhinella
   marina is a well publicised invader of savannas. Little is known of
   impacts in many habitats.
   Aims. To test the hypotheses (1) that fire responses among pindan fauna
   are greater than general savanna responses, and (2) that cane
   toad-invasion impacts will be reduced relative to riparian habitats.
   Methods. Reptiles, frogs, invertebrates and mammals were surveyed seven
   times from 2008 to 2012, four times before and three times following R.
   marina invasion. Time since last fire was recorded during each survey.
   Vegetation change was measured.
   Key results. Pindan vegetation structural recovery took 4-5 years,
   whereas fauna recovery took only 1 year. Ground active agamids, combined
   Scincidae, fossorial skinks and ground-layer invertebrates responded
   positively to recent fire. Skinks of Ctenotus spp. declined in size
   after fire. Short-term fauna responses reflect rapid re-establishment of
   herbaceous cover. Fauna responses were detected following R. marina
   invasion, including increases in frogs of Uperoleia spp. and skinks of
   Carlia spp., and decreases in Lerista griffini and ground-layer
   invertebrates. Insufficient data were available to test for responses
   among large predators; however, > 50\% lower Varanus spp. trap success
   occurred post-invasion. No invasion response was detected among small
   mammals.
   Conclusions. Pindan fauna fire responses were similar to those of
   savannas. Fauna responses to Rhinella marina invasion were relatively
   minor compared with those previously reported in riparian habitats and
   this may be related to the lower abundance of the invader here than in
   previous studies in riparian or more fertile habitats.
   Implications. The dominant obligate seeding tree in pindan woodland, A.
   tumida, requires > 4 years with no high-intensity fires for
   re-establishment of the dominant tree. Fire management should aim to
   minimise extensive fires to reduce impacts on fire-sensitive fauna.
   Persistence of large predators after cane-toad invasion suggests
   possible refuge value of low-productivity pindan savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Management actions intended to protect or improve habitat for ducks may
   benefit grassland-nesting passerines, but scant information is available
   to explore this assumption. During 1998-2003, we examined nest survival
   of ducks and songbirds to determine whether effects of prescribed fire
   and other habitat features (e.g., shrub cover and distance to habitat
   edges) were similar for ducks and passerines breeding in North Dakota.
   We used the logistic-exposure method to estimate survival of duck and
   songbird nests (n=3,171). We used an information-theoretic approach to
   identify factors that most influenced nest survival. Patterns of nest
   survival were markedly different between taxonomic groups. For ducks,
   nest survival was greater during the first postfire nesting season
   (daily survival rate {[}DSR]=0.957, 85\% CI=0.951-0.963), relative to
   later postfire nesting seasons (DSR=0.946, 85\% CI=0.942-0.950).
   Furthermore duck nest survival and nest densities were inversely
   related. Duck nest survival also was greater as shrub cover decreased
   and as distance from cropland and wetland edges increased. Passerines
   had lower nest survival during the first postfire nesting season
   (DSR=0.934, 85\% CI=0.924-0.944), when densities also were low compared
   to subsequent postfire nesting seasons (DSR=0.947, 85\% CI=0.944-0.950).
   Parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) reduced passerine
   nest survival and this effect was more pronounced during the first
   postfire nesting season compared to subsequent nesting seasons.
   Passerine nest survival was greater as shrub cover decreased and perhaps
   for more concealed nests. Duck and songbird nest survival rates were not
   correlated during this study and for associated studies that examined
   additional variables using the same dataset, suggesting that different
   mechanisms influenced their survival. Based on our results, ducks should
   not be considered direct surrogates for passerines when predicting
   effects of prescribed fire, shrub cover, and habitat edges on nest
   survival. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.
   We examined survival of duck and songbird nests located in northern
   mixed-grass prairies and observed little similarity in patterns of nest
   survival between taxonomic groups in relation to fire, nest cover, and
   habitat edges. Our results suggest ducks should not be used as
   surrogates for passerines in northern mixed-grass prairie when making
   management decisions because different mechanisms, especially predation,
   variably influence ducks and passerines.}},

Abstract = {{Snags create nesting, foraging, and roosting habitat for a variety of
   wildlife species. Removal of snags through postfire salvage logging
   reduces the densities and size classes of snags remaining after
   wildfire. We determined important variables associated with annual
   persistence rates (the probability a snag remains standing from I year
   to the next) of large conifer snags (>= 23 cm diameter breast height
   (dbh)). Our study sites were located within two wildfires in western
   Idaho (Foothills fire of 1992 and Star Gulch fire of 1994). Study sites
   in the Foothills were partially salvage-logged (one-half of standing
   snags >= 23 cm dbh removed), and sites in the Star Gulch burn were
   unlogged. Snags were monitored within 0.04 ha plots for 8-9 years
   beginning in 1994 in Foothills Burn and 1995 in the Star Gulch Burn. A
   total of 1131 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-tir snags
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were monitored during the study period. Data
   were collected on snag species, height, decay class, and diameter at
   breast height. We also collected stand-level data (e.g., slope, aspect)
   and quantified information on remotely sensed data (e.g., pre-fire crown
   closure, burn severity) at the pixel-level (30 m x 30 m) and within I km
   of the plot centers (landscape-level). We modeled annual snag
   persistence as a function of data on all three scales using non-linear
   mixed-effects models. Additionally, we expected that variables on
   multiple scales, including information on burn severity and pre-tire
   crown closure, would be influential in determining snag persistence. The
   best models of snag persistence were selected using an information
   theoretic approach (i.e., AICc). Small-scale variables (age, height,
   dbh, tree species, decay, and snag density) were best predictors for
   both wildfire areas. In contrast to our expectations that large-scale
   variables would influence annual persistence rates, these factors did
   not appear in top models. Persistence was shorter for ponderosa pine
   than Douglas-fir snags. Additionally, smaller snags in plots with fewer
   snags fell sooner than did larger snags in more dense stands. Age of
   snag was also an important variable predicting snag persistence (older
   snags are more likely to fall). Snag longevity (the total amount of time
   the snag remained standing) also varied between the two sites. The
   predicted half-life of a ponderosa pine snag was 7-8 years in
   salvage-logged plots and 9-10 years in unlogged plots. The predicted
   half-life of Douglas-fir snags was longer than ponderosa pine, at 12-13
   years in the salvage logged burn versus 15-16 years in the unlogged
   burn. On the partially logged sites, the primary effects of salvage
   logging on snags appeared to be the reduction of the average snag size
   (diameter and height) and density, which in turn reduced the subsequent
   longevity of individual snags. We concluded that the main effects of the
   partial-salvage logging appeared to be a reduction in overall snag
   density and average snag size which in turn reduces average persistence
   time. Management practices that preserve dense stands of snags will
   promote the longer-term persistence of suitable snags as nesting habitat
   for cavity-nesting birds. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{139-151}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Plant communities dominated by narrow-leaved mallee (Eucalyptus
   cneorifolia) are almost entirely confined to north-eastern Kangaroo
   Island, South Australia, an area which has been extensively cleared for
   agriculture. Consequently, surviving examples consist mostly of small
   remnants which are thought to be senescent due to the exclusion of fire.
   This senescence is associated with the loss of many native understory
   species. Prescribed burns have been suggested as a management tool to
   stimulate the restoration of native plants from the soil seed bank;
   however, no seed bank studies have previously been conducted on Kangaroo
   Island and the seed bank literature usually focuses on particular
   species rather than on plant communities. We conducted an experiment to
   investigate the effects of the fire-related cues heat and smoke on the
   germination of plants from the seed bank in soil sampled from 10
   long-ungrazed narrow-leaved mallee sites on Kangaroo Island. Eighty
   trays of soil were monitored in a controlled glasshouse for five months
   after being subjected to heat and/or smoke treatments. The overall
   number of native, but not exotic, plant species germinating from the
   soil seed bank was significantly increased by all three fire-related
   treatments (heat, smoke and heat plus smoke) compared with the control
   (no fire-related treatment). Different plant life forms exhibited
   varying responses to heat and smoke treatments. The results of this
   study illustrate that the application of fire-related treatments to soil
   seed banks in controlled glasshouse conditions can stimulate the
   recruitment of native species, including several species of conservation
   concern. These findings also indicate the potential of using these
   treatments for the ex situ germination of fire dependent species for
   revegetation purposes and indicate aspects of prescribed burns that may
   be important for restoring different components of native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The potential environmental impact of air pollutants emitted from the
   oil sands industry in Alberta, Canada, has received considerable
   attention. The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic
   crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to
   significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition
   of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also
   potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant's
   chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The
   Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the
   Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve
   monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of
   JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a
   significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and
   Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline
   conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts
   of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air
   contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides {[}NOx], sulfur dioxide {[}SO2],
   volatile organic compounds {[}VOCs], particulate matter with an
   aerodynamic diameter <2.5 m {[}PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric
   products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly
   polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg).
   This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem
   impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through
   approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the
   findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to
   observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region,
   in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The
   existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is
   the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the
   ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their
   potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the
   atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as
   does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions
   and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple
   stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and
   forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to
   attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is
   growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some
   species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC
   exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical
   review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components,
   in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of
   air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific
   understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the
   development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most
   efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands
   environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts.Implications:
   Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to
   be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to
   facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation,
   particularly where uncertainties are the largest.
   Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has
   improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this
   progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil
   sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used
   to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure,
   both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are
   identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at
   current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts
   and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further
   assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality
   prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future
   environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the relative contributions of in situ survival and

   abundance in enclosed and open plots in adjacent burned and unburned

   arthropods at semimonthly intervals following spring burns at each site
   indicated that fire strongly depressed arthropod abundance initially,
   but that abundance and species richness tended to recover toward the end
   of the summer, mostly due to recolonization from adjacent unburned
   refuges. Nevertheless, arthropod groups (taxa or guilds) were affected
   differently by fire, and differences in arthropod species composition
   among burned and unburned plots persisted. Sampled arthropod groups
   significantly reduced by fire at one or both study sites included
   springtails (Collembola), deltocephaline leafhoppers (Homoptera:

   prescribed fire. Thus, to preserve native arthropod faunas, land
   managers should ensure that unburned refuges are maintained and that the

Abstract = {{Habitat management can play a critical role in increasing and

   have significant effects on biodiversity management. In tallgrass
   prairie systems, prescribed burns are a common method to promote
   diversity. Managers prefer winter dormant season burns but this timing
   differs significantly from the historic growing season burns that helped
   shape this community, and it is largely unexplored whether changing burn
   season has significant effects on higher trophic levels. Here we
   investigate how the timing of such burns affects the bee communities and
   their resources. Depending on life history traits such as above or below
   ground nesting, timing of fire management can have differential effects
   on bee diversity. In 2016 and 2017, bees were collected from prairies in
   south-central Illinois using active netting, pan traps, and vane traps,
   and measurements of plant species, flower abundance and ground cover
   were recorded. While both burns showed significant improvement over
   unburned areas, growing season burns had the greatest total bare ground
   area and an increase in overall bee abundances. This may suggest long

   season burns are beneficial for bees, and the use of either burn season
   can be utilized for land management.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-70}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus) populations have been declining
   throughout their range and deteriorating habitat conditions are likely
   one cause of these declines. Reductions in food and cover availability
   along traditional routes may especially influence habitat use during
   migration by mule deer. Forest management practices such as
   underburning, the practice of using low-severity fires to reduce fuel
   loads, are often assumed to be beneficial to deer through enhancement of
   forage quality and quantity. However, these practices may be detrimental
   to mule deer through decreases in food and cover availability.
   Currently, little is known about the effects of underburning on habitat
   use by mule deer during migration. We analyzed Global Positioning System
   tracking data from 187 adult female mule deer in central Oregon, USA,
   from 2005 to 2012 in relation to 243 areas that were underburned between
   1977 and 2009 to assess effects of underburning on habitat use during
   seasonal migrations. During spring migration, mule deer decreased use of
   recently underburned (i.e., <= 7 years-since-burned) areas compared with
   pretreatment use. There was not a difference in use of recently
   underburned areas before and after treatment during autumn migration. In
   spring, the proportion of used underburned areas declined postburn
   without recovering to preburn levels up to 20 years after treatment. The
   proportion of underburned areas used in autumn was much more variable,
   with use of postburn areas fluctuating above the preburn mean but never
   reaching the preburn maximum. We contend that reductions in forage and
   cover availability from underburning may negatively affect migrating
   mule deer, especially during spring. Thus, efforts should be taken to
   minimize burning large, continuous areas along migration routes and
   avoid burning adjacent areas during the same year to maintain a diverse
   mosaic of understory age classes, which will allow deer to make habitat
   use choices during migration. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of medusahead across the western United States has severe
   implications for a wide range of ecosystem services. Medusahead invasion
   reduces biodiversity, wildlife habitat and forage production, and often
   leads to increased fire frequency and restoration costs. Medusahead is
   problematic in the Intermountain West and California Annual Grasslands.
   The last review of medusahead ecology and management was completed 20
   years ago. Since the last review, there have been scientific advances in
   medusahead management suggesting a significant need to develop an
   up-to-date synthesis. Medusahead continues to pose a serious threat to
   rangeland ecosystems. In this synthesis, we present new information
   regarding the ecology of medusahead, suggest a framework for managing
   medusahead based on invasion level, and identify research needs to
   further improve management of this invasive annual grass. Success of
   different management practices varies between the Intermountain West and
   California Annual Grasslands, signifying that the best management
   practices are those specifically tailored with consideration of climate,
   soil, plant community characteristics, and management objectives.
   Prevention and control treatments that are useful in the Intermountain
   West may not be practical or effective in the California Annual
   Grasslands and vice-versa.}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{A survey was conducted in the Borana pastoral areas of southern Ethiopia
   to assess current livestock production systems, rangeland management
   practices and the perceptions of the pastoralists towards rangeland
   degradation. This information is considered vital to future pastoral
   development planning and interventions. Data were collected from a total
   of 20 villages that were identified from 5 peasant associations, namely
   Did Yabello, Moyatte, Did Harra, Dubuluk and Melbana. The average
   household size in the study area was 7.23. The majority of the
   pastoralists relied on both livestock and crop farming. The average
   livestock holding per household was 14 cattle, 10 goats, 6 sheep and 2
   camels. Livestock holdings, with the exception of camels, has shown a
   declining trend over time. The two most important traditional rangeland
   management strategies adopted by the pastoralists included burning and
   mobility, but since 1974/75 burning has no longer been practised. With
   regard to mobility, the livestock herding falls in two categories,
   namely: home based and satellite herding. The former involves the
   herding of milking cows, calves and immature animals (< 2 years) close
   to the encampments. The latter constitutes the herding of bulls and
   immatures (> 2 years) further away from the encampments. Based on the
   pastoralists' perceptions, the major constraints on livestock production
   in descending order, were recurrent drought, feed and water scarcity,
   animal diseases, predators and communal land ownership. All the
   respondents considered the condition of the rangelands to have declined
   dramatically over time. In the past most development policies were based
   on equilibrium theories that opposed the communal use of the rangelands
   and traditional range management practices. The way in which the
   pastoral system affects the rangeland ecosystem functioning is
   contentious to this theory and the `tragedy of the commons'. There was
   also a perceived problem of bush encroachment and the ban on traditional
   burning practices and recurrent droughts were seen as aggravating
   factors to this invasion process. The increasing practice of crop
   cultivation on the rangelands was identified as a serious threat to
   future livestock production and traditional resource management
   practices. Suggestions for possible interventions to improve the
   productivity and sustainable use of these rangelands are made. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Restoration to increase resilience to current and projected drought and
   fire in historically open-canopy forests in fire-prone environments may
   be constrained by concern for species that favor dense forest
   conditions. To assist the recovery of a threatened species, the Northern
   Spotted Owl (NSO), in dry forest environments, the US Fish \& Wildlife
   Service (USFWS) recommends embedding NSO conservation and recovery in
   restoration efforts that enable ecosystem recovery from past management
   actions and increase resilience to changing climate. In this study, we
   assessed changes between historical and current (1) forest structure and
   composition and (2) extent of NSO nesting and roosting (NR) or foraging
   (F) forest cover on 39,000 ha at the eastern edge of the current
   designation of the range of the NSO. Historical records depict a
   predominantly open-canopy landscape dominated by large ponderosa pine.
   Current conditions include more than a 600\% increase in trees 15-53 cm
   dbh, substantial decline in trees >= 81 cm dbh, loss of the widespread
   distribution of trees >= 53 cm dbh, and loss of the dominance of
   ponderosa pine on mixed conifer sites. NSO habitat assessment involves a
   suite of attributes including: landscape context; species composition;
   canopy cover; basal area; average tree diameter; diameter diversity; and
   abundance of large trees, snags, canopy layers, coarse woody debris, and
   mistletoe. We tested for the presence of forest that met USFWS threshold
   values for two of these variables, canopy cover and basal area.
   Historically none of the area met the 60\% canopy cover threshold for NR
   or F forest cover and almost none meets it currently. However, several
   NSO nesting pairs and individual birds have been observed in the study
   area over the last 20 years, and studies in other frequent-fire forests
   show that canopy cover as low as 50\% may be functional for NSO. To
   assess the implications of lower threshold values, we tested for NR or F
   forest cover presence at half the recommended thresholds, considerably
   below published estimates. Only five percent of the area exceeded 30\%
   canopy cover historically; much of the current forest exceeds it today.
   Increase in canopy cover comes at the expense of increasing
   vulnerability to fire and drought and loss of historical functions and
   processes. Conflicting objectives of forest restoration and maintenance
   of spotted owl habitat on this site isolated habitat in the dry margin
   of the range of the NSO - raises questions about how to achieve forest
   restoration in altered landscapes where existing, novel conditions favor
   at-risk species. (C) 2 016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Woody shrubs and herbivory influence tree encroachment in the sandplain

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{441-450}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Tree encroachment into herbaceous and shrub communities is a common
   phenomenon world-wide. Encroachment of the tree Allocasuarina huegeliana
   in sandplain heathland (kwongan) in the Western Australian wheatbelt has
   increased over the past two decades. Little is currently known about the
   factors driving this encroachment or its impacts, and consequently there
   are no scientific guidelines for managing the remaining areas of
   kwongan.
   2. We investigated the effects of four mammal herbivores including
   tammar wallabies Macropus eugenii and kangaroos on the establishment of
   A. huegeliana seedlings in kwongan using selective exclosures in a
   reserve where the tammar wallaby population has recovered to historic
   densities. Using a separate field experiment, we further investigated
   the effects of browsing and perennial shrubs on the establishment of A.
   huegeliana seedlings in several patches of kwongan. Seedling growth,
   survival and levels of browsing were compared in bare ground with no
   vegetation cover, either unfenced to allow access to herbivores or
   fenced to exclude herbivores, and within unfenced shrubs. We also
   investigated the abundance of mammal herbivores in these kwongan patches
   using the scat accumulation method.
   3. Tammar wallabies browsed few seedlings and had little impact on
   seedling growth and survival. Kangaroos browsed extensively on seedlings
   in areas with no vegetation cover and effectively suppressed the growth
   of most seedlings in these areas. However, numerous seedlings
   successfully established in perennial kwongan shrubs where they escaped
   browsing herbivores.
   4. Growth and survival rates of seedlings in shrubs and fenced areas
   with no vegetation cover were similar. Any effects of increased
   competition from shrubs were far outweighed by the benefits that the
   shrubs provided through protection from browsing herbivores.
   5.Synthesis and applications. Perennial kwongan shrubs facilitate the
   establishment of A. huegeliana seedlings by protecting seedlings from
   browsing herbivores. Without kangaroos, encroachment of A. huegeliana in
   kwongan would be much more extensive and rapid; however, active
   management, possibly involving the reinstatement of a more frequent fire
   regime, is required to ensure the conservation of kwongan communities.}},

   in Alaska}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{We investigated wildfire-related effects on a slow ecological variable,
   i.e., forage production, and fast social-ecological variables, i.e.,
   seasonal harvest rates, hunter access, and forage offtake, in a
   moose-hunter system in interior Alaska. In a 1994 burn, average forage
   production increased slightly (5\%) between 2007 and 2013; however, the
   proportional removal across all sites declined significantly (10\%).
   This suggests that moose are not utilizing the burn as much as they have
   in the past and that, as the burn has aged, the apparent habitat quality
   has declined. Areas with a greater proportion of accessible burned area
   supported both high numbers of hunters and harvested moose. Our results
   suggest that evaluating ecological variables in conjunction with social
   variables can provide managers with information to forecast management
   scenarios. We recommend that wildlife managers monitor fast variables
   frequently, e.g., annually, to adapt and keep their management
   responsive as resources fluctuate; whereas slower variables, which
   require less frequent monitoring, should be actively incorporated into
   long-term management strategies. Climate-driven increases in wildfire
   extent and severity and economically driven demographic changes are
   likely to increase both moose density and hunting pressure. However, the
   future resilience of this moose-hunter system will depend on integrated
   management of wildfire, hunter access, and harvest opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Because invasive annual grasses can strongly influence soil resource
   availability and disturbance regimes to favor their own persistence,
   there is a great need to understand the interrelationships among
   invasive plant abundance, resource availability, and desirable species
   prominence. These interrelationships were studied in two salt desert
   sites where the local abundance of downy brome (Bromus tectorurn L.)
   varied spatially and increased more than 12-fold over a 3-yr period. We
   measured downy brome percentage cover, resource availability, and soil
   chemical and physical properties within 112 plots per site and found
   significant negative associations between downy brome abundance and both
   soil water content (P < 0.05; r=-0.27 to -0.49) and nitrate accumulation
   (P < 0.05; r=-0.34 to -0.45), which corroborated with the direction and
   strength of multivariate factor loadings assessed with principal
   component analysis. We then applied factorial combinations of prescribed
   burning and preemergence herbicide at management-relevant scales (i.e.,
   6 to 46 ha) as well as biomass removal to smaller plots (12.25 m(2)) at
   both sites to determine their impact on downy brome, soil resources, and
   resident plant species. Burning and herbicide applications, especially
   when combined, significantly reduced downy brome cover (P=0.069 to
   0.015), which in turn increased soil nitrate accumulation and water
   content in the spring. Furthermore, for one shrubland site that was
   seeded 6 yr previously, the combination of burning and herbicide
   treatments significantly increased perennial grass percentage cover in
   the 2 yr posttreatment (P < 0.05). Results not only demonstrate the
   strong relationships between downy brome abundance, soil resources, and
   residence species for impoverished salt desert shrub ecosystems, but
   also suggest that restoration and management efforts must include
   tactics that facilitate resource use by the residual plant community or
   establish a greater abundance of species capable of high resource
   acquisition in the spring.}},

   radiotelemetry to investigate winter roost-site selection by Seminole
   bats (Lasiurus seminolus) on an intensively managed landscape with
   forested corridors in southeastern South Carolina, USA. We modeled
   roost-site selection with logistic regression and used Akaike's
   Information Criterion for small samples (AIC(c)) and Akaike weights to
   select models relating roost-site selection to plot-and landscape-level
   variables. We tracked 20 adult male bats to 71 individual roosts. Bats
   used a variety of roosting structures, including the canopy of overstory
   trees, understory vegetation, pine (Pinus spp.) needle clusters, and
   leaf litter. Roost height, structure type, and habitat type were
   influenced by changes in minimum nightly temperature. On warmer nights,
   bats selected taller trees in mature forest stands, but when minimum
   nightly temperatures were <4 degrees C, bats typically were found
   roosting on or near the forest floor in mid-rotation stands. We
   recommend avoiding prescribed burning in mid-rotation stands on days
   when the previous night's temperature is < 4 degrees C to minimize
   potential disturbance and direct mortality of bats roosting on or near
   the forest floor. We encourage forest managers to incorporate seasonal

Abstract = {{Studies of insect biodiversity and conservation in Australia have been
   severely limited by the many undescribed species and paucity of
   taxonomists and insect ecologists. In this review, I discuss important
   issues facing insect conservation, namely, key threatening processes,
   threats to habitats and ecological communities, the importance of
   maintaining insect interactions, the value of vegetation remnants in
   agricultural ecosystems and the importance of community participation,
   and provide recommendations for the conservation management of
   invertebrates and their habitats. Major threats to insect biodiversity
   continue from habitat loss through broadscale clearing of native
   vegetation, invasion by weeds, habitat fragmentation, loss of natural
   corridors and inappropriate fire regimes. Other threats include
   disturbance of plant communities on hilltops, creek embankments and in
   water courses, pesticide regimes, trampling and grazing by stock and
   feral animals, and exotic predators. Climate change affects those
   insects constrained by their thermal and moisture tolerances (climate
   envelopes), potentially influencing their distribution, development and
   reproduction, by disrupting diapause and aestivation or inducing torpor.
   Protected areas under State jurisdiction are at risk without
   Commonwealth protection and increasingly threatening those insects
   occurring only in national parks and other conservation areas. For
   effective conservation of mainland national parks, overarching national
   EPBC Act legislation is needed to protect parks for conservation of
   animal and plant diversity and natural landscapes. Retention of native
   vegetation as refuges for beneficial insects near farmlands is known to
   contribute to environmentally clean pest control. Information on
   conservation of beneficial insects and their dependence on native plants
   as habitats is needed by farmers to promote identification and
   protection of natural refuges for pollinators, parasitoids and predators
   and to support the case against indiscriminate tree clearing. Important
   community conservation activities are underway in several States and
   Territories, but to be effective, increased support and funding from
   appropriate agencies is required.}},

Abstract = {{One of the primary conservation threats surrounding sagebrush (Artemisia
   spp.) ecosystems in the Intermountain West of the United States is the
   expansion and infilling of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis, P. monophylla) and
   juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands. Woodland expansion into sagebrush
   ecosystems has demonstrated impacts on sagebrush-associated flora and
   fauna, particularly the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus).
   These impacts have prompted government agencies, land managers, and
   landowners to ramp up pinyon-juniper removal efforts to maintain and
   restore sagebrush ecosystems. Accurately quantifying and analyzing
   management activities over time across broad spatial extents still poses
   a major challenge. Such information is vital to broad-scale planning and
   coordination of management efforts. To address this problem and aid
   future management planning, we applied a remote sensing change detection
   approach to map reductions in pinyon-juniper cover across the
   sage-grouse range and developed a method for rapidly updating maps of
   canopy cover. We found total conifer reduction over the past several yr
   (2011-2013 to 2015-2017) amounted to 1.6\% of the area supporting tree
   cover within our study area, which is likely just keeping pace with
   estimates of expansion. Two-thirds of conifer reduction was attributed
   to active management (1.04\% of the treed area) while wildfire accounted
   for one-third of all estimated conifer reduction in the region (0.56\%
   of the treed area). Our results also illustrate the breadth of this
   management effort-crossing ownership, agency, and state boundaries. We
   conclude by identifying some key priorities that should be considered in
   future conifer management efforts based on our comprehensive assessment.

   fall burning frequencies over a six-year period, we constructed
   stochastic transition matrix models to evaluate the effects of fire on
   the viability of the populations. Stochasticity was incorporated into
   the models through two methods performed by widely used computer
   programs: randomly shuffling whole annual matrices (using POPPROJ2), or
   selecting each matrix element from a distribution with observed mean and
   variance (with RAMAS/stage). Log-linear analysis was used to test for
   site and treatment effects on transition rates. Unburned plots had
   stochastic population growth rates (lambda (s)) of 0.905-0.927,
   depending on the site and stochastic method. Burning twice in six years
   increased X, to 0.946-1.091, and three burns yielded lambda (s) values
   of 0.996-1.173. The risk of extinction (100 yr, extinction defined as <
   10 individuals) was very high (97-99\%) in the absence of fire for both
   methods and sites, but with two burns it declined to 57\% and 73\% for
   matrix selection and element selection, respectively, at one site, and
   less than or equal to 1\% (both methods) at the other. Extinction
   probability was very low (less than or equal to 1\%) for both methods
   and sites after three burns. Although different methods of incorporating
   stochasticity gave slightly different quantitative results, they were
   qualitatively similar. Both site and treatment had significant effects
   on transition rates in the log-linear analyses. Elasticity analysis
   suggested that burning decreased the sensitivity of population growth
   rate to mid-sized plants and increased the importance of seedlings. Fire
   was an effective tool for maintaining viable populations of this
   species, although the strength of its effects differed between
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{As in other savanna biomes, burns are common in the Cerrado biodiversity
   hotspot, profoundly affecting its entire biota. We review the direct and
   indirect effects of fire on lizards and find that previous studies on
   herpetofauna report little or no direct postfire mortality, likely as a
   result of adaptive behaviors, and that studies on indirect effects of
   burns often assume the absence of direct effects on the herpetofauna. We
   investigate the immediate effects of prescribed fires upon lizard
   mortality in three South American Cerrado physiognomies. We also
   investigate the short-term (12 months) effects of fire on lizard
   captures in cerrado sensu stricto, the most widespread Cerrado
   physiognomy. We found no immediate postfire mortality with lizards using
   burrows and termite nests as prime shelters. Most lizard species
   displayed narrowed microhabitat use and reduced activity immediately
   after the fire. Twelve months after the burn, the capture rate of most
   species increased or remained the same as before the fire, whereas
   Mabuya nigropunctata (Scincidae) displayed reduced capture rates. With
   no apparent mortality caused directly by fire, we attribute variation in
   capture rates to changes in habitat structure. These changes may
   represent increased food resources or amelioration of microclimatic and
   structural conditions to the benefit of the majority of lizard species
   but which can also be detrimental to some species. Our results indicate
   that lizards are adapted in many ways to fires in the Cerrado.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires are common natural perturbations in Mediterranean ecosystems.
   Their frequency and extent have changed in recent decades to become one
   of the main ecological problems for wildlife. The response of fauna to
   wildfires depends greatly on the life histories and biological traits of
   each species. Terrestrial gastropods have limited mobility, and their
   presence is restricted by the vegetal and abiotic characteristics of
   habitats. For this reason, they are expected to have a low ability to
   recolonize burned areas. We have explored their survivorship and
   recolonization patterns according to the cryptic-refuge and fire-edge
   models in a Mediterranean protected area affected by a large fire in
   August 2003. The low number of species recorded at burned sites
   demonstrates the negative effects of a wildfire on the richness of
   gastropod assemblages 4 years after the perturbation. However, the total
   number of living individuals did not vary between burned and unburned
   areas, suggesting an after-fire shift in dominant species from woodland
   to open-space species. Forest species with wide European distributions
   dominated in unburned sites, whereas open-space species and xerophytic
   Mediterranean species were present at burned sites. These differences
   were evident even at the burned sites closest to the unburned forest,
   suggesting low recolonization rates from the fire edge. By contrast, the
   abundance of xerophilous species as well as isolated records of
   mesophilous species in the burned areas suggests the survival of small
   populations and further recuperation after fire following the
   cryptic-refuge model.}},

   the effect of forest restoration practices on biodiversity indicators

   these stands the goldcrest (Regulus regulus) was the best biodiversity
   indicator. Based on habitat associations, we suggest that biodiversity
   indicators in boreal forest not only indicate high species richness but
   also structural habitat complexity. Our results draw attention to the
   fact that one must be careful about using previously identified
   biodiversity indicators in ecosystems subjected to ecological

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is a commonly used management technique for maintaining
   fire-adapted ecosystems, yet empirical data regarding its effects on
   amphibians are limited and contradictory. Anurans (frogs and toads) may
   be the amphibian taxa most negatively affected by fire due to their
   extensive use of the forest floor; however, short-term abundance studies
   suggest that terrestrial toads (e.g., Anaxyrus {[}Bufo] americanus) may
   benefit from fire-based ecosystem management. We used radio-telemetry to
   examine the effects of prescribed fire on movements, home range
   characteristics, mortality, and habitat selection of A. americanus in a
   southern Appalachian upland hardwood forest. We tracked 26 adult A.
   americanus between 27 January and 30 May 2012. Toads exhibited high
   non-breeding site fidelity and traveled 993.5 m (+/- 265.9 m) mean (+/-
   SD) route distance between the breeding ponds and the last recorded
   location within their summer habitat. We found no evidence of direct
   mortality of A. americanus from a prescribed fire that occurred on 13
   February 2012. Forward stepwise discriminant analysis (DA) revealed that
   the availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) was a significant
   discriminator between microhabitats used (i.e., location plots) and
   random plots (Wilk's lambda = 0.9852, F-1,F- 661 = 9.9414, p = 0.002).
   Forward stepwise DA revealed that burned and unburned location plots
   were significantly different (Wilk's lambda = 0.2713, F-1,F- 221 =
   593.6863, p < 0.001) based on the percent of plot ground cover comprised
   of charred material (\%char). When \%char was excluded from the analysis
   due to its short-term nature, the percent of plot ground cover comprised
   of deciduous leaves, a cover item commonly used by toads in unburned
   locations, was the variable with the most discriminatory power (Wilk's
   lambda = 0.4243, F-1,F- 221 = 299.8741, p < 0.001). Toads maintained
   greater distances from CWD in the unburned (mean +/- SD = 119.50 +/-
   109.64 cm) than in the burned locations (mean +/- SD = 86.05 +/- 104.81
   cm; chi(2)(1)= 9.7055, p = 0.002). Our results indicate that prescribed
   fire as implemented in this study did not cause direct mortality, nor
   did it appear to inhibit migratory movements of adult A. americanus.
   However, fire reduced the diversity and availability of refugia,
   especially deciduous leaves, though the availability of alternative
   cover objects (e.g., CWD) in burned treatments allowed toads to inhabit
   those areas, suggesting the importance of noncombustible or
   semi-permanent refugia for A. americanus in fire-managed forests. (C)

Abstract = {{Meyer's Parrot Poicephalus meyeri has the widest distributional range of
   any African parrot. There are six subspecies distributed throughout the
   African subtropics, all of which manage to breed successfully during the
   winter dry season when few other cavity-nesting birds are actively
   nesting. In 2004, we recorded Meyer's Parrots feeding on four cryptic
   arthropod larvae incubating inside fruits and pods in their seasonal
   diet. All of these were previously unknown in the diet of African
   parrots. Nesting females and chicks were fed regurgitate almost
   exclusively comprising these arthropod larvae for the first 10 weeks
   after nest occupation. In 2007, we demonstrated that Meyer's Parrots
   actively search for these protein-rich arthropod larvae and synchronized
   their breeding effort within our study area to coincide their hatching
   period with the period of highest relative abundance of these larvae,
   resulting in a breeding synchrony index value of 79.3 \% between females

   closest congeners, the Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus and
   Ruppell's Parrot P. rueppellii. Poor land management practices (e.g.

Abstract = {{This study investigated associations between the relative abundance of
   the threatened ngwayir (western ringtail possum, Pseudocheirus
   occidentalis) and anthropogenic disturbances at local and landscape
   scales within the publicly-managed jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests
   of south-western Australia. Logging, fire, fox (Vulpes vulpes) control
   and forest fragmentation were investigated in relation to the relative
   abundance of ngwayir at 90 sites within an area of 285,000 ha east of
   Manjimup; the location of the last remaining substantial population of
   ngwayir in jarrah forest. Overall, ngwayir abundance was greatest in
   areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. At the local-scale,
   ngwayir abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity.
   At the landscape-scale, it was positively associated with fox control
   and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from
   non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations).
   Abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in
   forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the
   landscape was most recently logged, in other words, where logging was
   historically least intense. Interactions between fox control efforts and
   forest fragmentation were also important. This study emphasises the
   importance of conducting research at appropriate spatial scales and to
   account for the synergistic effects of the causes of decline. An
   adaptive management approach to the mitigation of the agents of decline
   is recommended.
   Indirect evidence indicates that high value habitat for ngwayir has in
   all likelihood been selectively cleared for agriculture, owing to its
   fertile and productive nature. Habitat loss is, therefore, also likely
   to be a major cause of the modern decline of the species. While many
   jarrah forest areas that support remaining high abundances of the
   ngwayir have been incorporated into reserves, conservation of ngwayir
   habitat and populations outside reserves also will be essential for the
   recovery and long-term viability of the species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have experienced
   severe declines for several decades, and declines have been particularly
   precipitous in the southern United States. These declines are partially
   attributable to large-scale conversions of potential habitat to
   short-rotation pine (Pinus spp.) forests managed for wood fiber
   production and fire exclusion in pine-dominated landscapes. We used
   standard arthropod sampling techniques, human-imprinted bobwhite chicks,
   and vegetation response to evaluate effects of different understory
   vegetation management practices on brood habitat quality within a
   commercially managed pine forest in Louisiana, USA, during 2002-2005.
   Specifically, we evaluated effects of mowing, prescribed fire during the
   growing season, prescribed fire in combination with imazapyr
   application, and no vegetation management on arthropod abundance and
   diversity, vegetation response, and the probability of bobwhite chicks
   successfully capturing an arthropod. Bobwhite chicks were more
   successful at capturing arthropods, and arthropod abundance and
   diversity were greatest, in plant communities managed using prescribed
   fire and imazapyr. Forest stands managed using a combination of fire and
   imazapyr were managed primarily to benefit the federally endangered
   red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis; RCW). Our findings suggest
   that management directed toward improving forest condition for RCWs
   improves habitat quality for. brooding bobwhites. However, bobwhite
   chicks in our study area were less successful at capturing arthropods
   than were chicks in other studies in the southeastern United States.
   Brood-earing habitat in pine forests similar to those we studied may be
   of generally poor quality, and could be related to precipitous declines
   of bobwhites in the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Managers should recognize
   that creating high-quality brood habitat in forests similar to those we
   studied will require more intensive management of understory vegetation
   than we studied.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire is influenced by ecological, human and climatic factors.
   Forest fire directly causes biodiversity loss and forest degradation and
   affects global climate change. The present study deals with
   identification of fire-prone areas in Harenna forest using remote
   sensing and GIS techniques. Parameters used for the analysis of the
   forest fire risk susceptibility were physiographic data and proximity
   factors, such as elevation, slope, aspect, vegetation type, proximity to
   settlements and distance from roads. All these parameters have direct
   and or indirect influence on the occurrence of fire. Multi-criteria
   decision-making technique was adopted to derive fire susceptibility map
   of the area. The final output shows forest fire-risk areas of Harenna
   forest in four categories such as very high risk, high risk, moderate
   risk and low risk. An extent of 22,981 ha (3.4 \%) of forest cover in
   the area was of very high risk and 1,59,229 ha (24 \%) was of high risk
   to forest fire. The extents of moderate and low fire-risk areas were
   2,52,327 ha (37.3 \%) and 1022 ha (0.15 \%), respectively. Identity of
   locations of fire-prone areas in advance can be used effectively to plan
   fire control measures in forest and wildlife management areas.}},

Abstract = {{Available habitat within a landscape is often more limited for
   specialist species than for generalists. Therefore, specialists are
   potentially more vulnerable to extinction. The goal of our study was to
   better understand the ephemeral wetland habitat associations of
   specialist and generalist amphibians within a longleaf pine landscape in
   the southeastern United States. We also sought to determine specialist
   (e.g., oak toad {[}Anaxyrus quercicus], Maybee's salamander {[}Ambystoma
   maybeei], pine woods treefrog {[}Hyla femoralis], carpenter frog
   {[}Lithobates virgatipes]) and generalist (e.g., spotted salamander
   {[}Ambystoma maculatum], Cope's gray treefrog {[}Hyla chrysoscelis],
   southern leopard frog {[}Lithobates sphenocephalus]) species' responses
   to specific habitat restoration treatments. From 2005-2010, we examined
   the relationship between aquatic specialist and generalist amphibian
   species occupancy and wetland vegetation structure. We measured
   vegetation and amphibian responses to prescribed fire and vegetation
   mulching (a fire surrogate), plus a combination of mulching and burning.
   Untreated controls were wetlands that had not burned for 4-15 years. We
   combined data from this study and a previous study to elucidate patterns
   in amphibian assemblages in relation to fire history. Specialist
   relative species richness was highest when canopy openness was high and
   leaf litter depth was low, conditions best achieved by mulching plus
   burning. Some specialist species were not detected in wetlands with >8
   years since fire, and some generalist species were not detected in
   wetlands with <2 years since fire, indicating that as vegetation
   structure changes with time since fire, there is a corresponding shift
   in the amphibian assemblage. Important patterns in species distributions
   can be overlooked if relationships to environment and responses to
   habitat change are too generalized and do not account for shifts in
   community composition. For conservation of longleaf pine specialist
   species, we recommend that uplands continue to be prescribed-burned on a
   1-3-year return interval. Burning should occur during the early growing
   season when possible to maximize the probability that wetland basins
   burn. In cases where species of high conservation value are at imminent
   risk of extinction, we recommend a combination of mulching and burning
   to most quickly restore suitable habitat structure. (c) 2016 The

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Human activities are increasing the size, frequency, and severity of
   disturbance across earth's ecosystems induding deserts. Ants are
   important drivers of ecosystem function and are good bioindicators of
   ecosystem sensitivity to disturbance and change. Rodents also play an
   important role in ecosystem response to disturbance and often compete
   with ants for resources. The purpose of our study was to test the main
   and interactive effects of fire, rodent activity, and time on ant
   forager abundance, species richness, and diversity, as well as changes
   in ant mound density and disk area in the Great Basin Desert. We
   experimentally applied burn and rodent exclusion treatments and used
   pitfall traps to collect ants each month from April through October from
   2014 to 2016. Over the three-year period, burned areas had lower
   richness and diversity than unburned areas. Rodent exclusion had minimal
   effects on the ant community, and there was not a significant rodent
   exclusion interaction with fire. Treatment effects varied by month and
   year. The western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidental is, was the
   most abundant ant species, comprising about 70\% of the total ants
   captured. Shifts in ant diversity following fire were driven by positive
   responses of harvester ants to burned habitat conditions. In contrast,
   all other ant species when analyzed together had lower forager abundance
   in burned plots, which drove lower ant diversity in burned plots. Ant
   forager abundance, richness, and diversity increased each year of the
   study in all plots; however, richness and diversity remained lower in
   burned areas than in unburned areas each year. Structural equation
   modeling shows that the effects of fire on ant community diversity are
   partially mediated through the plant community. While rodents affected
   the plant community, those effects do not seem to transfer over to the
   ant community. Pogonomyrmex occidentalis mound density was higher in
   burned areas, but disk area was smaller. Our results suggest that fire
   has adverse effects on ant community diversity. This could have
   long-lasting effects on ecosystem function in the face of a changing
   fire regime in deserts of North America caused by invasive annual
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the processes threatening biodiversity such as habitat
   loss, effective selection of priority conservation areas is required.
   However, reserve selection methods usually ignore the drivers of future
   habitat changes, thus compromising the effectiveness of conservation. In
   this work, we formulated an approach to explicitly quantify the impact
   of fire on conservation areas, considering such disturbance as a driver
   of land-cover changes. The estimated fire impact was integrated as a
   constraint in the reserve selection process to tackle the likely threats
   or opportunities that fire disturbance might cause to the targeted
   species depending on their habitat requirements. In this way, we
   selected conservation areas in a fire-prone Mediterranean region for two
   bird assemblages: forest and open-habitat species. Differences in
   conservation areas selected before and after integrating the impact of
   fire in the reserve selection process were assessed. Integration of fire
   impact for forest species moved preferences towards areas that were less
   prone to burn. However, a larger area was required to achieve the same
   conservation goals. Conversely, integration of fire impacts for
   open-habitat species shifted preferences towards conservation areas in
   locations where the persistence of their required habitat is more likely
   (i.e. shrublands). In other words, we prioritized the conservation of
   not only the current distribution of open-habitat birds, but also the
   disturbance process (i.e. fire) that favours their preferred habitat and
   distributions in the long term. Finally, this work emphasizes the need
   to consider the opposing potential impacts of wildfires on species for
   an effective conservation planning.}},

   carbon stocks: A knowledge synthesis}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{466}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Almost half of the total organic carbon (C) in terrestrial ecosystems is
   stored in forest soils. By altering rates of input or release of C from
   soils, forest management activities can influence soil C stocks in
   forests. In this review, we synthesize current evidence regarding the
   influences of 13 common forest management practices on forest soil C
   stocks. Afforestation of former croplands generally increases soil C
   stocks, whereas on former grasslands and peatlands, soil C stocks are
   unchanged or even reduced following afforestation. The conversion of
   primary forests to secondary forests generally reduces soil C stocks,
   particularly if the land is converted to an agricultural land-use prior
   to reforestation. Harvesting, particularly clear-cut harvesting,
   generally results in a reduction in soil C stocks, particularly in the
   forest floor and upper mineral soil. Removal of residues by harvesting
   whole-trees and stumps negatively affects soil C stocks. Soil
   disturbance from site preparation decreases soil C stocks, particularly
   in the organic top soil, however improved growth of tree seedlings may
   outweigh soil C losses over a rotation. Nitrogen (N) addition has an
   overall positive effect on soil C stocks across a wide range of forest
   ecosystems. Likewise, higher stocks and faster accumulation of soil C
   occur under tree species with N-fixing associates. Stocks and
   accumulation rates of soil C also differ under different tree species,
   with coniferous species accumulating more C in the forest floor and
   broadleaved species tending to store more C in the mineral soil. There
   is some evidence that increased tree species diversity could positively
   affect soil C stocks in temperate and subtropical forests, but tree
   species identity, particularly N-fixing species, seems to have a
   stronger impact on soil C stocks than tree species diversity. Management
   of stand density and thinning have small effects on forest soil C
   stocks. In forests with high populations of ungulate herbivores,
   reduction in herbivory levels can increase soil C stocks. Removal of
   plant biomass for fodder and fuel is related to a reduction in the soil
   C stocks. Fire management practices such as prescribed burning reduce
   soil C stocks, but less so than wildfires which are more intense. For
   each practice, we identify existing gaps in knowledge and suggest
   research to address the gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Large-bodied mammalian herbivores dominated Earth's terrestrial
   ecosystems for several million years before undergoing substantial
   extinctions and declines during the Late Pleistocene (LP) due to
   prehistoric human impacts. The decline of large herbivores led to
   widespread ecological changes due to the loss of their ecological
   functions, as driven by their unique combinations of traits. However,
   recently, humans have significantly increased herbivore species richness
   through introductions in many parts of the world, potentially
   counteracting LP losses. Here, we assessed the extent to which
   introduced herbivore species restore lost-or contribute novel-functions
   relative to preextinction LP assemblages. We constructed
   multidimensional trait spaces using a trait database for all extant and
   extinct mammalian herbivores >= 10 kg known from the earliest LP
   (similar to 130,000 ybp) to the present day. Extinction-driven
   contractions of LP trait space have been offset through introductions by
   similar to 39\% globally. Analysis of trait space overlap reveals that
   assemblages with introduced species are overall more similar to those of
   the LP than native-only assemblages. This is because 64\% of introduced
   species are more similar to extinct rather than extant species within
   their respective continents. Many introduced herbivores restore trait
   combinations that have the capacity to influence ecosystem processes,
   such as wildfire and shrub expansion in drylands. Although introduced
   species have long been a source of contention, our findings indicate
   that they may, in part, restore ecological functions reflective of the
   past several million years before widespread human-driven extinctions.}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The pine forests in the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains are a
   heterogeneous mosaic of disturbance and recovery. The most extensive and
   intensive stress and mortality are received from human activity, fire,
   and mountain pine beetles (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae). Understanding
   disturbance interactions and disturbance-succession pathways are crucial
   for adapting management strategies to mitigate their impacts and
   anticipate future ecosystem change. Driven by this goal, we assessed the
   forest disturbance and recovery history in the Southern Rocky Mountains
   Ecoregion using a 13-year time series of Landsat image stacks. An
   automated classification workflow that integrates temporal segmentation
   techniques and a random forest classifier was used to examine
   disturbance patterns. To enhance efficiency in selecting representative
   samples at the ecoregion scale, a new sampling strategy that takes
   advantage of the scene-overlap among adjacent Landsat images was
   designed. The segment-based assessment revealed that the overall
   accuracy for all 14 scenes varied from 73.6\% to 92.5\%, with a mean of
   83.1\%. A design-based inference indicated the average producer's and
   user's accuracies for MPB mortality were 85.4\% and 82.5\% respectively.
   We found that burn severity was largely unrelated to the severity of
   pre-fire beetle outbreaks in this region, where the severity of
   post-fire beetle outbreaks generally decreased in relation to burn
   severity. Approximately half the clear-cut and burned areas were in
   various stages of recovery, but the regeneration rate was much slower
   for MPB-disturbed sites. Pre-fire beetle outbreaks and subsequent fire
   produced positive compound effects on seedling reestablishment in this
   ecoregion. Taken together, these results emphasize that although
   multiple disturbances do play a role in the resilience mechanism of the
   serotinous lodgepole pine, the overall recovery could be slow due to the
   vast area of beetle mortality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Animals inhabiting disturbance-prone systems, such as the northern

   adapted to certain intensities of disturbance (e.g., frequency, spatial
   extent, seasonality). Management practices attempt to mimic these
   natural conditions. Even though northern bobwhites are known as the
   firebird, most fire-related management is currently based on tradition

   northern bobwhites on private property in Georgetown County, South

   feeding. We radio-tagged 338 individual bobwhites and monitored them 3-4
   times weekly via very high frequency (VHF) telemetry for 2 years. We
   used hierarchical habitat selection functions in a Bayesian framework to
   model the data. We considered 2 spatial scales: the study site

   for small burns during the breeding season but had the highest selection
   for areas intermediately distant fromburn edges during winter (i.e., 67
   m). Bobwhites had the strongest selection for fire return intervals of
   2-3 years during winter but 1-2 years during the breeding season. Use of

Abstract = {{1. Fire is an important disturbance in African savannas where it is
   generally assumed that high levels of pyrodiversity (variation in
   aspects of the fire regime) are necessary to maintain high levels of
   biodiversity. There is, however, little empirical evidence in support of
   this hypothesis for animals. Furthermore, the relationship between
   pyrodiversity and biodiversity may vary with different savanna types,
   shaped by mean annual precipitation.
   2. We made use of a long-term burning experiment to investigate the
   effect of interactions between precipitation and pyrodiversity on
   biodiversity. We sampled termites (major ecosystem engineers in
   savannas) within experimental plots involving a range of fire seasons
   and frequencies. Sampling was conducted in three distinct savanna types
   along a rainfall gradient in South Africa. We explored how termite
   diversity varied with mean annual precipitation and whether faunal
   responses to fire regimes varied with rainfall. Termites were sampled
   comprehensively during the wet season using cellulose baits and active
   searching in order to sample a variety of functional groups.
   3. Assemblages differed significantly across savanna types with higher
   levels of diversity in the wetter site using the active searching
   method. Diversity was lowest at the most arid site but certain feeding
   groups (FGs) peaked in the savanna with intermediate rainfall.
   Differences between these savannas are attributed to broad underlying
   changes in net primary productivity and temperature, with mammalian
   herbivores thought to generate a peak in diversity of some faunal groups
   at the intermediate savanna through their role in facilitating nutrient
   cycling.
   4. Overall, termites were highly resistant to fire in all savanna types
   with little difference between fire regimes (season and frequency), but
   assemblage composition and some FGs were affected by burning.
   Differences between fire regimes were more pronounced with increasing
   rainfall. These differences are likely to be linked to changes in
   vegetation structure caused by fire, which are more significant in wet
   savannas.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings, along with those for other
   insect taxa, indicate limited support for the pyrodiversity-biodiversity
   hypothesis; this suggests that, at least for invertebrates, management
   regimes can be flexible, although more caution is advisable in wetter
   savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Pinon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) removal is a common
   management approach to restore sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) vegetation in
   areas experiencing woodland expansion. Because many management
   treatments are conducted to benefit sagebrush-obligate birds, we
   surveyed bird communities to assess treatment effectiveness in
   establishing sagebrush bird communities at study sites in Utah, Nevada,
   Idaho, and Oregon. Our analyses included data from 1 or 2 yr prior to
   prescribed fire or mechanical treatment and 3 to 5 yr posttreatment. We
   used detrended correspondence analysis to 1) identify primary patterns
   of bird communities surveyed from 2006 to 2011 at point transects, 2)
   estimate ecological scale of change needed to achieve treatment
   objectives from the relative dissimilarity of survey points to the
   ordination region delineating sagebrush bird communities, and 3) measure
   changes in pre- and posttreatment bird communities. Birds associated
   with sagebrush, woodlands, and ecotones were detected on our surveys;
   increased dissimilarity of survey points to the sagebrush bird community
   was characterized by a gradient of increased juniper and decreased
   sagebrush cover. Prescribed fires burned between 30\% and 97\% of our
   bird survey points. However, from 6\% to 24\% cover of pit-ion-juniper
   still remained posttreatment on the four treatment plots. We measured
   only slight changes in bird communities, which responded primarily to
   current vegetation rather than relative amount of change from
   pretreatment vegetation structure. Bird communities at survey points
   located at greater ecological scales from the sagebrush bird community
   changed least and will require more significant impact to achieve
   changes. Sagebrush bird communities were established at only two survey
   points, which were adjacent to a larger sagebrush landscape and
   following almost complete juniper removal by mechanical treatment. Our
   results indicate that management treatments that leave residual woodland
   cover and are not adjacent to extensive sagebrush stands are unlikely to
   establish sagebrush birds.}},

Title = {{More famine than feast: pattern and variation in a potentially
   degenerating mammal fauna on Cape York Peninsula}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{475-487}},
Abstract = {{Context. Global mammal populations continue to be threatened by
   environmental change, and recent decadal monitoring in northern
   Australia suggests a collapse in mammal abundance in key locations. Cape
   York Peninsula has globally significant natural values but there is very
   little published about the status and distribution of mammals in this
   region.
   Aims. Following an extensive field survey we investigated two key
   questions: (i) what is the composition, spatial variation and change
   from previous regional surveys in the mid to late 1900s in the native
   terrestrial and arboreal mammal fauna recorded; and (ii) which landscape
   and site factors best predict mammal richness and abundance.
   Methods. We sampled 202 one-hectare sites across seven locations from
   2009 to 2012 in woodlands, closed forestand dune scrub and tussock
   grasslands. We collected landscape and site-based environmental data for
   each location, representing fire, weather and vegetation factors. We
   used generalised linear mixed models to examine the relationship between
   mammals and these factors.
   Key results. Mammals were generally scarce across the sites and were
   more abundant and species rich in wet coastal grasslands or closed
   forests then tropical savanna woodlands. Fire frequency data and the
   surrounding vegetation complexity were consistent landscape-scale
   predictors of mammals; ground cover and woody complexity were
   significant at the site scale.
   Conclusions. Notwithstanding interpretational constraints related to the
   limited evidence base of historic sampling, the mammal fauna recorded in
   this study for Cape York Peninsula was similar in composition to the
   mammal fauna described from 1948-1980 and surveys in 1985, with some
   species seemingly declining (e.g. Melomys burtoni, Dasyurus hallucatus,
   Sminthopsis virginiae) and others stable (e.g. Rattus sordidus) or more
   common (e.g. Rattus tunneyi); however, across all sites abundance was
   low, and many sites had few or no mammals.
   Implications. In the absence of consistent long-term systematic
   monitoring it is difficult to determine if this survey and historical
   surveys represent pre-European patterns for mammals. The absence or low
   abundance of mammals in most sites suggest that cotemporary patterns may
   not represent an intact mammal fauna. Due to the equivocal nature of
   these findings a critical next step is to establish robust monitoring
   and experimental work to reveal the response of mammals to management
   interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Rangeland and pastures comprise about 42\% of the total land area of the
   United States. About three-quarters of all domestic livestock depend
   upon grazing lands for survival. Many ranges have had domestic stock
   grazing for more than 100 years and, as a result, the plant composition
   has changed greatly from the original ecosystems. Western rangelands
   previously dominated by perennial bunchgrasses have been converted,
   primarily through overgrazing, to annual grasslands that are susceptible
   to invasion by introduced dicots. Today there are more than 300
   rangeland weeds in the United States. Some of the most problematic
   include Bromus tectorum, Euphorbia esula, Centaurea solstitialis, C.
   diffusa, C. maculosa, and a number of other Centaurea species. In total,
   weeds in rangeland cause an estimated loss of \$2 billion annually in
   the United States, which is more than all other pests combined. They
   impact the livestock industry by lowering yield and quality of forage,
   interfering with grazing, poisoning animals, increasing costs of
   managing and producing livestock, and reducing land value. They also
   impact wildlife habitat and forage, deplete soil and water resources,
   and reduce plant and animal diversity. Numerous mechanical and cultural
   control options have been developed to manage noxious rangeland weeds,
   including mowing, prescribed burning, timely grazing, and perennial
   grass reseeding or interseeding. In addition, several herbicides are
   registered for use on rangelands and most biological control programs
   focus on noxious rangeland weed control. Successful management of
   noxious weeds on rangeland will require the development of a long-term
   strategic plan incorporating prevention programs, education materials
   and activities, and economical and sustainable multi-year integrated
   approaches that improve degraded rangeland communities, enhance the
   utility of the ecosystem, and prevent reinvasion or encroachment by
   other noxious weed species.}},

Abstract = {{Forest-dwelling bats often use snags and live trees as maternity and
   bachelor roost sites. These roost sites can be destroyed or altered by
   natural events (e.g., wildfire) or forest management activities (e.g.,
   prescribed fire, thinning, harvesting). To determine whether artificial
   roost structures could supplement natural roost sites, we tested 2 types
   of artificial structures for use by bats: resin (n = 10) and wood (n=
   10) roosts. Artificial roosts were placed on snags in 6 ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) stands and compared with use of nearby natural roost
   snags (n= 10). We monitored the 3 roost types (resin, wood, natural)
   approximately every 2 weeks for use by bats for 2 summers (1999 and
   2000). Over the 2-yr period, bats used 17 of 20 artificial roosts (8
   resin and 9 wood), using both artificial roost types in about equal
   proportions, Bats used 5 of the 10 natural snags monitored. Resin roosts
   were camouflaged to match tree bark, have a >20-year lifespan, and cost
   US \$42 each after construction of a \$250 mold. They can be designed to
   resemble any tree species. Wood roosts cost about \$5 each, were more
   visible, and likely have a shorter lifespan than resin roosts. Both
   roost types might require some annual maintenance (recaulking tops and
   edges). Maintaining and managing for natural roosts should be a priority
   for resource managers since artificial roosts might not provide the same
   micro-climate as natural roosts. However, artificial roosts might be
   useful temporary habitat under site-specific conditions. Artificial
   roosts could also be useful as research tools.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fires are used to manipulate and manage rangelands, but
   effective monitoring techniques are needed to ensure that management
   goals and objectives are being met. The application of an effective fire
   program on rangelands is not a simple task. Overgrazing by livestock
   since the early development of the livestock industry has altered the
   vegetative complex on most rangelands with an increase in woody plants.
   Because of its relatively low cost, prescribed fire, both cool and warm
   season, are sustainable practices if proper grazing management is part
   of the management scheme. Grazing management and prescribed fire have
   often been treated as separate issues by rangeland managers; however,
   development and application of an effective prescribed burning program
   requires an understanding of the relationship between fire and grazing.
   Ranchers need fuel (grass) to burn and they also need income from
   livestock, which requires forage (grass, a major part of forage). In the
   short-term, fire reduces carrying capacity for livestock but, in the
   long-term, fire increases grass production, resulting in increased
   carrying capacity. Therefore, some monitoring technique is needed that
   will allow the manager to budget grass for both fuel and forage. The
   Grazing Manager (TGM) is a software program that projects both forage
   production (expressed as animal unit days) and, animal demand (expressed
   as animal unit days) for each forage year. TGM has been successfully
   used on the Texas A\&M University Research Station at Sonora as a tool

Abstract = {{Using long-term direct observations in a Polytrichum Myrtillus pine
   forest, we have constructed and verified a homogeneous Markov chain
   model for two dominant species (Vaccinium myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea)
   at the late stages of succession. The sampling design features a large
   sample size (2000 quadrats) on permanent transects, several
   re-examinations with the interval of 5 years, and the use of species
   rooted frequency. As a model of the process under concern, the discrete
   Markov chain accounts for the following four states: both species being
   absent on the quadrat, one of them being present alone, and the joint
   presence of the both; the model time step coincides with the time
   interval between observations. The model is calibrated on the data of
   two successive examinations and verified on that of one more
   examination.
   All possible transitions between the states are revealed to realize in
   quadrats for one time interval, as well as the absence of transitions at
   each state, which results in the complete digraph (directed graph) of
   transitions. Major model results are obtained by the formulae of finite
   Markov chain theory: the steady-state square distribution, cyclicity
   characteristics, and the mean durations of stages in the fine-scale
   dynamics. As a steady-state (stable) outcome of succession, the
   distribution among quadrats is expected where 30\% of quadrats are
   occupied by V. myrtillus alone, 11\% by V. vitis-idaea alone, both
   species are present on 18\% of quadrats, and 41\% of quadrats are
   `empty'. This demonstrates a possibility for V. myrtillus and V.
   vitis-idaea to coexist stably at the latest stages of succession, with
   the clear predominance of V. myrtillus, yet without competitive
   exclusion. The quantitative characteristics of cyclicity and the
   durations of stages in the fine-scale dynamics enable us to estimate the
   total duration of secondary post-fire succession as about 45 years (to
   reach a distribution of states that differs less than 5\% from the
   steady-state one). Out of the four states specified, the quadrats with
   V. vitis-idaea alone persist for the least time (8 years) on the
   average, while `empty' ones persist for the greatest time (18 years).
   Forecasting the dynamics for one model time step forward and comparing
   the forecast with the real square distribution have revealed the measure
   of difference to be 5.4\%. This illustrates the efficiency of the
   (time-)homogeneous Markov chain as a short-term forecast tool, yet
   leaves open the question whether the homogeneity hypothesis be true in
   the longer term.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The >2,570,000-ha Flint Hills ecoregion of Kansas, USA, harbors the
   largest remaining contiguous tract of tallgrass prairie in North
   America, a unique system, as the remainder of North America's tallgrass
   prairie has succumbed to development and conversion. Consequently, the
   loss and degradation of tallgrass prairie has reduced populations of
   many North American prairie-obligate species including the regal
   fritillary (Speyeria idalia) butterfly. Population abundance and
   occupied range of regal fritillary have declined >99\%, restricting many
   populations to isolated, remnant patches of tallgrass prairie. Such
   extensive decline has resulted in consideration of the regal fritillary
   for protection under the Endangered Species Act. Although it is widely
   accepted that management practices such as fire, grazing, and haying are
   necessary to maintain prairie ecosystems, reported responses by regal
   fritillary to these management regimes have been ambiguous. We tested
   effects of prescribed fire across short, moderate, and long fire-return
   intervals as well as grazing and haying management treatments on regal
   fritillary density. We also tested the relative influence of habitat
   characteristics created by these management regimes by measuring density
   of an obligate host plant (Viola spp.) and canopy cover of woody
   vegetation, grasses, forbs/ferns, bare ground, and litter. We found
   density was at least 1.6 times greater in sites burned with a moderate
   fire-return interval vs. sites burned with short and long fire-return
   intervals. Overall management regardless of fire-return interval did not
   have an effect on density. Percent cover of grass had the strongest
   positive association, while percent cover of woody vegetation had the
   greatest negative effect on density. Our results indicate that
   patch-burning is a viable and perhaps even ideal management strategy for
   regal fritillary in tallgrass prairie landscapes. Additionally, these
   results elucidate the importance of fire, particularly when applied at
   moderate-return intervals to regal fritillary, and corroborate a growing
   suite of studies that suggest fire is perhaps not as detrimental to
   populations of regal fritillary as previously believed.}},

Abstract = {{The Tool for Exploratory Landscape Scenario Analyses (TELSA) is a
   spatially explicit model of vegetation succession, natural disturbances,
   and forest management activities. TELSA is a strategic planning tool
   designed to support adaptive management by projecting the consequences
   of alternative scenarios at the scale of landscape units (i.e. 10
   000-200 000 ha) over time frames of decades to centuries. Scenario
   combine user-specified assumptions about natural disturbances and
   management activities, and can include `no action' or historic
   disturbance scenarios. The simulation model is at the core of a set of
   tools that also includes a geographic information system, databases, and
   several user interfaces for scenario definition, data analysis, spatial
   analysis and the display of results. Spatial characteristics of
   landscapes, such as fragmentation, patch-size distribution and
   connectivity are largely determined by management actions and their
   interaction with natural disturbances. The TELSA toolbox includes a tool
   for the automated design of management units (i.e. harvest cutblocks),
   based on user-defined criteria and scenario objectives. TELSA easily
   evaluates strategic alternatives regarding the size range of management
   units, their spatial aggregation, the use of adjacency constraints, and
   the application of different silvicultural systems. TELSA represents
   vegetation succession as changes in species composition and structural
   stages of stands, thus projecting landscape conditions in a format that
   is relevant for the analysis of wildlife habitat and many other resource
   indicators. Succession pathway diagrams define the transition times
   between successional classes and, for each class, the probabilities and
   impacts of disturbance by insects, fire or other agents. These diagrams
   also define the impacts of management actions on stand structure and
   vegetation composition. Diagrams can be defined for forests and other
   vegetation types such as shrub and rangelands. Wildfires and other
   natural disturbance events that affect vegetation dynamics are
   inherently unpredictable. The model can use multiple stochastic
   simulations of each scenario to provide estimates of the mean, range and
   variability of selected performance indicators. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The two major forms of disturbance in the montane ash eucalypt forests
   of the Central Highlands of Victoria (southeastern Australia) are
   clearfell logging and unplanned wildfires. Since the 1930s wildfire has
   been followed by intensive and extensive salvage-logging operations,
   which may proceed for many years after a wildfire has occurred. Although
   applied widely, the potential effects of salvage logging on native flora
   and fauna have been poorly studied. Our data indicate that the abundance
   of large trees with hollows is significantly reduced in forests subject
   to salvage harvesting. This has implications for the persistence of an
   array of such cavity-using vertebrates as the endangered arboreal
   marsupial, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelidues leadbeateri). Salvage
   logging also reduces the prevalence of multiaged montane ash
   forests-places that typically support the highest diversity of arboreal
   marsupials and forest birds. Limited research has been conducted on the
   effects of salvage logging on plants; thus, we constructed hypotheses
   about potential impacts for further testing based on known responses to
   clearfell logging and key life history attributes. We predict many
   species, such as vegetatively resprouting tree ferns, will decline, as
   they do after clearfelling. We also suggest that seed regenerators,
   which typically regenerate well after fire or conventional clearfelling,
   will decline after salvage logging because the stimulation for
   germination (fire) takes place prior to mechanical disturbance
   (logging). Understory plant communities in salvage-logged areas will be
   dominated by a smaller suite of species, and those that are wind
   dispersed, have viable soil-stored seed remaining after salvage logging,
   or have deep rhizomes are likely to be advantaged. We recommend the
   following improvements to salvage-logging policies that may better
   incorporate conservation needs in Victorian montane ash forests: (1)
   exemption of salvage logging from some areas (e.g., old-growth stands
   and places subject to only partial stand damage); (2) increased
   retention of biological legacies on burned areas through variations in
   the intensity of salvage logging; and (3) reduction in the levels of
   physical disturbance on salvage-logged areas, especially through limited
   seedbed preparation and mechanical disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent fires arc essential for maintaining the Longleaf Pine (Pima
   palustris) ecosystem and arc beneficial to the Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus
   polyphemus), a Longleaf Pine specialist that excavates burrows used by
   many commensal species. Presumably, burrows offer important refugia to
   commensals both during and after fires, but no published studies have
   confirmed this. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine
   how prescribed fire influences diurnal vertebrate use of Gopher Tortoise
   burrows. We deployed trail cameras in 46 burrows before a prescribed
   lire and monitored vertebrate activity until we removed cameras 11 d
   after the fire. We compared vertebrate burrow use before and during the
   prescribed fire and also used data from a previous study to compare
   vertebrate use of burrows on an unburned site to that of our recently
   burned site. We observed one vertebrate commensal at 43 monitored
   burrows (0.02 vertebrates per camera) on the day before the burn and
   nine vertebrates at 41 burrows (eight species, 0.22 vertebrates per
   camera) during the burn. In addition, we observed 8.5 times more
   vertebrates using burrows at the recently burned site than at an
   unburned site (51 individuals of seven species versus six individuals of
   three species, respectively). Our results suggest that Gopher Tortoise
   burrows offer important diurnal refugia to commensals from direct (risk
   of mortality) and indirect (perceived risk of predation and/or injury)
   effects of fire. Additional studies would be beneficial on nocturnal
   vertebrate burrow use, longer-term trends as vegetative cover
   regenerates following fire, and relative importance of other refugia for
   vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Managing ecosystems for resilience and sustainability requires
   understanding how they will respond to future anthropogenic drivers such
   as climate change and urbanization. In fire-dependent ecosystems,
   predicting this response requires a focus on how these drivers will
   impact fire regimes. Here, we use scenarios of climate change,
   urbanization and management to simulate the future dynamics of the
   critically endangered and fire-dependent longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
   ecosystem. We investigated how climate change and urbanization will
   affect the ecosystem, and whether the two conservation goals of a 135\%
   increase in total longleaf area and a doubling of fire-maintained
   open-canopy habitat can be achieved in the face of these drivers. Our
   results show that while climatic warming had little effect on the
   wildfire regime, and thus on longleaf pine dynamics, urban growth led to
   an 8\% reduction in annual wildfire area. The management scenarios we
   tested increase the ecosystem's total extent by up to 62\% and result in
   expansion of open-canopy longleaf by as much as 216\%, meeting one of
   the two conservation goals for the ecosystem. We find that both
   conservation goals for this ecosystem, which is climate-resilient but
   vulnerable to urbanization, are only attainable if a greater focus is
   placed on restoration of non-longleaf areas as opposed to maintaining
   existing longleaf stands. Our approach demonstrates the importance of
   accounting for multiple relevant anthropogenic threats in an
   ecosystem-specific context in order to facilitate more effective
   management actions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past century, ponderosa pine-dominated landscapes of the
   southwestern United States have been altered by human activities such as
   grazing, timber harvest, road building, and fire exclusion. Most
   forested areas within these landscapes now show increased susceptibility
   to stand-replacing fires, insect outbreaks, and drought-related
   mortality. Recent large wildfires in the region have spurred public
   interest in large-scale fuel reduction and restoration programs, which
   create perceived and real conflicts with the conservation of
   biodiversity. Conservation concerns include the potential for larger
   road networks, soil and understory disturbance, exotic plant invasion,
   and the removal of large trees in treated areas. Pursuing prescribed
   burning, thinning, or other treatments on the broad scale that many
   scientists and managers envision requires the reconciliation of
   ecological restoration with biodiversity conservation. This study
   presents recommendations from a workshop for integrating the principles
   and practices of restoration ecology and conservation biology, toward
   the objective of restoring the composition, structure, and function of
   dry ponderosa pine forests. Planning on the scale of hundreds of
   thousands of hectares offers opportunities to achieve multiple
   objectives (e.g., rare species protection and restoration of ecological
   structures and processes) that cannot easily be addressed on a
   site-by-site basis. However, restoration must be coordinated with
   conservation planning to achieve mutual objectives and should include
   strict guidelines for protection of rare, declining, and sensitive
   habitats and species.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is frequently used as a management tool to reduce the cover of
   weeds, to reduce the amount of fuel available for future fires, and to
   create succession mosaics that may enhance biodiversity. Wedetermined
   the influence of fire on wildlife, by quantifying reptile assemblage
   composition in response to fire in a weedy environment characterised by
   very short-term fire return intervals (< 2 years). We used reptiles
   because they are often understudied, and are only moderately vagile
   compared to other vertebrates, and they respond strongly to changes in
   vegetation structure. We repeatedly sampled 24 replicate sampling sites
   after they had been unburned for two years, just prior to burning
   (preburnt), just after burning (post-burnt), and up to 15 months after
   burning (revegetated) and monitored vegetation structure and reptile
   richness, abundance and assemblage composition. Our sites were not
   spatially auto-correlated, and were covered by native kangaroo grass
   (Themeda triandra), black spear grass (Heteropogon contortus), or an
   invasive weed (grader grass, Themeda quadrivalvis). Reptile abundance
   and richness were highest when sites had been unburned for 2 years, and
   greatly reduced in all areas post burning. The lowest reptile abundances
   occurred in sites dominated by the weed. Reptile abundance and richness
   had recovered in all grass types 15 months after burning, but assemblage
   composition changed. Some species were present only in before our focus
   fire in native grass, and their populations did not recover even 15
   months post-burning. Even in fireprone, often-burnt habitats such as our
   study sites, in which faunal richness and abundance were not strongly
   influenced by fire, reptile assemblage composition was altered. To
   maintain faunal biodiversity in fire-prone systems, we suggest reducing
   the frequency of prescribed fires, and (if possible) excluding fire from
   weedy invasions if it allows native grasses to return. (C) 2016 The

   compared bird communities of sand pine scrub in mature forest and three
   disturbance treatments (1) high-intensity wildfire, salvage logged, and
   naturally regenerated, (2) clearcut, roller chopped, and broadcast
   seeded, and (3) clearcut and bracke-seeded. We analyzed communities
   based on residency status and nesting guilds. Migatory breeding birds
   were nearly restricted to mature forest. Bird communities of mature
   forest were significantly more species rich and diverse than those of
   disturbance treatments in spring. However, species richness and
   diversity of migratory winter residents did not differ among treatments,
   indicating that they are habitat-structure generalists on their
   wintering grounds. Canopy- and cavity-nesters and canopy- and
   bark-foraging species were virtually restricted to mature forest. Most
   species recorded in mature sand pine forest or disturbance treatments
   were either habitat-structure generalists or also occurred in other
   similarly structured vegetation types. However, the threatened and
   endemic Florida Scrub Jay (Aphelocoma c. coerulescens) occurred only in
   disturbance treatments (no differences). Silvicultural disturbance
   appears to mimic the natural high-intensity disturbance regime by
   creating habitat structural features required by open scrub species and
   may be an important habitat management tool where the use of wildfire is
   impractical. However, long-term effects, unsalvaged burns, and landscape
   patterns created by clearcutting were not addressed and may also be
   important in structuring bird communities of sand pine scrub.}},

Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{West European heathlands are often of high conservation value, but
   throughout the region their area has declined steeply in recent years.
   Heath is a semi-natural vegetation type, owing its origins and
   maintenance to human use and management. In addition to direct
   destruction of heathland and its habitats, loss has resulted from
   abandonment of traditional management practices followed by successional
   change to other vegetation types (e. g. woodland, scrub, Pteridium
   aqudinum, grassland). To illustrate some of the ecological effects of
   management, five kinds of traditional practice arc reviewed: grazing,
   controlled burning, cutting, turf stripping or sod cutting ('turbary',
   `plaggen' etc.) and periodic cultivation. A feature common to all is the
   continuous or periodic depletion of the nutrient fund contained in the
   system, or at least prevention of nutrient accumulation. Abandonment of
   management permits accumulation, which may be increased by inputs from
   polluted rainfall. In addition, traditional practices (apart from
   grazing) have tended to create dense, even-aged stands of Calluna
   vulgaris (or other Ericaccous species).
   A return to traditional management will secure the conservation of
   heathland landscapes. But nature conservation in heathland requires not
   only maintenance of the typical physiognomy, but also full
   representation of characteristic plant and animal communities, and
   creation of structural heterogeneity and horizontal mosaic. To some
   extent careful management of grazing animals may achieve these aims, but
   this is often difficult to achieve in practice. It may be necessary to
   have recourse to cutting, burning or turf-stripping, with modifications
   to allow application on a small-patch basis. This will produce a mosaic
   of stands of varying age. Frequency of treatment can be varied to
   provide opportunities for pioneer species as well as those of mature or
   degenerate stands. Certain elements of the flora or fauna may require
   special measures.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is regarded as a natural ecological factor of the environment that
   has been occurring since time immemorial in savannas and grasslands on
   the continent of Africa. The African continent is highly prone to
   lightning storms and has an ideal fire climate with dry and wet periods.
   It also has the most extensive area of tropical savanna on the earth,
   characterized by a grassy understory that becomes extremely flammable
   during the dry season. The use of fire in the management of vegetation
   for both domestic livestock systems and wildlife is widely recognized.
   Research on the effects of fire has been conducted throughout the
   grasslands and savannas of Africa since the early 20(th) century, and
   has focused on the effects of season and frequency of burning on forage
   production potential of the grass sward and the ratio of bush to grass
   in African savannas. In 1971, a conference was held in the United States
   by Tall Timbers Research Station in Tallahassee, Florida, on the theme
   ``Fire in Africa.'' This congress was attended by fire ecologists from
   throughout Africa. A major benefit that accrued from this meeting was
   the realization that in Africa the study of fire behavior and its
   effects on the ecosystem, as described by type and intensity of fire,
   had been largely ignored in the fire research. This led to recognition
   that the effects of fire must include the effects of all the components
   of the fire regime on the ecosystem, viz., the type and intensity of
   fire and the season and frequency of burning. As a consequence, a
   research program was initiated in South Africa in 1972, and later
   extended to East Africa in 1992, to characterize the behavior of fires
   burning in savanna and grassland vegetation and to determine the effect
   of type and intensity of fire on the vegetation. This research program
   has successfully developed a greater understanding of the effects of
   type and intensity of fire in African grasslands and savannas. This in
   turn led to the development of more effective and practical guidelines
   for fire regimes to be used in controlled burning for domestic livestock
   and wildlife management systems in grasslands and savannas. Research on
   the fire ecology of grasslands and savannas continues to draw scientific
   attention in Africa, and currently there are active research programs
   being conducted in the Eastern Cape Province, KwaZulu-Natal Province,
   and Kruger National Park in South Africa, and in the Ngorongoro Crater
   in Tanzania.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Basin of the western USA is an arid region characterized by
   high spatial and temporal variability. The region experienced high
   levels of ecological disturbance during the early period of
   Euro-American settlement, especially from about 1870-1935. The principal
   plant communities of the Great Basin are sagebrush steppes, dominated by
   various Artemisia shrubs and perennial bunchgrasses that represent the
   largest rangeland ecosystem in North America. In low to mid-elevation
   sagebrush communities, exotic annual grasses have displaced native plant
   species and are associated with a dramatic increase in size and
   frequency of wildfires. Degradation in this region is driven by
   processes that cause the loss of mature bunchgrasses, which, when
   intact, limit exotic annual grass invasion. Historically, large economic
   investments to restore degraded Great Basin rangeland through
   establishment of native bunchgrasses, principally utilizing heavily
   mechanized agronomic approaches, have been met with limited success. A
   multitude of environmental factors contribute to the lack of restoration
   success in this region, but seedling mortality from freezing and drought
   has been identified as a primary demographic limitation to successful
   bunchgrass establishment. Novel approaches to overcoming limitations to
   bunchgrass establishment will be required for restoration success.
   Increased national concern and a near listing of the greater
   sage-grouse, a steppe-obligate species, to Endangered Species status,
   has spurred greater regional support and collaboration across a
   diversity of stakeholder groups such as state and federal land and
   wildlife management agencies, county planners, and ranchers.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination by insects in forests is an extremely important process that
   should be conserved. Not only do pollinating insects help to maintain a
   diversity of plants within forests, but they also aid in pollinating
   crops found near forested land. Currently, the effects of various forest
   management practices on floral visiting insect abundance or diversity is
   unknown, so we investigated how prescribed burning, mechanical shrub
   control, and combination of the two affected abundance of floral
   visiting insects. We caught 7921 floral visitors from four orders and 21
   families. Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with
   Halictidae being the most abundant family A total of 45 species of
   Hymenoptera representing six families were captured. We caught seven
   families and 35 species of Lepidoptera, six families and 33 species of
   Coleoptera, and two families and 13 species of Diptera. Most floral
   visitors were captured in the mechanical shrub control plus prescribed
   burn treatments, while lower numbers were caught on the mechanical shrub
   control only, prescribed burn only and control treatments. Overall
   species richness was also higher on mechanical plus burn treatments.
   Total pollinator abundance and the abundance of most orders and families
   was correlated with decreased tree basal area and increased percent
   herbaceous plant cover. Our study shows that floral visitors increased
   in abundance and species richness most from forest disturbance that
   reduced the density of overstory trees and increased the amount of
   herbaceous plant growth. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   often discarded due to high rates of seed predation. Predator activity
   can be modified by habitat complexity due to its effects on
   accessibility and protection for different predators. In this study we
   analysed how habitat complexity generated by different post-fire
   management treatments, sowing depth, and capsaicin (a chemical
   repellent) affect acorn predation by two guilds of post-dispersal
   predators that differ in size and foraging behaviour. We carried out two
   acorn predation experiments. In Experiment \#1 we buried acorns at two
   depths (2 and 8 cm) in two post-fire burnt-wood management treatments of
   different habitat complexity, namely: (1) Salvage Logging (SL), where
   the burnt trunks were cut and piled and the branches were masticated
   (lower habitat complexity), and (2) Non-Intervention (NI), with no
   action after the fire and 100\% of the trees naturally fallen by 2009,
   thus leaving a habitat with lying burnt logs and branches (higher
   habitat complexity). In Experiment \#2 we repeated Experiment \#1, with
   the addition of capsaicin as a mammal repellent treatment. Most acorns
   were consumed in both years (ca. 90\%), mainly by rodents. In Experiment
   \#1 predation by boars accounted for 4.1\% of overall predation, and it
   was about twice as high in SL than in NI, likely due to the physical
   difficulty for large mammals to forage in an area with a complex
   structure created by lying logs and branches. In contrast, rodents
   consumed ca. 1.4 times more acorns in NI than in SL, which led to
   overall greater predation in NI in both experiments. This was likely due
   to the protection provided by the branches for the rodent community.
   Deeper burial reduced predation by small percentages, although in
   Experiment \#1 it had a negligible effect in NI. Capsaicin did not
   reduce predation, and it reduced seedling emergence to half. This study
   suggests that habitat complexity created by trunks and branches reduced
   predation by wild boars, but favoured rodent acorn predation. We
   conclude that other methods for the protection of individual acorns need
   to be identified to increase the success of oak reforestation via
   seeding. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bontebok National Park was established to protect the bontebok from

   ungulates compete for recently burnt veld. This work, however, was done
   at a relatively broad scale, while we used counts of bontebok and
   mountain zebra dung groups to assess the habitat use of these ungulates
   at a finer scale. In our analysis we stratified the study area according
   to vegetation type, veld age and fire history. Our results suggest that
   bontebok are more closely associated with burnt veld than mountain zebra
   and that both favour the Drainage Line and Kraal Lawn vegetation types
   over the other vegetation types in the park. The importance of these
   vegetation types has previously been overlooked and should be included
   in future monitoring of herbivore habitat use.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling and assessing the factors that drive forest fire ignitions is
   critical for fire prevention and sustainable ecosystem management. In
   southern Europe, the anthropogenic component of wildland fire ignitions
   is especially relevant. In the Alps, however, the role of fire as a
   component of disturbance regimes in forest and grassland ecosystems is
   poorly known. The aim of this work is to model the probability of fire
   ignition for an Alpine region in Italy using a regional wildfire archive
   (1995-2009) and MaxEnt modeling. We analyzed separately (i) winter
   forest fires, (ii) winter fires on grasslands and fallow land, and (iii)
   summer fires. Predictors were related to morphology, climate, and land
   use; distance from infrastructures, number of farms, and number of
   grazing animals were used as proxies for the anthropogenic component.
   Collinearity among predictors was reduced by a principal component
   analysis. Regarding ignitions, 30\% occurred in agricultural areas and
   24\% in forests. Ignitions peaked in the late winter-early spring.
   Negligence from agrosilvicultural activities was the main cause of
   ignition (64 \%); lightning accounted for 9\% of causes across the study
   time frame, but increased from 6 to 10\% between the first and second
   period of analysis. Models for all groups of fire had a high goodness of
   fit (AUC 0.90-0.95). Temperature was proportional to the probability of
   ignition, and precipitation was inversely proportional. Proximity from
   infrastructures had an effect only on winter fires, while the density of
   grazing animals had a remarkably different effect on summer (positive
   correlation) and winter (negative) fires. Implications are discussed
   regarding climate change, fire regime changes, and silvicultural
   prevention. Such a spatially explicit approach allows us to carry out
   spatially targeted fire management strategies and may assist in
   developing better fire management plans.}},

Abstract = {{A single fall-season prescribed bunt and two consecutive fall-season
   prescribed bums were conducted in 1988 and 1989 to quantify the effects
   of fire intensity and frequency on woody species in two Willamette
   Valley wet prairies. Fuel biomass, fuel properties, fire behavior,
   biomass consumption, and changes in woody species density and height
   were documented before and after the bums. Before burning, Rosa nutkana
   (Nootka rose) was the most abundant woody species at both sites. In
   1988, burns were significantly more intense, produced more heat per unit
   area at Fisher Butte than at Rose Prairie, and were fairly complete,
   with 37\% and 35\% woody biomass consumption, respectively. In 1989,
   burns were spotty; only 11\% of woody biomass was consumed at Fisher
   Butte. The one-burn treatment did not affect R. nutkana density in 1 x
   15 m transects at either site; the two-burn treatment significantly
   increased its density in three of the five communities sampled. Burning
   significantly reduced height growth by eliminating taller individuals
   while stimulating sprouts from belowground tissues. Redistribution of R.
   nutkana and trees into shorter height classes indicates the possibility
   of reducing the visual dominance of woody species if periodic bunts were
   conducted in native Willamette Valley prairie. The low-intensity bums in
   this study were sufficient to remove the woody shoots under 3 m tall but
   did not reduce their capacity to regenerate and did not reduce the
   density of woody species. After decades of fire suppression, two bums
   were not sufficient to reestablish the desired balance between native
   herbaceous and woody species or to reduce the presence of introduced
   woody species. A long-term commitment to the reintroduction of fire as a
   management tool will be required to maintain native wetland prairies in
   the Willamette Valley.}},

Abstract = {{Thinning and burning forests established on revegetated mine pits in
   jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forests of south-west Australia is being
   considered as a management option to accelerate succession in sites with
   excessive tree densities. To assess the impact of thinning and burning
   on reptiles and small mammals, we installed trapping grids in eight
   thinned and burned sites, each paired with untreated controls. Of the
   eight pairs, four were in rehabilitated sites (planted with nonlocal
   species) and four were in restored sites (seeded with local species).
   Thinning and burning had no significant impact on the small mammal
   community, although Cercatetus concinnus was more abundant in
   rehabilitated sites. In contrast, thinning and burning significantly
   increased reptile abundance and species richness, with two species
   (Morethia obscura and Menetia greyii) only recorded in thinned and
   burned sites. We concluded that thinning and burning was a successful
   management option in revegetated mine pits in jarrah forests,
   particularly because reptile communities created by thinning and burning
   were more similar to those in unmined forest. Although published studies
   for comparison are few, we expect thinning and burning to have generally
   positive effects on reptile communities in forest ecosystems where fire
   is an important disturbance agent. Our study emphasizes the importance
   of monitoring revegetated areas over time periods sufficient to detect
   deviations from desired successional trajectories, so that management
   options, such as thinning and burning, can be implemented if required.}},

Abstract = {{A Northern Grazing Systems (NGS) project is identifying and promoting
   key management practices to help improve the profitability and
   sustainability of the extensive beef industry of northern Australia. The
   project's initial focus was management practices that perform best under
   current climate, but now the emphasis has turned to exploring the role
   these practices may play in helping beef producers adapt to changing
   climate. This paper reports the preliminary results of using a
   bio-economic modelling (BEM) framework to compare the performance of a
   range of pasture management practices under current climate and two
   projections of future climate.
   The BEM framework used was linked variants of the GRASP pasture growth
   model and the ENTERPRISE beef herd economic model. The main metric used
   to compare management practices was average annual profit. Management
   practices were compared on a representative beef grazing property
   located near the township of Mitchell, in southwestern Queensland. It
   has around 1,400 breeders on 17,000 ha of native and improved pasture,
   and sells weaner steers, surplus heifers and cull breeding cows at local
   sale yards.
   A flexible stocking rate practice, allowing up to 20\% increases and
   40\% decreases in stocking rate over 25 years in response to variability
   in annual forage availability, was compared with fixed stocking rates. A
   wet season pasture rest for six months once every four years was
   compared with continuous grazing, and a prescribed fire scheduled to
   occur every four years was compared with no burning. These management
   practices were simulated over the last 25 years (1986 to 2010) of
   current climate at Mitchell, and two projections of climate change.
   Projections of climate change, representing the range of possible
   changes in climate, were: 1) a similar to 3 degrees C increase in
   minimum and maximum temperatures and a marginal (1\%) decrease in
   rainfall; and 2) a similar to 3 degrees C increase in temperatures
   combined with a 27\% reduction in rainfall.
   The flexible stocking rate practice performed better than fixed stocking
   rate under current climate. While fixed stocking was sustainable and
   profitable, in current climate, flexible stocking was able to improve
   and maintain pasture condition, enabling carrying capacity, annual
   stocking rates and livestock productivity to increase. Under projected
   climate change, the modelled carrying capacity of the representative
   beef property was lower, especially under Projected Climate 2. Fixed
   stocking rates that were appropriate under current climate were too high
   under the two projections of climate change. Pasture condition and
   livestock productivity declined markedly, leading to low or negative
   average annual profit. The flexible stocking rate practice was able to
   match stocking rates to declining feed availability and carrying
   capacity, and therefore adapt the property to Projected Climate 1.
   However, it was not responsive enough to match stocking rates with the
   more severe reductions in carrying capacity that occurred with Projected
   Climate 2. Annual stocking rates were too high, resulting in poor
   pasture condition and low livestock productivity.
   Under current climate, wet season pasture resting enabled pasture
   condition to improve, leading to increases in carrying capacity, annual
   stocking rates, livestock productivity and profit, compared with
   continuous grazing. Prescribed fire, compared to no burning, prevented
   increases in woody regrowth that reduced carrying capacity, and was
   better able to maintain pasture and livestock productivity. Pasture
   resting and prescribed fire were partially successful in mitigating the
   impacts associated with the lower carrying capacity of Projected Climate
   1, but were ineffective under Projected Climate 2 with its even lower
   carrying capacities where high stocking rates were the dominant
   influence on biological and economic relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Western dry conifer forests continue to experience increased severe,
   stand-replacing wildfire that is outside of historical precedent. Fuels
   treatments, landscape-scale modifications of forest fuels and structure,
   are likely to remain a management tool to modify fire behavior and
   restore ecological resilience. The impacts of fuels treatments to listed
   species such as spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) remain uncertain and
   are contested because of limited available information. To evaluate
   spotted owl foraging habitat selection in a landscape recently modified
   by forest fuels-reduction treatments, we radio-marked and tracked 10
   California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) for 2 years immediately
   following fuels treatment installation in the northern Sierra Nevada,
   California, USA. We categorized fuels treatments into 3 types:
   mechanical thin, installed within the study area as landscape-scale fire
   breaks characterized by even tree spacing, open understory, and low
   canopy cover, or group selections; understory thin, a hand-removal of
   small trees and shrubs; and understory thin followed by underburn, a
   controlled surface-fuel burn that left the overstory intact. We
   described post-treatment habitat using forest structural metrics derived
   from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset that was collected 1
   year after fuels treatments were completed. We collected 436 spotted owl
   foraging locations during 2 breeding seasons and evaluated breeding
   season home range size and composition using a resource selection
   function. We assessed possible contributors to owl foraging patterns by
   comparing a priori hypotheses in an information-theoretic approach and
   using randomly generated points that estimated available habitat.
   Spotted owl breeding season home ranges contained fuels treatments in
   proportion to their availability on the landscape and averaged 17.1\%
   treated area. Within the home range, owl foraging locations in the
   post-treatment landscape were best predicted by lower proportions of
   gaps than anticipated at random, steeper slopes, and minimized distance
   from the owl's site center. Our results suggest that moderate to high
   proportions of gaps, typically a feature of forest fuels reduction and
   restoration treatments, may reduce the probability of spotted owl
   foraging. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Prior to European settlement, the 450 000-ha Pine Barrens region in
   northwestern Wisconsin, USA, was characterized by a landscape mosaic of
   large, open patches, savannas, and closed forest stands of jack pine
   (Pinus banksiana). Crown-fires created large open patches that persisted
   on the droughty soils, providing important habitat for a number of
   area-sensitive, open-habitat species. Insect outbreaks may have
   contributed to periodic fires by increasing the fuel load.
   Today, fires are suppressed in the managed landscape, but insect
   defoliation remains a major disturbance. Salvage logging commonly
   follows insect outbreaks. Our objective was to evaluate landscape
   pattern changes caused by this interaction of natural disturbances and
   forest management. We examined changes in landscape pattern during the
   most recent (1990-1995) outbreak of jack pine budworm (Choristoneura
   pinus pinus) in northwestern Wisconsin using four Landsat TM satellite
   images (1987, 1991, 1993, and 1995). The 1987 image provided the basis
   for a species-level forest classification identifying mature jack pine
   and open habitat prior to the budworm outbreak. Each subsequent image
   was used to identify clearcuts in mature jack pine. The 1995 image was
   also used to classify stand development in the open habitat of the 1987
   image so that the overall availability of open habitat in 1995 could be
   assessed. GIS data layers were used to analyze logging rates and
   clearcut sizes separately for different classes of land ownership and
   soils.
   Approximately 12 500 ha were salvage logged during the 1990-1995
   outbreak. Logging rates were highest on the most infertile soils, and on
   private, industrial forest land. Annual logging rates of different
   landowners were 3-6 times higher during the outbreak than previous to
   it. Salvage cut sizes were larger than clearcuts prior to the outbreak.
   New cuts were mostly located next to previous cuts, thus increasing the
   size of openings on the landscape.
   Initial survey results by N. Niemuth show that populations of one
   area-sensitive open-habitat species (Sharp-tailed Grouse, Tympanuchus
   phasianellus) thrive on the salvage cuts. Insect defoliation and
   subsequent salvage logging did create new habitat for open-habitat
   species that were declining.
   Landscape pattern changes due to multiple interacting disturbances have
   rarely been studied. The interaction of jack pine budworm defoliation
   and salvage logging substantially changed landscape pattern in the Pine
   Barrens. We speculate that interaction between insect defoliation and
   fire may have significantly shaped the presettlement landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in vegetative cover and land use in the southern part of the
   Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, were identified by analysing
   satellite images from 2001 and 2014. Fluctuations in population density
   of mammal species during 2001-2016 in response to these changes were
   analysed. During 2001-2014 the types of land use that increased in area
   (per year) were prescribed burning (uncontrolled burning caused by
   humans) by 105.11 ha, seasonal agricultural plots by 58.14 ha, areas
   without vegetation by 24.54 ha, and human settlements by 4.13 ha. In the
   same period, savannahs decreased by 103.94 ha, tropical dry forest by
   39.5 ha, secondary forests by 14.46 ha, and human-induced grassland by
   0.13 ha per year. The loss of these habitats resulted in low population
   densities of mammals, including the eastern cottontail Sylvilagus
   floridanus and the Tehuantepec jackrabbit Lepus flavigularis, which is
   categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. We recommend

Abstract = {{In the Appalachian portion of their breeding range, Golden-winged
   Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) nest in shrubland and regenerating
   forest communities created and maintained by disturbance. Because
   populations of Golden-winged Warblers have exhibited precipitous
   declines in population throughout their Appalachian breeding range,
   management activities that create or maintain early successional habitat
   are a priority for many natural resource agencies and their conservation
   partners. Within these early successional habitats, however, additional
   information is still needed concerning the relative importance of
   different vegetation features in selection of breeding territories by
   Golden-winged Warblers. Our objective, therefore, was to use logistic
   regression to estimate the probability of territory-level occupancy by
   Golden-winged Warblers in north-central Pennsylvania at two sites, each
   with its own early successional community, based on vegetation
   characteristics. Our communities were composed of shrublands and
   regenerating forest sites resulting from two disturbances: agriculture
   and forest fire. Despite differences in vegetation structure, portions
   of both study areas (regenerating forest and old field) supported
   territorial Golden-winged Warblers. Probability of territory occupancy
   by Golden-winged Warblers increased with percent blackberry (Rubus)
   cover in the regenerating forest community, and decreased as basal area
   and distance to microedge increased (i.e., as vegetation patchiness
   decreased) in both communities. These habitat features have also been
   found to influence other aspects of Golden-winged Warbler breeding
   ecology such as nest-site selection, pairing success, and territory
   abundance. Vegetation features influencing Golden-winged Warbler
   territory establishment can differ among shrubland and regenerating
   forest communities, and management decisions and outcomes may be
   affected by these differences. Our study provides a starting point for a
   more comprehensive hypothesis-driven occupancy survey to investigate
   features of the territories of Golden-winged Warblers across a broader
   geographic range and in different vegetation communities.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of a species may be simultaneously
   influenced by both local-scale habitat features and the broader patch
   and landscape contexts in which these populations occur. Different
   factors may influence patch occupancy (presence-absence) versus local
   abundance (number of individuals within patches), and at different
   scales, and thus ideally both occupancy and abundance should be
   investigated, especially in studies that seek to understand the
   consequences of land management on species persistence. Our study
   evaluated the relative influences of variables associated with the local
   habitat patch, hillside (patch context), and landscape context on patch
   occupancy and abundance of the collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris)
   within tallgrass prairie managed under different fire and grazing
   regimes in the northern Flint Hills of Kansas, USA. Using a multi-model
   information-theoretic approach that accounted for detection bias, we
   found that collared lizard abundance and occupancy was influenced by
   factors measured at both the local habitat and landscape scales. At a
   local scale, collared lizard abundance was greatest on large rock ledges
   that had lots of crevices, high vegetation complexity, and were located
   higher up on the hillslope. At the landscape scale, collared lizard
   abundance and occupancy were both higher in watersheds that were burned
   frequently (1-2 year intervals). Interestingly, grazing only had a
   significant effect on occupancy and abundance within less frequently
   burned (4-year burn interval) watersheds. Our results suggest that, in
   addition to the obvious habitat needs of this species (availability of
   suitable rock habitat), land-management practices have the potential to
   influence collared lizard presence and abundance in the grasslands of
   the Flint Hills. Thus, mapping the availability of suitable habitat is
   unlikely to be sufficient for evaluating species distributions and
   persistence in such cases without consideration of landscape management
   and disturbance history.}},

Abstract = {{Isoetes butleri Engelm. (Butler's Quillwort) is a lycopod endemic to the
   central and southeastern United States. It inhabits sparsely vegetated
   moist depressions within dolomite prairies that become ephemeral
   wetlands in the spring. Classified as endangered in portions of its
   range (Illinois and Kentucky), little is known about the ecology and
   genetics of I. butleri. In Illinois, the five known populations are
   disjunct from all other known populations, and there is concern that
   these populations could be vulnerable to a number of threats, including
   a lack of suitable microhabitats, displacement by other plant species,
   accumulation of plant litter, and low genetic diversity and limited gene
   flow. We evaluated these putative threats by analyzing demographic data
   collected by Plants of Concern, a citizen-science rare-plant monitoring
   program; performing experimental litter removals; and assessing
   population genetic structure. There were no significant differences in
   soil nutrient availability in topographically similar depressions with
   and without I. butted; however, areas inhabited by I. butleri had lower
   abundance of woody species and higher abundance of conservative (habitat
   specialist) species than uninhabited areas. Following experimental
   litter removal, I. butted exhibited lower size but higher density and
   recruitment. We found that all populations had high genetic diversity.
   However, there was also evidence of high inbreeding, which may be due to
   spatially fine-scale genetic structure and poor dispersal ability. Our
   findings suggest that reductions of woody plant growth and accumulated
   litter both of which can be achieved through prescribed fire should be
   management priorities for L butleri conservation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Fire kills Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp.

   L.), a highly flammable and invasive annual in sagebrush communities

   resilience of Wyoming big sagebrush communities with varying species
   composition, we studied 51 paired sites with burned and unburned areas.
   We quantified soil surface and foliar cover in 12 cover groups.
   Comparisons identified vegetation or soil surface factors that
   significantly (p <= 0.05) correlated (Spearman's rank correlation
   coefficient = rho) to burned area community composition. Cheatgrass
   cover in burned areas was greater where unburned areas had more
   cheatgrass cover (rho = 0.75), litter cover (rho = 0.31), and sagebrush
   plant canopy volume (rho = 0.40), and less bare soil (rho= -0.39) and
   cryptogamcover (rho= -0.32). Cheatgrass cover in burned areas was not
   significantly correlated with unburned area perennial grass or forb
   cover. Burned area perennial grass cover appeared to be related to more
   perennial grass (rho = 0.77) and native forb cover (rho = 0.30), but
   less cheatgrass cover (rho = -0.39) in unburned areas. Burned area
   native herbaceous dominance (native minus exotic herbaceous foliar
   cover) correlated with less cheatgrass cover (rho = -0.65) and sagebrush
   canopy volume (rho = -0.34) in unburned areas and with more perennial
   grass (rho = 0.30) and sagebrush relative cover (rho = 0.39) in adjacent
   unburned areas. Postfire site dominance could be of either native or
   exotic plants where cheatgrass cover on adjacent unburned sites was <
   about 15\%. Native species however, never dominated or increased in
   dominance where cheatgrass was above 15\%. Results suggest that
   cheatgrass cover before a fire played a strong role in determining
   postfire plant communities; this suggests management should focus on
   prefire and postfire management of cheatgrass and litter. Perhaps
   prescriptions and priorities should be more nuanced on the basis of
   driving variables of postfire response hypothesized to be cheatgrass,
   perennial grass, and shrub abundance. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{``Lameiros{''} are ancestral semi-natural meadows, essential elements of
   mountain landscapes in Northern Portugal. In the ``lameiros{''} a
   traditional irrigation system is used and water is applied all year

   bovine feeding, but they are also important for the water and nutrients
   cycle regulation, erosion control and as barrier to forest fires
   propagation. Although recognized for their economical, environmental,
   landscaping, cultural and genetic value, the perpetuation of these
   ``lameiros{''} could be at risk, at medium term, due to human
   desertification in the mountain regions and to the announced constraints
   in use of water resources. To preserve these landscapes it is essential
   to know them better and to better characterize them. Therefore a
   monitoring program using remote sensing tools is now being developed to
   evaluate different patterns of ``lameiros{''}, and their spatial extent
   and evolution. Two important questions are determinant in this program:
   the selection of the most appropriate spatial resolution for monitoring
   ``lameiros{''}, and the availability of satellite historical data. In
   this context, NDVI were compared in two selected test sites, with and
   without full irrigation. Data were derived from several field campaigns
   with a spectroradiometer and using different sensors: i) Landsat 5 and
   Landsat 7 (30m pixel), ii) SPOT 4 and SPOT 2 (20m pixel), iii) SPOT 5
   (10m pixel). The NDVI temporal series produced were evaluated
   considering ``lameiros{''} management and weather data. Results obtained
   so far indicate that the SPOT images provide data at the most adequate

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach that allows current, retrospective and future
   relative abundances of mammal species to be predicted across landscapes.
   A spatial generalized regression model of species relative abundance
   based on habitat quality and time since disturbance was combined with
   coverages of the spatial distribution of habitat quality derived from a
   simulation model which predicts the historical and future spatial
   arrangement of forest habitat. The strength of this approach is that the
   input habitat data can be derived as part of a standard forest inventory
   mapping program with the addition of high spatial resolution remote
   sensing imagery. Furthermore, it operates at the scale used for wildlife
   management in Australia, which makes it widely applicable. To
   demonstrate the approach we use data collected over 20 years on the
   long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and the large wallabies
   (red-necked wallaby, Macropus rufogriseus, and swamp wallaby, Wallabia
   bicolor) and their habitats following wildfire. Results indicate the
   relative abundance of the potoroo has increased, from initially sparse
   numbers of less than 0.5 \% of plot-night occurrences to close to 3\%
   approximately twenty years after a major fire event. The large wallabies
   by contrast decreased in relative abundance from about 20\% since the
   major fire event. Presently the relative abundance of large wallabies
   was modelled at 2\% of plot-nights with tracks which was very low.
   Predictions of future relative abundance without additional disturbance
   were low, with the region likely to be unsuitable for the species in the

Abstract = {{Factors associated with seed cone production in Pinus ponderosa were
   reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of
   restoration activities. Cone and seed production are quite variable,
   with differences between (1) years, (2) sites, and (3) individual trees.
   Between-year, population-wide crop failures suggest large-scale triggers
   for cone and seed production, perhaps high temperatures and dry weather.
   Stern diameter is the most important determinant for cone production at
   the tree level, with other factors such as genetic disposition,
   moisture, soil nutrients, and insect pests and disease playing a smaller
   role. Some extrinsic factors affect growth rate, indirectly affecting
   cone production. For example, less competition and lower stand densities
   result in P ponderosa trees that increase in diameter more quickly,
   possibly because of more light, and produce seeds earlier. This
   literature suggests that restoration activities, especially thinning,
   will result in trees better able to produce larger seed crops. The
   effect of prescribed fire is less clear, with contradictory effects
   depending on site conditions, burn severity, and nutrient status of the
   site.}},

   forester, Bernhard Fernow, the Fernow was initially developed with
   considerable assistance from the Civilian Conservation Corps. Shut down
   temporarily during World War II, the Fernow was reopened in 1948 as an
   outdoor laboratory and classroom with the purpose of conducting research
   that would be useful to the forest landowners and managers throughout
   the Central Appalachians. Early research focused on the silvicultural
   management of high-value hardwoods and the effects of various forest
   management schemes on water quantity and quality. Over time, additional
   research projects in wildlife, soil science, ecology, air quality, and
   other environmental topics were included. Today, the Fernow is involved

Abstract = {{Overstory tree thinning and prescribed fire are used to restore
   ecosystem structure and function in ponderosa pine (Pinus Ponderosa
   Laws.) forests of the southwest but little research has examined
   constraints on population-level responses of understory plants. In order
   to study growth and reproduction of a common shrub species after forest
   restoration treatments, we monitored Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus
   fendleri Gray) plants from 1999 to 2002 in thinned and unthinned
   overstory units. To study effects of tree thinning, we analyzed
   relationships of overstory stand density (Reineke's SDI) and
   current-year branch length. number of branches, and biomass, and also
   evaluated the importance of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky
   Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) herbivory (Browsing) as a predictor in
   linear models. To study effects of prescribed fire, we examined
   mortality, seedling emergence, and growth response on experimentally
   burned and unburned plots. SDI and browsing were significantly and
   negatively correlated with F. ceanothus current-year branch length,
   biomass, and leaf area but relationships were generally weak. Across the
   4 years, browsing appeared to be consistently more important than SDI in
   explaining variation in growth. Although SDI and browsing were
   significant predictors of growth in years with near normal
   precipitation, models failed in drought years. Burning resulted in
   17-32\% mortality whereas 0-5\% of plants died on unburned plots.
   Mortality of burned plants was positively related to amount of forest
   floor consumed during prescribed fires. One growing season after fire,
   surviving burned plants responded by producing long resprouts.
   Current-year branches were consistently longer on burned than unburned
   plants only where plots were protected from large herbivores. Unburned
   plants had more current-year branches and greater biomass than burned
   plants. No seedlings emerged on unburned plots but were found on 44\% of
   burned plots. A quadratic function represented the relationship between
   seedling emergence and forest floor consumption. Our results suggest
   that restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests of nor-them
   Arizona can help increase abundance of F. ceanothus but population
   responses may be slow, particularly when constrained by ungulate
   herbivory, fire-related mortality of plants and dormant seeds. and

Abstract = {{Fire is used as a management tool for biodiversity conservation
   worldwide. A common objective is to avoid population extinctions due to
   inappropriate fire regimes. However, in many ecosystems, it is unclear
   what mix of fire histories will achieve this goal. We determined the
   optimal fire history of a given area for biological conservation with a
   method that links tools from 3 fields of research: species distribution
   modeling, composite indices of biodiversity, and decision science. We
   based our case study on extensive field surveys of birds, reptiles, and
   mammals in fire-prone semi-arid Australia. First, we developed
   statistical models of species' responses to fire history. Second, we
   determined the optimal allocation of successional states in a given
   area, based on the geometric mean of species relative abundance.
   Finally, we showed how conservation targets based on this index can be
   incorporated into a decision-making framework for fire management.
   Pyrodiversity per se did not necessarily promote vertebrate
   biodiversity. Maximizing pyrodiversity by having an even allocation of
   successional states did not maximize the geometric mean abundance of
   bird species. Older vegetation was disproportionately important for the
   conservation of birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Because our method
   defines fire management objectives based on the habitat requirements of
   multiple species in the community, it could be used widely to maximize
   biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Hopper (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) introduced landscape age, climate
   buffering, and soil nutrient status as descriptors for a continuum
   between old, climatically buffered landscapes characterised by low soil
   fertility (OCBIL) and young, often disturbed landscapes characterised by
   fertile soils (YODFEL). Hopper (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) provided an
   important framework for biodiversity and conservation. We argue that
   Hopper's (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) conceptual framework includes five
   areas worthy of further consideration. These include: (1) The
   appropriateness of the original three dimensions; (2) The need for

   Broadening the globally relevant range of environments. (4)
   Operationalising the definitions or dimensions. (5) Revisiting the scale
   and compatibility of the predictions. Here, we address the first four of
   these areas and offer an alternative conceptual framework based on the
   idea of Old Stable Landscapes (OSLs). We redefine Hopper's climate
   buffering as a dimension of climate stability, identify
   soil-impoverishment as a function of landscape age, and recognise fire
   regime predictability as a large-scale, long-term evolutionarily
   important dimension. In so doing, we construct a globally-relevant,
   qualitative template to enable the testing of evolutionary-ecological
   hypotheses concerning biodiversity (e.g. species diversity, diversity
   gradients, endemism, speciation and extinction rates, cladogenesis,
   persistence of old lineages, refugial phenomena). Our template is
   characterised by having operationally defined dimensions, which can be
   used to design surveys and experiments to address the issues of
   biodiversity conservation, recovery, and restoration under variations in
   landscape age, climatic stability and fire regime.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Wetland managers rely on a variety of vegetation management techniques
   to set back plant succession, enhance seed production, create hemi-marsh
   conditions, and reduce the coverage of invasive plants in wetlands. We
   evaluated the effects of vegetation management techniques (prescribed
   burning, cattle grazing, mowing and disking) on aquatic invertebrate
   communities in seasonal wetlands in the Rainwater Basin Region of
   Nebraska, USA. Because many of these wetlands are embedded in an
   agricultural landscape, we also evaluated the effects of agriculture on
   aquatic invertebrates. We conducted the study in 24 wetlands during
   spring 2004 and 2005. In general, aquatic invertebrate richness and
   diversity were similar among wetlands subjected to different management
   regimes. However, richness and diversity were highest grazed wetlands
   and lowest in disked wetlands. Regardless of the management regime,
   total benthic and nektonic invertebrate biomasses were higher in managed
   wetlands than unmanaged wetlands. In 2004, naidid oligochaete biomass
   was highest in farmed wetlands. Cattle grazing, mowing, and prescribed
   burning seemed to have the greatest influence on individual taxa: 12,
   eight, and seven of the taxa (out of 32) had higher biomasses in grazed,
   mowed, and burned wetlands, respectively. Within mowed wetlands, the
   biomasses of some taxa (Gyraulus, Lymnaea, and Physa) were lower in
   managed areas than unmanaged areas, emphasizing the need to leave some
   areas unmanipulated to provide cover. Because of high spatial and
   temporal variability in wetlands and aquatic invertebrate communities,
   the response of aquatic invertebrates to vegetation management
   techniques was not consistent and no management regime offered a
   particular advantage in enhancing aquatic invertebrate communities.
   However, managers should be aware that some type of physical
   manipulation of aquatic vegetation in wetlands is still warranted on a
   regular basis to reduce nuisance vegetation, enhance seed production,
   and create optimal habitat conditions for migratory waterfowl and other
   wetland-dependent birds.}},

   wildlife habitat. It is a warm season, perennial grass native to
   freshwater wetlands throughout the southeastern United States, commonly

   can be attributed to its tolerance of wide ranges in edaphic and
   environmental gradients, including a tolerance for extended flooding or
   frequent fire. It reproduces clonally, with no evidence of seed
   viability. It is aggressive on some sites and forms dense, monotypic
   stands, but it is also associated with diverse emergent plant
   communities, which comprise other grasses, sedges, rushes, and
   bryophytes. Its habit of prolific root growth contributes to soil
   stabilization, peat formation, and nutrient immobilization. Maidencane
   also provides valuable refuge, nesting, and feeding habitat for myriad

Abstract = {{The importance of peatlands is being increasingly recognized
   internationally for both the conservation of biodiversity and the
   provision of ecosystem services; strategies are being developed
   world-wide to help maintain their integrity. Prescribed burning has been
   highlighted as a threat with considerable debate over its use as it is
   perceived to produce a Calluna vulgaris monoculture and a decline in
   preferred peat-forming species. We investigated the impact of prescribed
   burning on vegetation composition and diversity in a long-term
   experiment at Moor House NNR in northern England. The study comprised a
   comparison between no-burn reference plots last burned in ca. 1924 and
   an experiment where all plots were burned in 1954/5. Within the
   experiment, the effects of very light sheep grazing vs. no grazing and
   three burning rotations (no-burn since 1954/5, repeat-burning at 10- and
   20-year intervals) were tested. Calluna vulgaris and Hypnum jutlandicum
   cover and bryophyte species richness increased in the least-disturbed,
   no-burn reference plots, but bryophyte cover did not. Lichen diversity
   declined. Within the formal experiment, low-intensity sheep grazing had
   little impact but there were substantive changes produced by the
   different burning rotations. There was divergence between the burning
   rotation treatments with the least-disturbed, no-burn treatment changing
   towards a C.vulgarisH.jutlandicum community, whereas the most-disturbed
   10-year rotation had a much greater abundance of both Eriophorum and
   Sphagnum spp. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that
   blanket-bog vegetation on peat responds to prescribed burning in a
   complex manner. Where burn return interval is long (>20years),
   C.vulgaris becomes dominant and there was no evidence that preferred
   peat-forming species (Eriophorum/Sphagnum) increased. Where burn return
   interval is short (10years), E.vaginatum/Sphagnum abundance increased.
   We found no evidence to suggest that prescribed burning was deleterious
   to the abundance of peat-forming species; indeed, it was found to favour
   them. These results inform conservation management policy for blanket
   bogs in the UK and more generally for future wildfire-mitigation
   strategies on dwarf-shrub-dominated peatlands elsewhere. Some lessons
   for the management of long-term experimental studies are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating spatial and temporal variation in abundance due to
   anthropogenic and environmental disturbances is a central aspect of
   wildlife ecology and management. We conducted an experiment to evaluate
   the effects of salvage logging on the abundance of 22 avian species and
   6 foraging guilds in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by
   beetle outbreaks, south-central Oregon, USA, 19961998. Treatments
   consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only; live trees and
   ponderosa pine snags were not harvested. Our hierarchical model requires
   replicated count data from multiple sample units across several time
   periods, during which the population is closed, to estimate abundance as
   a function of logging treatment and management district while accounting
   for imperfect and variable detection probability. We fit the model to
   point counts from 12 control and 12 treatment plots with 3 surveys
   during each breeding season, 19961998. We found evidence for a large,
   but imprecise, effect of salvage logging in all 3 years for only 1
   species, the gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii). The abundance of the
   remaining species either did not change or displayed weak positive
   responses to the treatment. Although 3 foraging guilds increased in
   total abundance, 2 guilds did not change and the response of 1 guild
   changed direction in different years. Our results suggest that, unlike
   most postfire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after
   beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the
   maintenance of avian population sizes comparable to those found in
   unharvested stands. Future research should consider different sampling
   programs for those species with large home ranges (e.g., woodpeckers)
   that may not be sampled adequately using commonly employed programs

Abstract = {{Root-feeding beetles, including several species of Hylastes Erichson
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Hylurgops LeConte (Coleoptera:

   LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Pissodes Germar (Coleoptera:

   have emerged as serious problems in conifer plantations and forests in
   the United States and Canada in recent decades. Root-feeding beetles are
   particularly associated with stressed, diseased, or injured trees.
   Emerging adults kill seedlings by girdling them at the root collar and
   kill older trees, at least in the North and West, by transmitting fungal
   root pathogens in the genus Leptographium Lagerberg \& Melin
   (Ophiostomatales: Ophiostomataceae). In the South seedling, mortality
   can be as high as 60\% for seedlings planted in winter following fall
   harvest. For stands harvested after 1 July, planting should be delayed a
   full year. Broadcast insecticides can be used, but dipping seedlings in
   0.75\% permethrin prior to planting and physical barriers to feeding
   have proven effective. However, an integrated pest management approach
   that emphasizes a combination of measures to minimize attraction of
   beetles and to maintain health of host trees is recommended. Shelterwood
   harvest and soil scarification can create site conditions that minimize
   attraction of root beetles. Precommercial thinning and prescribed fire
   are often used to reduce tree competition and reduce vulnerability to
   stem-colonizing bark beetles. However, root beetles are attracted to
   thinned or burned stands, for at least 6-7 mo. Therefore, thinning
   should be avoided in areas of high risk for root disease transmission
   or, when necessary, thinning should be implemented during June or July
   following beetle dispersal in May. Semiochemicals can be used to monitor
   abundances of root beetles.}},

Abstract = {{ContextThe Canadian boreal forest provides valuable ecosystem services
   that are regionally and globally significant. Despite its importance,
   the future of the Canadian boreal forest is highly uncertain because
   potential impacts of future climate change on ecosystem processes and
   biomass stocks are poorly understood.ObjectivesWe investigate how
   anticipated climatic changes in coming decades could trigger abrupt
   changes in the biomass of dominant species in Canada's boreal
   forests.MethodsUsing the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-LMfire,
   which was parameterized for the dominant tree genera in Canada's boreal
   forests (Picea, Abies, Pinus, Populus) and driven by a large range of
   climate scenarios grouped by two forcing scenarios (RCP 4.5/8.5), we
   simulated forest composition, biomass, and the frequency of disturbance,
   including wildfire, from Manitoba to Newfoundland.ResultsResults suggest
   that responses of this region to a warmer future climate will be very
   important, especially in southern boreal areas and under the RCP 8.5
   forcing scenario. In these areas, reductions of total aboveground
   biomass incurred by fire and heat-induced tree mortality events are
   projected; the fertilizing effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 on
   forest productivity is unlikely to compensate for these losses.
   Decreases in total forest stocks would likely be associated with forest
   cover loss and a shift in composition in particular from needleleaf
   evergreen (softwood) to broadleaf deciduous (hardwood)
   taxa.ConclusionThe simulated future reduction in softwood biomass
   suggests that forest management strategies will have to be adapted to
   maintain a sustainable level of forest harvest and tree density that
   meets demands for wood products, while maintaining other ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Many rangelands in the southwestern United States provide quality
   habitat for Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). These same
   habitats are frequently managed for livestock production and thus are
   subjected to various brush management practices that are meant to
   enhance forage production. Bobwhites rely on woody cover for food,
   thermal and loafing cover, and protection from avian predators.
   Implementing brush management practices that reflect bobwhite
   requirements is important for managing usable space and viable
   populations. We described the structural vegetative characteristics
   associated with bobwhite locations and random locations on native
   rangelands in the upper Rolling Plains of Texas that are dominated by
   honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and managed with aerial herbicide
   and prescribed fire. We also used binary logistic regression to model
   habitat selection; the initial model was built using 67\% of the data (n
   = 179 used-random paired points) and then validated using the remaining
   33\% of the data (n = 88 used-random paired points). Locations used by
   bobwhites bad significantly larger mean values of percent brush canopy
   cover, visual obstruction, and angle of obstruction than did random
   locations; random locations had a greater mean value of percent bare
   ground than locations used by bobwhites. The resulting logistic
   regression model contained only the angle of obstruction; the model had
   an 80\% probability of correctly classifying used and random locations
   based on the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC). The model
   maintained a high classification probability when applied to the smaller
   validation data set, with an area under the ROC of 0.78.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Annual grasslands in California are often managed with seasonal grazing
   and prescribed burning on the assumption that such practices have
   long-term benefits for native species. Mature native perennial
   bunchgrasses, particularly Nassella pulchra (purple needlegrass), are
   often the focal species, although very little is known about responses
   at different life history stages. Thus, important questions remain about
   long-term population dynamics of both mature plants and seedling
   recruitment. In plots receiving repeated grazing and burning events over
   7 years, mortality of mature plants was threefold higher on mounds than
   on intermounds and likely reflected increased competition intensity
   associated with increased resource availability in deeper soil. Burning
   and grazing treatments had strong positive effects on basal area of
   mature N. pulchra . However, plants in grazed plots that were not burned
   contained considerable standing dead biomass. Topographic location
   strongly influenced growth as intermound plants grew relatively more
   than mound plants, but the effects on growth of burning and grazing did
   not vary with topographic location. In mapped plots N. pulchra
   recruitment was very low, and overall density dropped an average of
   31\%. However, a significant time-by-burning effect indicated that
   survival was significantly higher in burned plots. After 7 years of
   repeated treatments, effects of burning and grazing management on mature
   N. pulchra were positive but not for all phenological stages.
   Understanding long-term influence of management on bunchgrass
   populations may not be easy to determine because short-term results may
   not reflect long-term responses and some life cycle dynamics may be
   observed only over very long periods.}},

Abstract = {{Coleoptera are important components of forest ecosystems and can be
   affected by forest management schemes aimed at limiting fuel build-up.
   Our research objective was to determine if repeated applications of fuel
   reduction treatments resulted in changes in abundance or diversity of
   beetle (Coleoptera) families, genera, and species within upland mixed
   hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians Mountains, North Carolina,
   USA. We established three replicate blocks ( 56 ha) and split each block
   into four fuel reduction treatments. Treatments included prescribed
   burning, mechanical felling, a combination of prescribed burning and
   mechanical felling, and a control (i.e., no fuel reduction techniques
   applied). We implemented treatments multiple times (2 mechanical
   thinnings and 4 prescribed burns) over the course of a 15-year period.
   Using pitfall and colored pan traps, we captured 7037 coleopterans
   comprised of 62 families over a three-year period. Total coleopteran
   abundance and diversity were similar across all treatments; however,
   some beetle families, genera, and species responded to treatments.
   Nitidulidae were significantly more abundant within controls compared to
   all other treatments in 2015, whereas Mordellidae generally had higher
   abundances in mechanical and bums compared to mechanical in 2015 and
   mechanical and controls in 2016. Chrysomelidae was significantly more
   abundant in mechanical and burns compared to all other treatments over
   the entire duration of the study. However, Staphylinidae abundance was
   significantly lower in mechanical and burns compared to the other
   treatments. Numerous genera and species also showed variable
   treatment-level responses. Burn treatments killed some mature trees and
   reduced forest canopy cover, resulting in higher light availability and
   thereby greater herbaceous cover and diversity on the forest floor. This
   vegetation in the understory of burned treatment units may be partially
   responsible for many of the treatment-level responses of beetle taxa we
   documented. This study took place after several rounds of fuel reduction
   techniques were applied over a 15 year period. Some beetle abundance
   responses were immediate; whereas other groups seemed to be influenced
   by the application of treatments over time, highlighting the need to
   examine long-term responses to forest management practices.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a bark
   beetle that attacks and kills ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), among
   other pine species throughout the western conifer forests of the United
   States and Canada, particularly in dense stands comprising large trees.
   There is information on the stand conditions that the insect prefers.
   However, there is a paucity of information on how small-scale variation
   in stand conditions influences the distribution of tree mortality within
   a stand. I examined the small-scale distribution of ponderosa pine basal
   area pre- and post a mountain pine beetle infestation, and used
   geostatistical modeling to relate the spatial distribution of the host
   to subsequent MPB-caused tree mortality. Results indicated increased
   mortality in the denser parts of the stand. Previous land management has
   changed historically open low-elevation ponderosa pine stands with
   aggregated tree distribution into dense stands that are susceptible to
   mountain pine beetles and intense fires. Current restoration efforts are
   aimed at reducing tree density and leaving clumps of trees, which are
   more similar to historical conditions. The residual clumps, however, may
   be susceptible to mountain pine beetle populations. Land managers will
   want to be cognizant of how mountain pine beetles will respond to
   restoration treatments, so as to prevent and mitigate tree mortality
   that could negate restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{We trapped snakes in two annually burned and two long-term unburned

   spatial distribution and responses to forest disturbance}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{572-581}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity is vital for fully functional natural habitats, and the
   maintenance of biodiversity through effective conservation planning
   depends on reliable information on its spatial distribution and response
   to anthropogenic disturbance. However, gathering extensive data on
   multiple species is a difficult task, due to logistical and financial
   constraints and the lack of taxonomic expertise. A common resource to
   address this hurdle is the use of surrogate taxa: focusing on a limited
   set of species that provide information that can be extrapolated to
   wider patterns of biodiversity and ecological integrity. We examine this
   by (1) testing if species richness proportions among different
   taxa/methodology employed (ants, birds sampled with point counts, birds
   sampled with mist nets, dung beetles, trees and saplings) will be
   similar across different undisturbed Amazonian forests, and (2) if
   patterns of local congruence in richness and community composition are
   consistent in undisturbed forest and gradients of forest disturbed by
   forest fires. Our results indicate that species richness, across field
   sites, was positively associated at a regional scale. At a local scale,
   richness and community composition in unburned forest showed virtually
   no correlation between the taxa, but the inclusion of samples from
   burned forest increased the number of significant correlations.
   Vegetation (trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height) composition was
   the best indicator of overall community composition of all other taxa.
   The congruence of regional patterns of richness is likely a consequence
   of macro variables such as climate and biogeographical history, and
   should not be extrapolated to local scales. Although the use of
   community composition metrics increased congruence at a local scale, we
   highlight the importance of using a broad ecological gradient. (C) 2013

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{821-826}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Forest restoration intended to reduce the overabundance of dense
   vegetation can be at odds with wildlife habitat conservation,
   particularly for species of wildlife that are strongly associated with
   structurally diverse forests with dense canopies. The fisher (Pekania
   pennanti), a mesopredator that occurs in mid-elevation forests of the
   southern Sierra Nevada, is such a species and managers are challenged to
   address fuel accumulations while at the same time maintaining sufficient
   habitat. We were interested in whether fishers tolerate the amount of
   management-related disturbance that fire ecologists predict will be
   sufficient to reduce the severity and spread rate of fires. To address
   this question we related an index of relative fisher abundance to data
   on the amount of each sample area that has been affected by one or more
   forms of disturbance. These are forms of forest management associated
   with either restoration activities (e.g., thinning, prescribed fire) or
   timber harvest (e.g., clear cutting, selection harvest). We used scat
   detection dogs to determine the relative abundance of scats in each of
   15, 14 km(2) hexagonal sample areas that were sampled twice a year for 4
   years. These data were used to classify each sample area as either low,
   moderate or high relative abundance of fishers. We also summarized for
   each of the sample areas the total number of hectares (including
   overlap) affected by management activities each year, and generated a
   3-year running average. The areas exhibiting the highest use by fishers
   had an average of 36.7 hectares per year affected by ground-disturbing
   activities. Given that each sample area was 1400 hectares, this suggests
   that fishers consistently occupy at the highest rate of use places where
   an average of 2.6\% of the area has been disturbed per year. This
   translates to an average of 7.4 ha of disturbance/year/km(2) (47.1 acres
   of disturbance/year/mi(2)). This is more disturbance than was predicted
   to be necessary to treat forests to reduce fire spread rate and severity
   in the southern Sierra Nevada, but less than predicted to be necessary
   by fire models for other geographic locations. Our work suggests that it
   may be possible to implement restorative treatments at an extent and
   rate that achieves fire modeling goals and does not affect occupancy by
   fishers. Implementation of such an approach, however, should also
   consider protection of large trees (conifers and hardwoods) used as
   resting and denning sites and account for the maintenance of habitat
   connectivity. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Forests form the critical source water areas for downstream drinking
   water supplies in many parts of the world, including the Rocky Mountain
   regions of North America. Large scale natural disturbances from wildfire
   and severe insect infestation are more likely because of warming climate
   and can significantly impact water quality downstream of forested
   headwaters regions. To investigate potential implications of changing
   climate and wildfire on drinking water treatment, the 2003 Lost Creek
   Wildfire in Alberta, Canada was studied. Four years of comprehensive
   hydrology and water quality data from seven watersheds were evaluated
   and synthesized to assess the implications of wildfire and post-fire
   intervention (salvage-logging) on downstream drinking water treatment.
   The 95th percentile turbidity and DOC remained low in streams draining
   unburned watersheds (5.1 NTU, 3.8 mg/L), even during periods of
   potential treatment challenge (e.g., stormflows, spring freshet); in
   contrast, they were elevated in streams draining burned (15.3 NTU, 4.6
   mg/L) and salvage-logged (18.8 NTU, 9.9 mg/L) watersheds. Persistent
   increases in these parameters and observed increases in other
   contaminants such as nutrients, heavy metals, and chlorophyll-a in
   discharge from burned and salvage-logged watersheds present important
   economic and operational challenges for water treatment; most notably, a
   potential increased dependence on solids and DOC removal processes. Many
   traditional source water protection strategies would fail to adequately
   identify and evaluate many of the significant wildfire- and post-fire
   management-associated implications to drinking water ``treatability{''};
   accordingly, it is proposed that ``source water supply and protection
   strategies{''} should be developed to consider a suppliers' ability to
   provide adequate quantities of potable water to meet demand by
   addressing all aspects of drinking water ``supply{''} (i.e., quantity,
   timing of availability, and quality) and their relationship to
   ``treatability{''} in response to land disturbance. (c) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Helonias bullata (Swamp Pink) is a federally threatened plant found in
   many of the wetlands throughout US Army Garrison, Fort A.P. Hill, VA.
   Wetlands that support Swamp Pink are exposed to periodic occurrences of
   wildland fire. However, much is not yet known about the relationship
   between this species and wildland fire. This study examines plant-level
   characteristics (i.e., number of leaves, rosette size) in relation to
   habitat-level characteristics through comparison of Swamp Pink under 2
   land-management regimes in different military training zones. We
   evaluated the forest compositional differences based on the
   presence/absence of wildland fire and military-training zone in wetlands
   supporting Swamp Pink and in adjacent uplands using non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures
   (MRPP), indicator-species analysis (ISA), and measures of density,
   dominance, herbaceous cover, and species richness. Swamp Pink rosettes
   in wetlands exposed to fire were significantly larger and averaged
   nearly 1 more leaf per rosette as compared to those surveyed in wetlands
   that were not exposed to fire. There was significantly less upland tree
   density in burned sites compared to unburned sites. We found no
   relationship between training zones and Swamp Pink size and the number
   of leaves. Additional differences in forest composition were revealed by
   comparing training zone and the presence/absence of wildland fire in
   conjunction with one another. Compared to other areas, the training
   zones with lower fire-frequency and recent evidence of fire featured
   significantly larger rosettes with more leaves. In uplands, overall
   community composition was significantly different among plots exposed to
   different fire-management strategies (MRPP; P < 0.05), but no such
   differences occurred in wetlands (P > 0.05). This finding suggests that
   wetlands limit the effects of fire on community composition. ISA showed
   that in both wetlands and uplands, different species characterized areas
   with differing fire influence, suggesting some influence by wildland
   fire even when such effects were not reflected in overall changes to
   community composition. The results of this study, the life-history of
   Swamp Pink, and the distribution of the species in ecosystems
   characterized by fire (e.g., the New Jersey Pine Barrens) suggest that
   Swamp Pink is not negatively impacted by fire to a significant degree.
   The conservation of the Swamp Pink habitat at Fort A. P. Hill may in
   fact benefit from periodic occurrences of wildland fire. Further
   research is warranted.}},

   Implicit in the derivation of statistical models is the assumption that
   they are strictly applicable only for the species or conditions for
   which they were developed. The result has been a profusion of separate
   models of uncertain generality. A parallel research effort, the process
   approach, has been directed at modeling tree injury and mortality by
   directly simulating the energy-transfer process from the fire to the
   exterior surface of the plant, and thence into roots, stems, and
   foliage. Process models can currently predict stem or tree death if
   certain injury thresholds are reached. We present a brief review of the
   current understanding of the biophysical processes causing fire-induced
   plant injury, and focus on the challenges associated with defining
   boundary conditions, initial conditions, and thermal and physical
   properties required for modeling plant heating and tissue necrosis. We
   argue for integration of statistical and process approaches to
   predicting tree injury and mortality wherein process models provide
   inputs for statistical models. Research gaps that hinder the application
   of process-based tree injury and mortality models include linkage of
   fire effects models with combustion models (especially coupled
   fire-atmosphere models) through the boundary conditions required for
   simulating tissue heating, descriptions of live tree thermal and
   physical characteristics, and better understanding of the physiological
   basis for delayed fire-caused mortality and the interactions between
   fire injury and second-order causes of mortality such as diseases and
   insects.}},

Abstract = {{The Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) is a major
   forest pest at epidemic densities, capable of killing entire stands of
   mature pine. There are a variety of tactics used by forest managers to
   control MPB epidemics, but the ecology of the insect and the large scale
   of MPB infestations make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of
   any management strategy. Using a partial differential equation
   framework, we develop a mathematical model describing the interactions
   between beetles, beetle pheromone, and susceptible trees across multiple
   years. We use our mathematical model to examine the effectiveness of
   various existing management approaches used to limit the spread of the
   MPB. In particular, our study focuses on management activities that were
   used in Banff National Park, in Alberta, Canada. Comparing the indirect
   controls of prescribed burning and clearcutting, we found the success of
   these methods is critically dependent on the level of MPB attraction to,
   and productivity in, partially burned trees. Our analysis also indicates
   that pheromone baiting in combination with tree removal is successful at
   reducing MPB impact at high beetle densities, but may lead to greater
   forest impact and greater MPB population growth at low beetle densities.
   Finally, we found that removal of beetle-attacked trees in the absence
   of baiting is the most successful strategy if managers are able to
   locate areas with significant MPB activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   Invasive Asian Clam (Corbicula fluminea) and Zebra Mussel (Dreissena

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Control strategies for established populations of invasive alien species
   can be costly and complex endeavours, which are frequently unsuccessful.
   Therefore, rapid-reaction techniques that are capable of maximising
   efficacy whilst minimising environmental damage are urgently required.
   The Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea Muller, 1774), and the zebra mussel
   (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771), are invaders capable of adversely
   affecting the functioning and biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems.
   Despite efforts to implement substantial population-control measures,
   both species continue to spread and persist within freshwater
   environments. As bivalve beds often become exposed during low-water
   conditions, this study examined the efficacy of steam-spray (>= 100
   degrees C, 350 kPa) and open-flame burn treatments (similar to 1000
   degrees C) to kill exposed individuals. Direct steam exposure lasting
   for 5 min caused 100\% mortality of C. fluminea buried at a depth of 3
   cm. Further, combined rake and thermal shock treatments, whereby the
   substrate is disturbed between each application of either a steam or
   open flame, caused 100\% mortality of C. fluminea specimens residing
   within a 4-cm deep substrate patch, following three consecutive
   treatment applications. However, deeper 8-cm patches and water-saturated
   substrate reduced maximum bivalve species mortality rates to 77\% and
   70\%, respectively. Finally, 100\% of D. polymorpha specimens were
   killed following exposure to steam and open-flame treatments lasting for
   30 s and 5 s, respectively. Overall, our results confirm the efficacy of
   thermal shock treatments as a potential tool for substantial control of
   low-water-exposed bivalves. Although promising, our results require
   validation through upscaling to field application, with consideration of
   other substrate types, increased substrate depth, greater bivalve
   densities, non-target and long-term treatment effects.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of fire and herbivory on vegetation structure
   has been the subject of much debate in savanna ecology. Fire regime and
   herbivore numbers are two key variables that managers of protected areas
   can manipulate to meet their conservation objectives. We deployed a new
   airborne remote sensing system (Carnegie Airborne Observatory) to the
   Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, to map a unique herbivore/fire
   exclusion experiment on basaltic soils. We collected high resolution (56
   cm) three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structural data over areas that
   have been protected from herbivores (34 yr) and/or fire (7 yr), as well
   as those exposed to both disturbance agents. Canopy height distribution,
   as well as the distribution of foliage within the vertical canopy
   profile, differed significantly between all treatments and between each,
   treatment and the control area (Kolmogorov-Smimov, p < 0.001). Herbivory
   exerted a greater influence on vegetation 3-D structure and
   heterogeneity than did fire. At the broad scale, total percentage woody
   cover was 36 times greater in areas protected from herbivores, compared
   to the control area. At a finer scale, areas protected from herbivores
   contained 5 times more tall tree canopy (> 9 m) and up to 66 times more
   small tree canopy (3-6 m). Fire restricted growth of vegetation in the
   0-3 m height range, both in the absence and presence of herbivores. Our
   findings highlight the active role that conservation managers can play
   in modifying vegetation structure and heterogeneity through herbivore
   and fire management, as well as the value of 3-D remote sensing for the
   assessment of conservation management outcomes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Forest encroachment into savanna is occurring at an unprecedented rate
   across tropical Africa, leading to a loss of valuable savanna habitat.
   One of the first stages of forest encroachment is the establishment of
   tree seedlings at the forest-savanna transition. This study examines the
   demographic bottleneck in the seedlings of five species of tropical
   forest pioneer trees in a forest-savanna transition zone in West Africa.
   Five species of tropical pioneer forest tree seedlings were planted in
   savanna, mixed/transition, and forest vegetation types and grown for 12
   months, during which time fire occurred in the area. We examined
   seedling survival rates, height, and stem diameter before and after
   fire; and seedling biomass and starch allocation patterns after fire.
   Seedling survival rates were significantly affected by fire, drought,
   and vegetation type. Seedlings that preferentially allocated more
   resources to increasing root and leaf starch (starch storage helps
   recovery from fire) survived better in savanna environments (frequently
   burnt), while seedlings that allocated more resources to growth and
   resource-capture traits (height, the number of leaves, stem diameter,
   specific leaf area, specific root length, root-to-shoot ratio) survived
   better in mixed/transition and forest environments. Larger (taller with
   a greater stem diameter) seedlings survived burning better than smaller
   seedlings. However, larger seedlings survived better than smaller ones
   even in the absence of fire. Bombax buonopozense was the forest species
   that survived best in the savanna environment, likely as a result of
   increased access to light allowing greater investment in belowground
   starch storage capacity and therefore a greater ability to cope with
   fire. Synthesis: Forest pioneer tree species survived best through fire
   and drought in the savanna compared to the other two vegetation types.
   This was likely a result of the open-canopied savanna providing greater
   access to light, thereby releasing seedlings from light limitation and
   enabling them to make and store more starch. Fire can be used as a
   management tool for controlling forest encroachment into savanna as it
   significantly affects seedling survival. However, if rainfall increases
   as a result of global change factors, encroachment may be more difficult
   to control as seedling survival ostensibly increases when the pressure
   of drought is lifted. We propose B. buonopozense as an indicator species
   for forest encroachment into savanna in West African forest-savanna
   transitions.}},

Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing recognition of the conservation values of grassy biomes,
   our understanding of how to maintain and restore biodiverse tropical
   grasslands (including savannas and open-canopy grassy woodlands) remains
   limited. To incorporate grasslands into large-scale restoration efforts,
   we synthesised existing ecological knowledge of tropical grassland
   resilience and approaches to plant community restoration. Tropical
   grassland plant communities are resilient to, and often dependent on,
   the endogenous disturbances with which they evolved - frequent fires and
   native megafaunal herbivory. In stark contrast, tropical grasslands are
   extremely vulnerable to human-caused exogenous disturbances,
   particularly those that alter soils and destroy belowground biomass
   (e.g. tillage agriculture, surface mining); tropical grassland
   restoration after severe soil disturbances is expensive and rarely
   achieves management targets. Where grasslands have been degraded by
   altered disturbance regimes (e.g. fire exclusion), exotic plant
   invasions, or afforestation, restoration efforts can recreate vegetation
   structure (i.e. historical tree density and herbaceous ground cover),
   but species-diverse plant communities, including endemic species, are
   slow to recover. Complicating plant-community restoration efforts, many
   tropical grassland species, particularly those that invest in
   underground storage organs, are difficult to propagate and re-establish.
   To guide restoration decisions, we draw on the old-growth grassland
   concept, the novel ecosystem concept, and theory regarding tree cover
   along resource gradients in savannas to propose a conceptual framework
   that classifies tropical grasslands into three broad ecosystem states.
   These states are: (1) old-growth grasslands (i.e. ancient, biodiverse
   grassy ecosystems), where management should focus on the maintenance of
   disturbance regimes; (2) hybrid grasslands, where restoration should
   emphasise a return towards the old-growth state; and (3) novel
   ecosystems, where the magnitude of environmental change (i.e. a shift to
   an alternative ecosystem state) or the socioecological context preclude
   a return to historical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Management strategies for old growth pine forests have recently begun to
   include prescribed bums. Fire could influence interactions between bark
   beetles and mature pine trees, but we cannot predict the effects because
   we know too little about the numeric and functional responses of bark
   beetle populations to fire, and because we do not know how fire affects
   the oleoresin defense system of pine trees. We estimated population
   abundance of Ips spp. (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), and the resin flow of
   mature red pines (Pinus resinosa), before and after a prescribed burn,
   inside and outside the burn, in an old growth forest at Itasca State
   Park, Minnesota. Following a prescribed burn in April, the local
   abundance of Ips pini increased by two-fold during May, decreased by a
   comparable amount during 6 weeks starting in mid-July, and was otherwise
   unchanged. The abundance of I. grandicollis and I. perroti were
   unaffected, while that of a specialist predator, Thanasimus dubius
   (Coleoptera: Cleridae) increased by 30-90\% during May. Many mature
   trees that sustained no visible crown damage from the fire were attacked
   by Ips within the scorched region of the lower bole. Oleoresin how
   increased substantially in trees with scorched boles, which may limit
   the probability that trees will be killed by bark beetles following a
   ground fire. We tested whether fire increases the probability that a
   healthy tree will sustain bark beetle attacks by locating
   beetle-infested trees inside and outside the burned area, and comparing
   their growth history (from growth rings) with paired, unattacked trees.
   Surprisingly, there was no indication of recently declining growth, or
   chronically slow growth, in beetle-infested trees, either inside or
   outside the prescribed burn. Half of the trees attacked by Ips in 1998
   were dead in 1999 and the remainder were partly girdled by the attacks,
   which increases their subsequent vulnerability to fires, insects, and
   pathogens. Ips bark beetles can exert meaningful effects on the
   survivorship of red pine populations, and their demographic impact is
   probably increased by ground fires. e zool Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{1. Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) exert strong effects on plants in
   tropical savannas, and many wild LMH populations are declining. However,
   predicting the impacts of these declines on vegetation structure remains
   challenging.
   2. Experiments suggest that tree cover can increase rapidly following
   LMH exclusion. Yet it is unclear whether these results scale up to
   predict ecosystem-level impacts of LMH declines, which often alter fire
   regimes, trigger compensatory responses of other herbivores and
   accompany anthropogenic land-use changes. Moreover, theory predicts that
   grazers and browsers should have opposing effects on tree cover, further
   complicating efforts to forecast the outcomes of community-wide
   declines.
   3. We used the near-extirpation of grazing and browsing LMH from
   Gorongosa National Park during the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) as a
   natural experiment to test whether megafaunal collapse increased tree
   cover. We classified herbaceous and tree cover in satellite images taken
   (a) at the onset of war in 1977 and (b) in 2012, two decades after
   hostilities ceased.
   4. Throughout the 3620-km(2) park, proportional tree cover increased by
   34\% (from 0.29 to 0.39) an addition of 362 km(2). Four of the park's
   five major habitat zones (including miombo woodland,
   Acacia-Combretum-palm savanna, and floodplain grassland) showed even
   greater increases in tree cover (51-134\%), with an average increase of
   94\% in ecologically critical Rift Valley habitats. Only in the eastern
   Cheringoma Plateau, which had historically low wildlife densities, did
   tree cover decrease (by 5\%).
   5. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that reduced
   browsing pressure enhanced tree growth, survival and/or recruitment; we
   found no directional trends in rainfall or fire that could explain
   increased tree cover.
   6. Synthesis. Catastrophic large-herbivore die-offs in Mozambique's
   flagship national park were followed by 35 years of woodland expansion,
   most severely in areas where pre-war wildlife biomass was greatest.
   These findings suggest that browsing release supersedes
   grazer-grass-fire feedbacks in governing ecosystem-level tree cover,
   consistent with smaller-scale experimental results, although the
   potentially complementary effect of CO2 fertilization cannot be
   definitively ruled out. Future work in Gorongosa will reveal whether
   recovering LMH populations reverse this trend, or alternatively whether
   woody encroachment hinders ongoing restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of the bilby Macrotis lagotis was assessed in the
   Tanami Desert using stratified random plots, repetitively sampled
   transects, aerial survey transects, and ground truth plots. Compared to
   a previous assessment of distribution, the extent of occurrence has
   changed little in the last 20 yr. However, the area of occupancy is
   small relative to the extent of occurrence and <25\% of the current
   geographic range has bilby sign <20 km apart. Generalised linear
   modelling was used to determine the strength of association between
   bilby occurrence and habitat variables and identify refugia
   characteristics. Four competing candidate models were examined to
   determine whether bilby occurrence associated significantly with
   productive substrates and introduced herbivores, the distribution of key
   predator species, the pattern of fire, and climatic gradients including
   rainfall and temperature. For the entire study area, bilby presence
   associated most strongly with variables of mean annual rainfall,
   substrate type and the probability of dingo occurrence. Proximity to
   recently burnt habitat formed a significant predictor of bilby
   occurrence in a model derived for a reduced part of the study area where
   most sign was found. The work suggested that the current frameworks

Abstract = {{An effective approach to increase forest health is to identify and
   validate a suite of indicators for monitoring forest conditions. We
   sought indicators of impacts due to deer browsing, prescribed burn,
   visitor use, and trails on understory plants beside trails in an
   oak-pine savanna in Finery Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada. Six
   commonly used ecological indicators were studied in 216 I-m x I-m
   quadrats located 0, 3, and 15 m from nine trails: plant species
   richness, stem density, species cover, proportion of native species,
   median height of selected tree seedlings, and proportion of foliar
   damage (insect herbivory) on leaves of neighboring trees. Three levels
   of visiter use, two of deer densities, and two of prescribed burns were
   used in analysis. Plant stem density and cover per quadrat were
   sensitive to the effects of deer density, prescribed burn, and visitor
   use. The proportion of native species per quadrat was affected by
   prescribed burn, distance from trail edge, and visitor use. The number
   of nonnative species increased along trail edges, but numbers of native
   species were similar throughout. Plant species richness, median seedling
   height, and proportion of foliar herbivory per quadrat were only
   sensitive to deer density. Higher deer densities led to significant
   declines in species richness, stem density, cover, and median seedling
   height. Prescribed burns proved to be beneficial to the forest, with
   stem density and cover increasing in burned areas, although the
   proportion of exotic species also increased in burned areas.
   Surprisingly, high visitor use had a moderately positive impact on the
   forest, with density and cover increasing on trails with high visitor
   use, and proportion of native species highest on trails with moderate
   visitor use. Of the indicators studied in the park, stem density, cover,
   and the proportion of native species responded strongly to browsing,
   fire, visitor use, and trail impacts. Similar studies at other parks
   would help managers to focus long-term monitoring efforts on the most
   sensitive site-specific indicators.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced forest succession and associated accumulations of forest
   biomass in the Blue Mountains of Oregon and Washington and Intermountain
   area have led to increased vulnerability of these forests to insects,
   diseases, and wildfire. One proposed solution is large-scale conversion
   of these forests to seral conditions that emulate those assumed to exist
   before European settlement: open-spaced stands (ca, 50 trees per ha),
   consisting primarily of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and
   western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt,), We question how well
   presettlement forest conditions are understood and the feasibility and
   desirability of conversion to a seral state that represents those
   conditions. Current and future expectations of forest outputs and values
   are far different from those at presettlement times. Emphasis on
   prescribed fire for achieving and maintaining this conversion raises
   questions about how well we understand fire effects on forest resources
   and values. We consider here potential effects of prescribed fire on two
   key aspects of forest management-productivity and wildlife. Use of
   large-scale prescribed fire presents complex problems with potential
   long-term effects on forest resources, Before implementing prescribed
   fire widely, we need to understand the range of its effects on all
   resources and values. Rather than attempting to convert forests to
   poorly described and understood presettlement seral conditions, it would
   seem prudent to examine present forest conditions and assess their
   potential to provide desired resource outputs and values, Once this is
   achieved, the full complement of forest management tools and strategies,
   including prescribed fire, should be used to accomplish the desired
   objectives. We suggest a more conservative approach until prescribed
   fire effects are better understood. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of available nitrogen are critical
   determinants of the distribution and abundance of plants and animals in

   below tree and shrub canopies contain higher amounts of resources,
   including available nitrogen, than are present in interspace areas.
   Disturbances, such as prescribed fire and tree removal, are common
   management practices in shrub-woodland ecosystems, but it is not known
   if these practices affect resource islands. We examined temporal
   variation in resource islands of available nitrogen and their retention
   after fire and woody plant removal. From August 1997 to October 1998,
   soil nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) were measured monthly from
   canopy and interspace plots within four juniper-sagebrush sites along a
   precipitation gradient in central Oregon, USA. At each site, soil
   samples were collected from untreated plots, plots in which woody plants
   were removed, and those treated with prescribed fire in fall 1997. In
   burned treatments, canopy concentrations were significantly higher than
   interspace concentrations throughout the measurement period. Canopy NO3-
   and NH4+ concentrations were significantly higher on burned vs. unburned
   treatments for four months after fire. After woody plant removal, NO3-
   and NH4+ concentrations did not differ from the controls. Untreated
   control areas had higher NO3- and NH4+ concentrations under juniper
   canopies for nearly all months. Wetter sites had smaller differences
   between canopy and interspace concentrations through time than did the
   two drier sites. In relation to NO3- and NH4+ in this ecosystem,
   resource islands appear to be more ephemeral in wetter sites, and more
   pronounced following fire disturbances than in controls or those treated

   of standing snags and surface fuels were made 2, 4, 6, and 8 years after

   retention level, with values ranging from 0-60 Mg ha(-1) by year eight.
   However, when expressed as a percent of standing retained biomass,
   surface fuel accumulation was not related to treatment. In year 8,
   surface fuel was 81\% of retained bole biomass. The retention of snags
   after this wildfire event provided snags for wildlife foraging and
   nesting habitat, however most of these snags were lost within 8 years
   after the fire. White fir snags were more stable than pine and appeared
   to be used with greater frequency than pine for cavity excavation.

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{389-393}},

Abstract = {{1. A key challenge in the study of mutualistic interactions is
   understanding sources of variation that strengthen or weaken these
   interactions. In spider-plant mutualisms, spiders benefit plants by
   improving plant nutrition and protecting plants from herbivory. Although
   the benefits of plants to spider growth and survival are often claimed,
   they are rarely demonstrated.
   2. In this study, empirical evidence is provided that bromeliads
   (Bromelia balansae, Bromeliaceae) are essential for the resilience of
   the mutualistic bromeliad-living jumping spider populations (Psecas
   chapoda, Salticidae) after a fire event, sheltering spiders from the
   heat of the flames.
   3. Spider populations were compared before and after a natural fire
   event and it was shown that spiders of different ages survived the fire.
   The survival of such individuals allowed the population of P. chapoda
   spiders to recover rapidly, returning to pre-fire levels in 5 months.
   4. Bromeliads reduced the susceptibility of P. chapoda spiders to
   burning, and this mutualistic relationship contributed to the resilience
   of the spider population after a fire event. It is suggested that
   frequent fires in fire-prone landscapes may have strengthened this
   spider-plant relationship, contributing to the maintenance and evolution
   of this association.}},

Abstract = {{Since European settlement Australian native mammals have experienced
   significant extinctions and severe declines in the range and abundance
   of populations. Longitudinal studies are required to identify declines
   and activate timely management. Population studies of native small
   mammal communities were conducted across the eastern Otway Ranges during
   1975-2007; however, their subsequent status was unknown. We aimed to:
   compare the current occurrence and abundance of species and communities
   (2013-18) to those in previous decades across major vegetation
   communities (heathy woodland, low forest, sand heathland, headland
   scrub, coastal dunes and estuarine wetland), and identify change
   characteristics and management priorities. Live trapping was employed to
   assess mammals at 30 sites across seven vegetation communities. In
   total, 67\% of sites exhibited large to severe decreases in abundance
   and only 3\% of sites had more than four species compared to 27\% in
   earlier decades. Declines occurred following wildfire and drought, with
   drivers likely to be multifactorial. While regional declines were
   significant, higher mammal abundance (two- to six-fold) and native
   species richness were recorded at coastal dune sites, indicating that
   this community provides important mammal refuges. Identification of

   units 38 years after treatment exceeded the pretreatment level, and
   biomass utilization intensity did not affect shrub recovery (ratio of

   changed immediately after harvesting (2 years); however, the species
   composition of treated units did not differ from the untreated control
   38 years after harvesting. Biodiversity indices (Shannon's and Pielou's

Abstract = {{Using a largely temperate forest perspective, this article briefly
   reviews four often inter-related types of landscape change which can
   have significant impacts on tropical and temperate forest biodiversity:
   logging, fire, forest clearing, and plantation expansion. There are many
   important similarities but also key differences in the kinds of work
   conducted on these four kinds of landscape change in tropical and
   temperate forests. For example, direct studies of the effects of forest
   conversion on biodiversity are relatively rare in both tropical and
   temperate ecosystems. Temperate forest research differs from tropical
   research in terms of relative amount of single species work, long-term
   studies, and research at scales spanning multiple landscapes. There are
   key areas for cross-fertilization of research in tropical and temperate
   forest biomes. These include: (1) the ability of species to persist in
   post-disturbed forest landscapes, including those perturbed by past
   clearing, logging or wildfire, (2) the impacts of plantation
   establishment on biodiversity, (3) the effectiveness of altered
   silvicultural systems on forest structure, vegetation composition, and
   biota, and (4) inter-relationships between forest logging and
   fire-proneness. Cross-learning about the impacts of drivers of landscape
   change between tropical and temperate forests is fundamental for
   speeding the progress of conservation efforts in both broad kinds of
   environments. However, some opportunities for cross-learning have not
   been taken because temperate and tropical forest research has often
   sometimes been isolated from one another. Some approaches to tackle this
   problem are briefly outlined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The quokka, Setonix brachyurus, is a medium- sized, macropodid marsupial
   that is endemic to south- western Australia. It has declined markedly in
   its distribution and abundance since the early 1930s and is listed as
   vulnerable under IUCN criteria. The presence or absence of quokka
   populations at 66 sites in the northern jarrah forest of Australia was
   investigated using generalised linear models ( GLM). We hypothesised
   that fox control and the presence of a mosaic of post- fire seral stages
   within Agonis linearifolia swamp vegetation were important in predicting
   the presence of quokkas. The number of poison meat baits delivered per
   hectare, the average number of years since the swamps burnt and the
   number of post- fire age classes within the swamps ( mosaic value) were
   used as explanatory variables. Two models had substantial support (Delta
   AIC(c) < 2), with the best approximating model including the variables
   `baiting' and `swamp age', and the second-best model including the
   additional variable `swamp mosaic value'. The two best models had Akaike
   weights ( weight of evidence as being the best model of the data) of
   0.465 and 0.308 respectively. We used an information-theoretic approach
   and multimodel inference to determine the best approximating model of
   baiting, swamp age and swamp mosaic, and Akaike weights to assess model
   fit and to rank variable importance. Baiting had a model average
   parameter estimate of 98, swamp age 79 and a mosaic of swamp age classes
   42, implying that baiting was more than twice as important as the number
   of swamp ages classes at a site in predicting the occurrence of quokkas.
   Evidence from our analysis therefore supports previous studies that
   concluded that continued fox control and the maintenance of a mosaic of
   early seral stage (< 10 years since fire) and long unburnt habitat (> 19
   years since fire) are essential for its conservation.}},

Abstract = {{In pyrogenic ecosystems, fire often plays an integral part in plant
   population dynamics. For a subset of plant species in such ecosystems,
   fire is connected to seed set and/or germination, resulting in postfire
   recruitment episodes. We investigated the relationship between fire and
   seed set in the perennial forb Liatris ohlingerae (Asteraceae), one of
   many species endemic to the pyrogenic Lake Wales Ridge ecosystem of
   central Florida. Our study focused on comparisons of seed production and
   invertebrate damage to flowers across L. ohlingerae populations in
   locations encompassing a range of intervals since fire, between 1 mo and
   9 yr prior to the study. We found that the estimated seed set was
   significantly higher in populations burned less than 1 yr prior to the
   study than in all other populations. Both low invertebrate damage and
   high seed production rates contributed to this trend in the populations
   burned < 1 yr prior to the study. Previous research has demonstrated
   that germination of L. ohlingerae seeds is higher and seed predation is
   lower in more recently burned patches, so it is likely that the pulse of
   seed production observed in recently burned populations would carry
   through to the seedling stage. The processes behind the observed
   increase in fecundity remain unknown, and their characterization will
   likely be valuable for continued efforts to conserve L. ohlingerae.
   Because invertebrate damage did not significantly influence seed
   production, it need not be prioritized for conservation management.}},

   interpret data, synthesizes information over successive layers of logic
   topics, and draws inferences about the ecological integrity of LTAs as
   an initial step to identifying high priority LTAs for landscape
   restoration on NFS lands. Results from the analysis showed that about 74
   percent of NFS lands had moderate or better overall ecological
   integrity. Major impacts to ecological integrity included risk of
   mortality due to insects and disease, extent of current mortality,
   extent of areas with high and very high wildfire hazard potential,
   uncharacteristically severe wildfire, and elevated temperatures. In the
   discussion, we consider implications for agency performance reporting on

Abstract = {{Efforts to halt the decline of the northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus; bobwhite) across its distribution have had limited success.
   Understanding bobwhite habitat requirements across the annual cycle and
   at varying scales is essential to aid efforts to conserve bobwhites. We
   monitored radio-tagged bobwhites from 2016 to 2018 on a 165-km(2)portion
   of Fort Bragg Military Installation in the Sandhills physiographic
   region of North Carolina, USA, to determine factors influencing
   non-breeding bobwhite habitat selection at multiple scales. We used
   generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized linear mixed models to
   assess bobwhite habitat selection at the microsite scale (the immediate
   vicinity of an animal) and the macrosite scale (across the study area),
   respectively, by comparing used points to available random points. At
   the microsite scale, bobwhites strongly selected areas with greater
   woody understory cover. Also, bobwhite selection increased with greater
   forb and switchcane (Arundinaria tecta) cover, but this effect plateaued
   at 65\% forb cover and 50\% switchcane cover. At the macrosite scale,
   bobwhites generally selected areas with greater understory cover within
   a 200-m radius but avoided areas with >55\% understory cover; these
   areas primarily were located in the core areas of drainages with
   extensive ericaceous vegetation. Bobwhites selected areas with 3-6
   m(2)/ha hardwood basal area in uplands, potentially because of the
   availability of mast, but avoided uplands when pine (Pinusspp.) or
   hardwood basal area exceeded 20 m(2)/ha or 12 m(2)/ha, respectively,
   likely because high basal area is associated with increased shading and
   subsequent loss of understory cover. In addition, bobwhites selected
   uplands 1 growing season (>= 2-month period falling entirely between 1
   Apr and 1 Oct) post-fire regardless of burn season. Overall, managers
   seeking to improve habitat quality for bobwhites in longleaf pine (Pinus
   palustris) woodlands should employ management practices that maintain
   available woody understory across the landscape to provide cover during
   the non-breeding season. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{In ecology textbooks prior to the 1970s, Aldo Leopold's classic story of
   predator control, overpopulation of deer, and habitat degradation on the
   Kaibab Plateau during the 1920s epitomized predator regulation of
   herbivore populations. However, the story disappeared from texts in the
   late 20th century after several papers noted uncertainties in
   estimations of the deer population and provided alternative
   explanations. We re-examined the case study by determining the age
   structure of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) on the plateau. Aspen
   comprises the majority of deer browse in the summer, and the absence of
   a normal cohort of aspen from the 1920s would indicate deer
   overpopulation. The number of aspen (at 1.4 m) dating to the 1920s was
   an order of magnitude lower than the null expectation. Other periods of
   unusual numbers of aspen included high numbers of aspen dating to the
   1880s and 1890s (when regular surface fires ceased), few aspen dating
   from 1953 to 1962 (after a second irruption of the deer population), and
   very high numbers from 1968 to 1992 (coincident with widespread
   logging). These convergent lines of evidence support the idea of extreme
   deer herbivory in the 1920s, consistent with food limitation of deer at
   high populations (bottom-up control) and predation limitation at low
   deer populations (top-down control). Some uncertainty remains within the
   overall story, and this level of ambiguity is common in case studies
   that involve population ecology, land management, and people at the
   scale of 1,000 km(2) and 100 years. A complete version of the Kaibab
   deer story and its history would be a valuable, realistic case study for
   ecology texts.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of fire as a management tool often focus on how fire alters
   microclimate and affects plant quality. While these processes are
   important, they may act on a target species indirectly through species
   interactions. Fender's blue {[}Plebejus (=Icaricia) icarioides fenderi]
   is an endangered butterfly found in fire dependent upland prairies in
   Oregon's Willamette Valley, USA. In this study, we measured oviposition
   preference and overwinter larval survival and how they responded to an
   experimental burn. To explore the mechanism underlying differences in
   these vital rates, we studied gross plant chemistry of Fender's blue
   larval host plants Kinkaid's lupine (Lupinus oreganus = L. sulphureus
   spp. kincaidii) and spur lupine (L. arbustus) and monitored how
   temperature and fire history affect the mutualism between Fender's blue
   larvae and a variety of tending ants. We used open top chambers to
   expand the range of observable temperatures, overlaid with the
   experimental burn to determine how both factors affected ant recruitment
   and duration of tending bouts. Oviposition rates and overwinter larval
   survival were higher in previously burned areas. We found no
   corresponding change in plant chemistry. Ant tending was affected by
   both temperature and fire history, with larvae able to recruit ants more
   quickly in warmer temperatures and fire history influencing the length
   of tending bouts. Differences in ant tending may explain enhanced
   overwinter survival. This case study highlights the importance of
   indirect (through species interactions) as well as direct effects in
   determining the impacts of fire on population dynamics of an at-risk

Abstract = {{Butterflies such as the atala hairstreak, Eumaeus atala Poey, and the
   frosted elfin, Callophrys irus Godart, are restricted to frequently
   disturbed habitats where their larval host plants occur. Pupae of these
   butterflies are noted to reside at the base of host plants or in the
   leaf litter and soil, which may allow them to escape direct mortality by
   fire, a prominent disturbance in many areas they inhabit. The capacity
   of these species to cope with fire is a critical consideration for land
   management and conservation strategies in the locations where they are
   found. Survival of E. atala pupae in relation to temperature and
   duration of heat pulse was tested using controlled water bath
   experiments and a series of prescribed fire field experiments. Survival
   of E. atala pupae was correlated to peak temperature and heat exposure
   in both laboratory and field trials. In addition, E. atala survival
   following field trials was correlated to depth of burial; complete
   mortality was observed for pupae at the soil surface. Fifty percent of
   E. atala survived the heat generated by prescribed fire when
   experimentally placed at depths >= 1.75cm, suggesting that pupation of
   butterflies in the soil at depth can protect from fatal temperatures
   caused by fire. For a species such as E. atala that pupates above
   ground, a population reduction from a burn event is a significant loss,
   and so decreasing the impact of prescribed fire on populations is
   critical.}},

Abstract = {{One of 3 populations of the state-threatened western gray squirrel
   (Sciurus griseus) in Washington occurs in the northern Cascade Range
   (i.e., North Cascades), where long-term fire suppression has increased
   the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Land management agencies throughout
   this region have implemented fire fuel reduction programs that alter
   squirrel habitat and may affect their populations. From April 2008 to
   September 2011, we investigated resource selection of 38 radio-collared
   western gray squirrels at 2 study sites in the North Cascades following
   fire fuel management activities including mechanical thinning and
   prescribed burning. We developed conditional logistic models to examine
   resource selection at 3 spatial scales: nest trees, nest sites, and core
   areas within home ranges. The odds of a squirrel selecting a tree for
   nesting increased with dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) presence,
   greater number of surrounding trees with interlocking branches, and tree
   size. Squirrels selected nest sites that had greater canopy cover, tree
   connectivity, and presence of dwarf mistletoe than available, unused
   sites. Core-use areas within home ranges had greater canopy cover, a
   greater number of tree species, and trees with higher live crowns
   compared to low-use areas. Our results indicate that fire fuel
   treatments may negatively affect western gray squirrel habitat across
   multiple spatial scales. Most variables that were positively related to
   habitat selection are specifically targeted for reduction in fire fuel
   management plans and were lower in sampled treated areas compared to
   untreated areas within the study sites. Key considerations in designing
   fuel reduction programs that benefit both squirrel habitat conservation

   suitable canopy cover and connectivity, retaining large trees of a mix

Abstract = {{Heathland management is an important tool with which to modify ecosystem
   impacts caused by atmospheric nutrient deposition. Since changes in
   nutrient availability as a result of management measures affect the
   outcomes of heathland succession and species competition, studies on
   this issue are important from both a nature conservation and management
   point of view. This study reports the effects of prescribed burning on
   nutrient availability in dry heathland soils and the nutrient content of
   the two competing heathland species Calluna vulgaris and Deschampsia
   flexuosa, with particular reference to N and P. We hypothesise that
   winter prescribed burning leads to additional N availability, which
   enhances the importance of P in the context of nutrient limitation in
   heathland ecosystems. In the nature reserve ``Lueneburg Heath{''} (NW
   Germany) we examined the availability of nutrients in the humus horizons
   and in the leachate as well as the relevant C:element ratios in Calluna
   and Deschampsia before and after a burning experiment. Our results show
   that prescribed burning resulted in drastically increased NH4+
   availability in the O-horizon. We observed only short-term effects (for
   NO3-, PO43-, Mg) and insignificant effects on the availability of other
   nutrients (K, Ca). As a consequence of an increased nutrient
   availability in the humus horizons and a limited nutrient uptake by
   plants after burning, leaching increased significantly for N, Ca, K, and
   Mg after burning treatment. No significant changes were found in the
   foliar C:N ratios for either species after prescribed burning, although
   Deschampsia showed an increased deficiency for all the other nutrients,
   particularly for P, as expressed by increased foliar C:P and N:P ratios.
   By contrast, the nutrient content of Calluna did not change
   significantly, suggesting that prescribed burning favours the
   competitive capacity of Calluna as against Deschampsia. We assume that
   water shortage as a result of changes in the microclimate was mainly
   responsible for the deterioration of the nutrient content of
   Deschampsia. This gives Calluna a competitive advantage, enabling it to
   out-compete Deschampsia on burned heathlands, with respect to the key
   factor P-limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Cactoblastis cactorum, a phycitid moth, has been used with considerable
   success as a biological control agent against several different cactus
   species in many parts of the world, including Opuntia stricta in Kruger
   National Park {[}KNP], South Africa. Although the moth has become
   widespread and abundant in KNP, its populations have not reached levels
   where it is able to provide the desired level of control on the alien
   species which has invaded more than 35 000 ha of the park and continues
   to spread. Although several factors, especially acquired predators and
   parasitoids, are known to curb the abundance of C. cactorum in South
   Africa, the extent to which this applies in KNP is unknown. Logistic
   regression and Canonical Community Analysis were used to determine the
   biotic and abiotic factors affecting the distribution and abundance of
   C. cactorum in KNP. To do this, maps of the ranges of the insect and
   host plant were constructed and integrated with other environmental
   features. The logistic regression showed that O. stricta density had no
   influence on whether or not C. cactorum was present in an area. The
   Canonical Community Analysis suggested that a high fire frequency, the
   herbicide control programme and the presence of small host plants may be
   important in limiting the distribution of C. cactorum, either directly
   or indirectly, through impacts on associated predators or parasitoids.

Abstract = {{Invasive plant species have become increasingly problematic in tropical
   and sub-tropical ecosystems, with the potential to decrease native plant
   diversity, increase fire occurrence, and cause ecosystem degradation.
   Numerous factors including disturbance due to fire, grazing, roads,
   human activities, reduction of native diversity, and soil fertility are
   known to influence invasibility of a habitat and/or promote the spread
   of invasive species. We studied invasive species distribution and
   abundance in a 519 km(2) wildlife reserve that has sub-tropical woodland
   and grasslands. We sampled 134 plots of size 30 x 30 m(2) and found that
   Mikania micrantha (a climber) and Chromolaena odorata (a shrub) were the
   most prominent invasive plants. We then tested the influence of eleven
   environmental variables that are either direct measures or proxies of
   resource availability, vegetation density, disturbance, and moisture
   stress. Using these predictors, we performed a decision-tree-based
   regression and prediction to test the influence of these variables on
   invasive species abundance and to generate distribution maps. The model
   had significant predictive power in the case of Mikania (R-2 = 0.469)
   but was poor for Chromolaena (R-2 = 0.056). Annual precipitation, soil
   phosphorus, and vegetation attributes had a significant influence in
   Mikania, and fire frequency had the strongest influence on Chromolaena.
   We could not quantify direct disturbance such as cattle grazing and
   resource extraction, which could add to the predictive power for these
   species. Given that invasive species continue to expand in range and
   abundance, more directed ecological monitoring and analyses are needed
   to manage ecosystems under the threat of invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US\$1.76
   billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The
   habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that
   wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant
   and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms
   in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP
   fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various
   growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing
   and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and
   facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species
   richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the
   region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of
   prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and
   to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management
   to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species
   colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established
   sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive
   observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories
   for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985
   grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding
   GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs
   with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the
   last 5 years were 57\% for adult males, 41\% for adult females, and 12\%
   for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site
   fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were
   unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species.
   Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation
   structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management
   of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation
   of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation
   physical structure rather than species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Afzelia africana is a tropical multi-use tree species distributed in
   West, East, and Central Africa. Understanding factors affecting
   seedlings is crucial to design an effective conservation and restoration
   plan for the species. Here, we examined the factors constraining
   seedling density and survival. We randomly established 203 circular
   plots of 5-m radius around adult trees in two different management
   systems (Agro-silvo-pastoral system and Protected Area). Then, we
   focused on the measurement of seedling density, survival/mortality in
   2014 and 2015, and estimated disturbance and micro-environment features.
   We found that seedling mortality rate was higher in Agro-silvo-pastoral
   system than in Protected area, demonstrating the prominent role of the
   protected area for the species conservation. The more intense adult
   trees are pruned, the lower the seedling density beneath, showing a
   negative effect of pruning on seedling. Seedling density is relatively
   higher under large trees, revealing the seedlings recruitment bottleneck
   due to repeated fire and browsing. Furthermore, our data supported the
   Janzen-Connell effect, suggesting that seedlings are attacked by
   predators of their parents. Finally, we conclude that management system,
   pruning intensity, seedling predation determine the regeneration status
   of A. africana in Sudanian zone. Artificial regeneration program is
   necessary, as well as shelters and thorny protectors should be
   established around seedlings under reproductive trees. Firebreaks are
   also recommended to protect the seedlings and Afzelia stands.}},

   regimes that are mostly anthropogenic. We show that the NACP is older
   and more climatically stable than usually assumed, spatially
   heterogeneous and extremely rich in species and endemics for its range
   of latitude, especially within pine savannas and other mostly herbaceous
   and fire-dependent communities. We suspect systematic biases and
   misconceptions, in addition to missing information, obscure the
   existence of similarly biologically significant regions world-wide.
   Potential solutions to this problem include (1) increased field
   biological surveys and taxonomic determinations, especially within
   grassy biomes and regions with low soil fertility, which tend to have
   much overlooked biodiversity; (2) more research on the climatic refugium
   role of hotspots, given that regions of high endemism often coincide
   with regions with low velocity of climate change; (3) in low-lying
   coastal regions, consideration of the heterogeneity in land area
   generated by historically fluctuating sea levels, which likely enhanced
   opportunities for evolution of endemic species; and (4) immediate
   actions to establish new protected areas and implement science-based
   management to restore evolutionary environmental conditions in newly
   recognized hotspots.}},

Abstract = {{Ecohydrological linkages between phosphorus (P) production, stream
   algae, benthic invertebrate, and fish communities were studied for
   4years after severe wildfire in the Rocky Mountains (Alberta, Canada).
   Mean concentrations of all forms of P (soluble reactive, total
   dissolved, particulate, and total) were 2 to 13 times greater in burned
   and post-fire salvage-logged streams than in unburned streams (p<0.001).
   Post-disturbance recovery of P was slow with differences in P-discharge
   relationships still evident 5years after the fire (p<0.001). Coupled P
   and sediment interactions were likely responsible for slow recovery of P
   regimes in fire-disturbed watersheds. P loading was associated with
   strong ecological responses in stream biota. Annual algal productivity
   was 5 to 71 times greater in streams within burned watersheds than in
   reference watersheds and persisted for 5years after the fire (p<0.001).
   Elevated algal production was associated with strong differences in
   benthic invertebrate community structure, including greater invertebrate
   densities, biomass, species diversity, and shifts in species
   composition. Monotonic shifts in invertebrate stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotope ratios indicated increased consumption of autochthonous food
   sources and effects on energy pathways for invertebrates from
   fire-affected streams. Wildfire-related changes at lower trophic lead to
   increases in size (weight and length) and growth rate (weight:age
   ratios) of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). This cascading series
   of effects of wildfire on stream productivity (primary production,
   secondary invertebrate consumers, and fish) may be long-lived legacies
   of wildfire because of the slow recovery of P regimes. Copyright (c)

   severity fire areas at 10-11 years postfire in the 2002 McNally fire
   area. Contrary to the prevailing current hypothesis regarding fisher
   postfire habitat use, fishers did not use higher severity fire areas
   less than low-moderate-severity areas or unburned forest (n = 77 scats),
   and female fishers used the large, intense McNally fire area
   significantly more than unburned forest (n = 12 scats). Female fishers
   were detected at multiple locations >250 m into the interior of a very
   large (>5,000 ha), unlogged higher severity fire patch. These results
   indicate unlogged higher severity fire areas are suitable habitat for

Abstract = {{Global conservation assessments recognize the mediterranean biome as a
   priority for the conservation of the world's biodiversity. To better
   direct future conservation efforts in the biome, an improved
   understanding of the location, magnitude and trend of key threats and
   their relationship with species of conservation importance is needed.
   Mediterranean-climate regions in California-Baja California, Chile,
   South Africa, Australia and the Mediterranean Basin.
   We undertook a systematic, pan-regional assessment of threats in the
   mediterranean biome including human population density, urban area and
   agriculture. To realize the full implications of these threats on
   mediterranean biodiversity, we examined their relationship with species
   of conservation concern: threatened mammals at the global scale and
   threatened plants at the subecoregional scale in California, USA.
   Across the biome, population density and urban area increased by 13\%
   and agriculture by 1\% between 1990 and 2000. Both population density
   and urban area were greatest in California-Baja California and least in
   Australia while, in contrast, agriculture was greatest in Australia and
   least in California-Baja California. In all regions lowlands were most
   affected by the threats analysed, with the exception of population
   density in the Chilean matorral. Threatened species richness had a
   significant positive correlation with population density at global and
   subecoregional scales, while threatened species were found to increase
   with the amount of urban area and decrease as the amount of natural area
   and unfragmented core area increased.
   Threats to mediterranean biodiversity have increased from 1990 to 2000,
   although patterns vary both across and within the five regions. The need
   for future conservation efforts is further underlined by the positive
   correlation between species of conservation concern and the increase in
   population density over the last decade. Challenges to reducing threats
   extend beyond those analysed to include human-environmental interactions
   and their synergistic effects, such as urbanization and invasive species
   and wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary fire regimes are recognized as a key threatening process
   for relatively immobile vertebrates and narrowly dispersing obligate
   seeder plant taxa in fire-prone Australian savannas. Here, we assess the
   efficacy of proposed ecological performance threshold metrics for
   evaluating the current state of fire management for biodiversity
   conservation outcomes in Australia's premier, and best publicly funded
   savanna reserve, Kakadu National Park. The assessment draws on available
   data describing Landsat-scale fire mapping over the period 1997-2015,
   habitat mapping, and mostly modeled responses of vegetation and faunal
   attributes. Despite conceptual and technical issues associated with
   various proposed performance thresholds and mapping products, the
   assessment demonstrates significant challenges with the current state of
   the reserve's fire management program. For example, by the end of 2015
   it was observed that just 6\% of woodland habitat in lowland and 23\% in
   upland situations had remained unburnt for longer than three years and
   98\% of mapped fires in lowland and 87\% in upland habitats were >1
   km(2) in extent. Of 14 assessed performance threshold metrics, two were
   within acceptable thresholds at the end of 2015, and none had improved

   resources evidently required to deliver effective, seasonally intensive,
   fine-grained adaptive fire management for biodiversity conservation

   resourcing opportunities through market-based savanna burning greenhouse

Abstract = {{Altered disturbance regimes are a major driver of biodiversity loss
   worldwide. Maintaining or re-creating natural disturbance regimes is
   therefore the focus of many conservation programmes. A key challenge,
   however, is to understand how co-occurring disturbances interact to
   affect biodiversity. We experimentally tested for the interactive
   effects of prescribed fire and large macropod herbivores on the
   web-building spider assemblage of a eucalypt forest understorey and
   investigated the role of vegetation in mediating these effects using
   path analysis. Fire had strong negative effects on the density of
   web-building spiders, which were partly mediated by effects on
   vegetation structure, while negative effects of large herbivores on web
   density were not related to changes in vegetation. Fire amplified the
   effects of large herbivores on spiders, both via vegetation-mediated
   pathways and by increasing herbivore activity. The importance of
   vegetation-mediated pathways and fire-herbivore interactions differed
   for web density and richness and also differed between web types. Our
   results demonstrate that for some groups of web-building spiders, the
   effects of co-occurring disturbance drivers may be mostly additive,
   whereas for other groups, interactions between drivers can amplify
   disturbance effects. In our study system, the use of prescribed fire in
   the presence of high densities of herbivores could lead to reduced
   densities and altered composition of web-building spiders, with
   potential cascading effects through the arthropod food web. Our study
   highlights the importance of considering both the independent and
   interactive effects of disturbances, as well as the mechanisms driving
   their effects, in the management of disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Questions In African savannas, Macrotermes termites contribute to
   small-scale heterogeneity by constructing large mounds. Operating as
   islands of high nutrient and water availability and low fire frequency,
   these mounds support distinct, diverse communities of trees that have
   been shown to be highly attractive to browsers. However, the distinct
   traits of tree species on termite mounds have hardly been studied, even
   though this may help to understand processes determining (1) their
   characteristic community structure and (2) attractiveness for browsers.
   Here, we compare functional trait and browser preference values between
   tree species on and off termite mounds. Location Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park,
   Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods We recorded tree community
   compositions for 16 large Macrotermes natalensis mounds and 16 control
   plots of 100 m2 each in a paired design. For each observed tree species
   we measured 22 traits, related to water and nutrient use, fire
   tolerance, light competition and anti-herbivore defence, and compared
   average trait values between mound and control communities. Furthermore,
   we investigated the feeding preferences of ungulate browsers for the
   most common tree species and how this was linked to their associated
   traits. Results Termite mounds supported tree communities that were
   distinct from the surrounding savanna vegetation. Mounds hosted more
   evergreen and less leguminous tree species than control communities, and
   the dominant species were less mechanically defended, less nutritious,
   had larger leaves and lower wood density than the species dominating
   control plots. Browsers preferred leguminous tree species with high leaf
   N and P content, which were relatively rare on termite mounds.
   Conclusions Overall, we conclude that termite mounds in this savanna
   form small refuges for tree species that seem less adapted to fire (more
   evergreens), have low nutrient availability (less nitrogen fixers) and
   suffer from water stress (larger leaf sizes) than typical savanna trees.
   Surprisingly, despite their reputation as browsing hotspots, the tree
   species dominating mounds are less nutritious and less preferred by
   browsers than tree species of the surrounding savanna, which may be
   explained by the relatively nutrient-rich nature of this savanna or
   intraspecific trait differences.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{465}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Similar to trends across the eastern United States, the central
   Appalachian Mountains were nearly entirely deforested by the early 20th
   century, then regenerated with a drastically altered disturbance regime.
   Forests found across much of the region today share little resemblance
   to the forest communities in which native wildlife evolved, including
   bobcats (Lynx rufus), a species adapted to stalking and ambushing prey
   in dense concealment cover. Managers implement efforts to restore
   historical forest structure and create wildlife habitat using prescribed
   fire, timber harvest, and maintained clearings. We developed resource
   selection functions utilizing GPS telemetry data from 9 bobcats (6 male,
   3 female) monitored in 2018-2019 to investigate how prescribed fire,
   timber harvest, and forest edge may influence 3rd order (i.e. within
   home range) resource selection of bobcats in the Appalachian Mountains
   of western Virginia, USA. We found that bobcats selected for
   forest-edge, fire-created canopy openings, and recently harvested forest
   stands, and avoided the forest interior. Bobcats are likely selecting
   for these areas because of increased prey and cover. The comparatively
   widespread use of fire in this study area has allowed novel insight into
   the effects of prescribed fire on bobcat space use and demonstrates the
   ecological importance of future efforts to restore historical fire
   cycles in the Appalachians. As one of the largest carnivores in
   Appalachian ecosystems and the only wild felid remaining in the region,
   we suggest managers consider bobcat ecology when planning habitat
   management strategies and communicate those strategies to the public.
   Our results demonstrate that silvicultural practices that aim to mimic
   historical forest disturbance likely benefit native wildlife, as evident
   from selection of these treatments by bobcats in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Resource selection by animals influences individual fitness, the
   abundance of local populations, and the distribution of species.
   Further, the degree to which individuals select particular resources can
   be altered by numerous factors including competition, predation, and
   both natural- and human-induced environmental change. Understanding the
   influence of such factors on the way animals use resources can guide
   species conservation and management in changing environments. In this
   study, we investigated the effects of a prescribed fire on small-scale
   (microhabitat) resource selection, abundance, body condition, and
   movement pathways of a native Australian rodent, the bush rat (Rattus
   fuscipes). Using a before-after, control-impact design, we gathered data
   from 60 individuals fitted with spool and line tracking devices. In
   unburnt forest, selection of resources by bush rats was positively
   related to rushes, logs and complex habitat, and negatively related to
   ferns and litter. Fire caused selection for spreading grass, rushes, and
   complex habitat to increase relative to an unburnt control location. At
   the burnt location after the fire, rats selected patches of unburnt
   vegetation, and no rats were caught at a trapping site where most of the
   understory had been burnt. The fire also reduced bush rat abundance and
   body condition and caused movement pathways to become more convoluted.
   After the fire, some individuals moved through burnt areas but the
   majority of movements occurred within unburnt patches. The effects of
   fire on bush rat resource selection, movement, body condition, and
   abundance were likely driven by several linked factors including limited
   access to shelter and food due to the loss of understory vegetation and
   heightened levels of perceived predation risk. Our findings suggest the
   influence of prescribed fire on small mammals will depend on the
   resulting mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches and how well this
   corresponds to the resource requirements of particular species.}},

Abstract = {{The fruits of Erithalis fruticosa L. and Lantana involucrata L. are
   important in the diet of US federally endangered Kirtland's Warblers
   (Setophaga kirtlandii) wintering in the Bahamas archipelago. These two
   shrubs occur in tropical and subtropical dry forests, including forests
   that have been subjected to recent disturbance. Despite their importance
   to the endangered warbler, the disturbance ecology of these shrubs is
   poorly understood. We sought to determine, based on functional
   characteristics of the plants, whether their presence is favored by a
   particular type or regime of disturbance.
   We used data from field experiments (seed broadcasting and shrub
   cutting) conducted on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas to determine
   mechanisms of and conditions favoring establishment and persistence
   ('vital attributes') of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, which enabled
   categorization according to the plant functional types defined by Noble
   and Slatyer (1980). We then compared hypothesized distributions of these
   plant functional types among different anthropogenic disturbance regimes
   to observed distributions of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata in order to
   identify disturbance regimes most likely to produce habitat used by
   Kirtland's Warblers.
   E. fruticosa and L. involucrata were functionally categorized as widely
   dispersed but largely shade intolerant species capable of establishing
   or regenerating individuals after disturbance via both seeds and
   vegetative mechanisms. Both hypothesized and observed distribution
   patterns indicated the shrubs were favored by a regime of frequent
   disturbance producing open canopy and ground layers. Among the
   anthropogenic disturbances we examined, areas of large-scale land
   clearing combined with subsequent goat grazing most often supported E.
   fruticosa and L. involucrata, while the shrubs were relatively rare in
   burned areas. Utilizing the plant functional type framework in
   combination with field data to evaluate predictions of species
   occurrence among different disturbances regimes provides a strong
   theoretical basis for conservation strategies. Understanding which
   disturbance types favor a habitat of concern and the mechanisms by which
   they do so can aid the prioritization of areas for protection or the
   design of habitat management protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland birds are considered to be rapidly declining in North America.
   Management approaches for grassland birds frequently rely on prescribed
   burning to maintain habitat in suitable condition. We evaluated the
   relationships among years since burn, vegetation structure, and
   overwintering grassland bird abundance in coastal prairie. Le Conte's
   Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii) were most common in areas that had: (1)
   been burned within the previous 2 years, (2) medium density herbaceous
   vegetation, and (3) sparse shrub densities. Savannah Sparrows
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) were associated with areas: (1) burned
   within I year, (2) with sparse herbaceous vegetation, and (3) with
   sparse shrub densities. Sedge Wrens (Cistothorus platensis) were most
   common in areas that had: (1) burned greater than 2 years prior and (2)
   dense herbaceous vegetation. Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana): (1)
   were most common in areas of dense shrubs, (2) not related to time since
   burnings, and (3) demonstrated no relationship to herbaceous vegetation
   densities. The relationships to fire histories for all four bird species

   PHOENIX RapidFire fire behaviour simulator to compare fuel treatment
   strategies that meet the twin objectives of reducing wildfire risk to
   human settlements and a fire sensitive endangered species, the koala
   (Phascolarctos cinereus) in south-eastern Australia. The local koala
   population is in decline and a conservation management plan is being
   prepared to exclude wildfire for a 10-year period to assist with
   population recovery. Twelve scenarios developed by the land management
   agencies were compared using four indicators: wildfire size; burn
   probability; impact from exposure to fire; and treatment cost. Compared
   with the current risk setting, three treatment scenarios were found to
   reduce wildfire size and burn probability concurrently to both people
   and koalas. These strategies worked by increasing the landscape area
   treated, which came with increased financial cost. However, the impact
   from exposure to fire for both property and koala habitat remains high.
   Additional complementary strategies beyond landscape fuel reductions are
   needed to reduce impact from exposure in the event of a wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires in tropical forests are likely to become a more dominant
   disturbance due to future increasing feedbacks between rapid frontier
   expansion and more frequent droughts. This study evaluates the effects
   of fire recurrence on seasonally dry tropical forests of the Chiquitania
   region, located in the southern rim of Amazonia, eastern lowlands of
   Bolivia. Effects were assessed in terms of changes in biomass, forest
   structure, species diversity and composition. Forest plots were
   established in well-conserved study sites to compare unburnt forests
   with forests burned once, twice and three times in the period 2000-2012.
   Inventories were collected for trees, palms and lianas, including
   identification of species and measurement of morphological traits
   related to fire tolerance. Biomass was estimated using different
   allometric equations, and species composition, richness, abundance and
   dominance were compared. We found a significant loss in biomass, and
   putative effects on small and large trees after recurrent burns. The
   observed patterns in this study suggest that Chiquitano forests respond
   to recurrent fires through a shift in tree species composition with
   already-present fire-tolerant species becoming more dominant. This
   transition presented losses in biomass but increases in species
   richness. Insights into a possible transition to a more fire-adapted
   state is of great relevance for forest and fire management strategies in
   the region, as this transition may become irreversible in a future
   regime of more frequent wildfires, expected due to drier climatic
   conditions with increasing patterns of forest fragmentation and
   spreading use of fire into new forest frontiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

   Interactions of black grama (Bouteloua eripoda) and blue grama

   treatments of fire, simulated grazing and native herbivore activity than
   blue grama. Thus, new environmental conditions of wet or drought,
   changed fire regimes caused by increased grass fuel and altered patterns

Abstract = {{Fire is a prevalent feature of many landscapes and has numerous and
   complex effects on geological, hydrological, ecological, and economic
   systems. In some regions, the frequency and intensity of wildfire have
   increased in recent years and are projected to escalate with predicted
   climatic and landuse changes. In addition, prescribed burns continue to
   be used in many parts of the world to clear vegetation for development
   projects, encourage desired vegetation, and reduce fuel loads. Given the
   prevalence of fire on the landscape, authors of papers in this special
   series examine the complexities of fire as a disturbance shaping
   freshwater ecosystems and highlight the state of the science. These
   papers cover key aspects of fire effects that range from vegetation loss
   and recovery in watersheds to effects on hydrology and water quality
   with consequences for communities (from algae to fish), food webs, and
   ecosystem processes (e.g., organic matter subsidies, nutrient cycling)
   across a range of scales. The results presented in this special series
   of articles expand our knowledge of fire effects in different biomes,
   water bodies, and geographic regions, encompassing aquatic population,
   community, and ecosystem responses. In this overview, we summarize each
   paper and emphasize its contributions to knowledge on fire ecology and
   freshwater ecosystems. This overview concludes with a list of 7 research
   foci that are needed to further our knowledge of fire effects on aquatic
   ecosystems, including research on: 1) additional biomes and geographic
   regions; 2) additional habitats, including wetlands and lacustrine
   ecosystems; 3) different fire severities, sizes, and spatial
   configurations; and 4) additional response variables (e.g., ecosystem
   processes) 5) over long (> 5 y) time scales 6) with more rigorous study
   designs and data analyses, and 7) consideration of the effects of fire

   rainforest declines as the density of lantana increases. However, the
   saplings and seedlings and the soil seed bank of dry rainforest and

   build up of heavy fuel loads across the boundary of dry rainforest and

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is commonly used as a tool to meet a range of forest
   management goals. Owing to their limited movement abilities, terrestrial
   turtles are likely to be at high risk of injury and mortality, and to
   experience other fitness consequences with population-level implications
   from fire. Using radiotelemetry, we studied the responses of Eastern Box
   Turtles, Terrapene carolina carolina, to prescribed fire management in a
   sandhills Longleaf Pine forest system over a five-year period and
   compared our results to a nearby population in an unburned coastal plain
   location. Individual variation in turtle survival was strongly dependent
   on how frequently and extensively the areas were burned, with annual
   survival rates of 94.5\% in unburned areas decreasing to 45.9\% in the
   most extensively burned areas. Turtles at the fire-maintained sandhills
   site had annual survival rates 4.9\% less than at the unburned coastal
   plain site, and females had annual survival rates 6.8\% less than males.
   Survival varied seasonally, with greatest mortality rates in winter and
   spring, especially among females. Growth rates and body condition did
   not differ between sites, nor did they vary according to fire extent and
   frequency at the fire-maintained site. Although mortality was greater
   and spatially variable at the fire- maintained site, annual survival
   rates across the site (86-90\% for females and males, respectively) were
   comparable to other stable populations of T. carolina. The lesser than
   expected mortality rate at the fire-maintained site was likely the
   result of turtles' strong selection of mesic hardwood forests near
   bottomlands and streams - habitats that may serve as refugia from fire.
   In areas where T. carolina conservation is a priority, land managers
   should integrate maintenance of fire refuge habitats into burn planning
   to minimize unintended negative impacts to this imperiled species.}},

Abstract = {{Forest managers are setting Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in
   the southwestern United States on a trajectory toward a restored
   ecosystem by reducing tree densities and managing with prescribed fire.
   The process of restoration dramatically alters forest stands, and the
   effects of these changes on wildlife remain unclear. Our research
   evaluated which aspects of habitat alteration from restoration
   treatments may be affecting the habitat quality of Western Bluebird
   (Sialia mexicana), an insectivorous songbird whose populations are
   declining. Habitat loss resulting from fire-suppression activities may
   be partially responsible for their population declines; thus, the
   bluebird is a good representative species for assessing how the
   reconstruction of presuppression forest conditions can affect wildlife.
   We measured habitat variables at 63 successful and 19 unsuccessful
   Western Bluebird nests in 1999-2001 and 2003. We compared habitat models
   that represented bluebird biology and habitat changes from restoration.
   Two models of nest success that included (1) an increased herbaceous and
   bare ground cover and (2) increased Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii)
   densities and reduced Ponderosa pine densities were most supported by
   the data. Increased herbaceous ground cover and Gambel oak density
   likely represent improved invertebrate assemblages and thus improved
   forage abundance for nesting bluebirds. Lower Ponderosa pine densities
   may provide bluebirds with open perches from which to hunt and thereby
   improve the availability of invertebrates as a food source. We also
   provide a landscape-scale example of changes to bluebird habitat quality
   from treatments, which we recommend as a useful tool in restoration
   planning.}},

Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The biodiversity of the Cape Peninsula (49 127 ha in extent) has been
   considerably affected by various factors since European settlement in
   1652. Urbanization and agriculture have transformed 37\% of the original
   area of natural vegetation. Lowland vegetation types have been worst
   affected, with almost half of the transformation occurring in one of the
   15 recognized vegetation types. Vegetation at high altitudes has been
   little affected by urbanization and agriculture, but alien trees and
   shrubs are now threatening biodiversity in these areas. Of the area not
   affected by urbanization and agriculture 10.7\% is currently under dense
   stands (>25\% canopy cover) of alien plants and another 32.9\% is
   lightly invaded. Dense stands of Acacia cyclops, the most widespread
   invader, cover 2510 ha, 76\% of the total area under dense alien stands.
   This paper assesses the impacts of these factors on aspects of the plant
   biodiversity of the area, namely, the distribution of major vegetation
   types and of endemic, rare and threatened plant taxa and of taxa in the
   Proteaceae (a prominent element in almost all communities, taken as an
   indicator of overall plant biodiversity).
   Possible future impacts on biodiversity are assessed by considering the
   effects of several scenarios involving increased urbanization and
   changes to alien plant control strategies and further spread over the
   next 50-100 years. The worst-case scenario for urbanization sees the
   area under natural vegetation reduced to 12 163 ha (39.3\% of its extent
   in 1994, or 24.8\% of its original extent). Under this scenario almost a
   quarter of the 161 endemic, rare and threatened ('special') taxa are
   confined totally to urban areas; 57.4\% of the known localities of these
   taxa, and 40.1\% of the remaining localities of Proteaceae taxa are
   transformed. Dense alien stands currently affect 29.8\% of the
   localities of special taxa known from herbarium records and 8.4\% of
   these taxa currently occur only in areas at present affected by aliens.
   Clearing all dense stands would result in 62.9\% of special taxa having
   less than half of their known localities affected (49.1\% at present).
   Under this scenario, 92\% of Proteaceae taxa have more than 75\% of
   their localities unaffected by aliens. If clearing is confined to
   specific areas (the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment or all
   publicly-owned land) and the aliens spread further outside these areas,
   the area of natural vegetation remaining shrinks (to 82.4\% of the
   current extent if control is confined to public land). The further
   losses in biodiversity associated with these scenarios are described. If
   control programmes collapse and all potentially invadable land is
   occupied by dense alien stands, only 407 ha of natural vegetation would
   remain (1.5\% of the current extent).
   The probability of the various scenarios materializing is discussed. To
   minimize further losses in biodiversity it is essential that: (1) a
   major initiative is launched immediately to clear (firstly) the 10 184
   ha of lightly invaded vegetation and then the 3313 ha of densely invaded
   vegetation; (2) no urban development be permitted within the boundaries
   of the Cape Peninsula Protected Natural Environment; (3) a systematic
   programme of prescribed burning (linked to the alien control programme)
   is initiated; and (4) contingency measures are implemented to improve
   the status of seriously threatened taxa, habitats and vegetation types.}},

   wildlife habitat components including snags of varying sizes and the
   availability of a woody shrub layer; and 2) compare the individual
   performance of the Landsat and lidar datasets for predicting the
   distributions of these difficult to map forest habitat features Using
   164 field calibration plots and remote sensing predictors, we modeled
   and mapped the distributions of our response variables including snag
   classes (dbh >= 40 cm; >= 50 cm, and >= 75 cm) and woody shrub cover
   thresholds (>= 30 and >= 50\% cover) at 10 m resolutions. Remote sensing
   predictors included various lidar structure and topography variables and
   Landsat time series products representing the pre-fire forest,
   disturbance magnitude, and current forest condition. A model was chosen
   for mapping purposes using AIC model selection and then by comparing
   leave-one-out-cross-validation error matrices to choose among competing
   models. We were able to predict and map all response variables with
   moderate accuracies and variable sensitivity (true positive) and
   specificity (true negative) rates. All snag and shrub models were
   considered to have ``good{''} predictive performance as indicated by
   area under the curve values (0.74-0.91), with percent correctly
   classified values ranging from 69-85\% when a probability threshold is
   chosen that balances false positive and false negative errors. Landsat
   models performed marginally better than lidar structure models according
   to classification statistics. Landsat-only models had slightly less
   accuracy than models that included lidar and Landsat data, but often
   with greater errors than the combined model. The ability to map the
   response variables with moderate errors and acceptable accuracies for
   many applications was through the fusion of these remote sensing
   datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Snags are standing dead trees that are an important component in the
   nesting habitat of birds and other species. Although snag availability
   is believed to limit populations in managed and non-managed forests,
   little data are available to evaluate the relative effect of stand
   conditions and management on snag occurrence. We analyzed point sample
   data from an intensive forest inventory within an 80,000 ha landscape
   for four major forest types to support the hypotheses that routine
   low-intensity prescribed fire would increase, and thinning would
   decrease, snag occurrence. We employed path analysis to define a priori
   causal relationships to determine the direct and indirect effects of
   site quality, age, relative stand density index and fire for all forest
   types and thinning effects for loblolly pine and longleaf pine. Stand
   age was an important direct effect for loblolly pine, mixed
   pine-hardwoods and hardwoods, but not for longleaf pine. Snag occurrence
   in loblolly pine was increased by prescribed fire and decreased by
   thinning which confirmed our initial hypotheses. Although fire was not
   important in mixed pine-hardwoods, it was for hardwoods but the
   relationship depended on site quality. For longleaf pine the relative
   stand density index was the dominant variable affecting snag occurrence,
   which increased as the density index decreased. Site quality, age and
   thinning had significant indirect effects on snag occurrence in longleaf
   pine through their effects on the density index. Although age is an
   important condition affecting snag occurrence for most forest types,
   path analysis revealed that fire and density management practices within
   certain forest types can also have major beneficial effects,
   particularly in stands less than 60 years old. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Boreal Caribou Can Coexist with Natural but Not Industrial Disturbances}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{For species at risk, it is important that demographic models be
   consistent with our most recent knowledge because alternate model
   versions can have differing predictions for wildlife and natural
   resource management. To establish and maintain this consistency, we can
   compare predicted model values to current or past observations and
   demographic knowledge. When novel predictor information becomes
   available, testing for consistency between modeled and observed values
   ensures the best models are used for robust, evidence-based, wildlife
   management. We combine novel information on the extent of historical
   disturbance regimes (industrial and fire) to an existing demographic
   model and predict historical and projected demographics of woodland
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Exploring 6 simulation experiments
   across 5 populations in Alberta, Canada, we identify the relative
   importance of industrial disturbance, fire, and population density to
   observed population size and growth rate. We confirm the onset of
   significant declines across all 5 populations began approximately 30
   years ago, demonstrate these declines have been consistent, and conclude
   they are more likely due to industrial disturbance from the oil and gas
   sector within contemporary population ranges than historical fire
   regimes. These findings reinforce recent research on the cause of
   woodland caribou declines. Testing for consistency between observations
   and models prescribed for species recovery is paramount for assessing
   the cause of declines, projecting population trends, and refining
   recovery strategies for effective wildlife management. We provide a
   novel simulation method for conducting these tests. (c) 2020 The

Title = {{Do feral buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) explain the increase of woody cover
   in savannas of Kakadu National Park, Australia?}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim To study changes in woody vegetation in both floodplains and
   eucalypt savanna over a 40-year period using multi-temporal spatial
   analysis of variation in density of a large introduced herbivore, the
   Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Feral buffalo built up to high
   densities in the study area until c. 1985, after which a control
   programme almost eliminated the animals. From 1990, low densities of
   managed buffalo were maintained inside an enclosure. We compared trends
   in woody vegetation when buffalo were high-density feral, low-density
   managed or absent.
   Location The study area was located in and around a 116-km(2) buffalo
   enclosure inside Kakadu National Park, in monsoonal northern Australia.
   Methods We analysed sequences of digitized and geo-rectified aerial
   photographs, acquired in 1964, 1975, 1984, 1991 and 2004, to chart
   changes in woody cover on the floodplain and in the savanna. On the
   floodplain we assessed whether trees were present at these times at
   14,568 points, and buffalo density was estimated from the density of
   animal tracks. In the savanna we estimated woody cover at pre-selected
   sites. Generalized linear modelling was used to analyse changes in woody
   vegetation, using elevation and presence of woody vegetation in
   neighbouring points on the floodplain, and buffalo regime and initial
   woody cover in the savanna.
   Results Changes in animal track density reflected park-wide historical
   estimates of buffalo numbers. Tree cover increased in both floodplain
   and savanna, but this was only weakly related to buffalo density. The
   best predictor of whether a floodplain cell converted from treeless to
   woody, or the converse, was the woodiness of neighbouring vegetation.
   There was slightly less thickening with high buffalo densities. In
   savanna, low densities of managed buffalo were weakly associated with
   increases in tree cover relative to either high densities of feral
   buffalo or no buffalo.
   Main Conclusions Our study indicates that buffalo are not a major driver
   of floodplain and eucalypt savanna dynamics. Rather, the observed
   increase in woody cover in both savanna and flood plains concords with
   regional trends and may be related to increased atmospheric CO(2),
   increasing rainfall and changing fire regimes during the study period.}},

Title = {{Effect of long-term understory prescribed burning on standing and down
   dead woody material in dry upland oak forests}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{291}},

Abstract = {{Dead woody material, long ignored or viewed as a nuisance for forest
   management, has gained appreciation for its many roles in the forest
   including wildlife habitat, nutrient storage and cycling, energy for
   trophic webs, protection of soil, fuel for fire and carbon storage. The
   growing interest in managing dead woody material has created strong
   demand for greater understanding of factors controlling amounts and
   turnover. Prescribed burning, an important management tool, may have
   strong effects of dead woody material given fire's capacity to create
   and consume dead woody material. We determined effects of long-term
   understory prescribed burning on standing and down woody material in
   upland oak forests in south-central North America. We hypothesized that
   as frequency of fire increased in these stands the amount of deadwood
   would decrease and the fine woody material would decrease more rapidly
   than coarse woody material. The study was conducted in forests dominated
   by post oak (Quercus stellata) and blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica)
   in wildlife management areas where understory prescribed burning had
   been practiced for over 20 years and the range of burn frequencies was 0
   (unburned) fires per decade (FPD) to 4.6 FPD. The amount of deadwood was
   low compared with more productive forests in southeastern North America.
   The biomass (24.7 Mg ha(-1)) and carbon stocks (11.7 Mg ha(-1)) were
   distributed among standing dead (22\%), coarse woody debris (CWD, dia.
   >7.5 cm., 12\%), fine woody debris (FWD, dia. <= 7.5 cm., 23\%), and
   forest floor (43\%). There was no evidence that understory prescribed
   burning influenced the amount and size distribution of standing and down
   dead woody material. There were two explanations for the lack of a
   detectable effect. First, a high incidence of severe weather including
   ice storms and strong winds that produce large amounts of deadwood
   intermittently in an irregular pattern across the landscape may preclude
   detecting a strong effect of understory prescribed burning. Second, fire
   suppression during the first one-half of the 20th Century may have led
   to encroachment of woody plants into forest gaps and savannas creating a
   patchwork of young and old stands that produced deadwood of different
   sizes and at different rates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a global phenomenon that plays a vital role in regulating

   Fire managers are charged with balancing the short-term protection of
   human assets sensitive to fire exposure against the potential long-term
   benefits that wildfires can provide to natural systems and wildlife
   populations. The compressed decision timeframes imposed on fire managers
   during an incident are often insufficient to fully assess a range of
   fire management options and their respective implications for public and
   fire responder safety, attainment of land and resource objectives, and
   future trajectories of hazard and risk. This paper reviews the role of
   GIS-based assessment and planning to support operational wildfire
   management decisions, with a focus on recent and emerging research that
   pre-identifies anthropogenic and biophysical landscape features that can
   be leveraged to increase the safety and effectiveness of wildfire

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fire weather forecasts are used by land and wildlife managers to
   determine when meteorological and fuel conditions are suitable to
   conduct prescribed burning. In this work, we investigate the sensitivity
   of ambient PM2.5 to various fire and meteorological variables in a
   spatial setting that is typical for the southeastern US, where
   prescribed fires are the single largest source of fine particulate
   matter. We use the method of principle components regression to estimate
   sensitivity of PM2.5, measured at a monitoring site in Jacksonville, NC
   (JVL), to fire data and observed and forecast meteorological variables.
   Fire data were gathered from prescribed fire activity used for
   ecological management at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, extending 10-50
   km south from the PM2.5 monitor. Principal components analysis (PCA) was
   run on 10 data sets that included acres of prescribed burning activity
   (PB) along with meteorological forecast data alone or in combination
   with observations. For each data set, observed PM2.5 (unitless) was
   regressed against PCA scores from the first seven principal components
   (explaining at least 80\% of total variance). PM2.5 showed significant
   sensitivity to PB: 3.6 +/- 2.2 mu g m(-3) per 1000 acres burned at the
   investigated distance scale of 10-50 km. Applying this sensitivity to
   the available activity data revealed a prescribed burning source
   contribution to measured PM2.5 of up to 25\% on a given day. PM2.5
   showed a positive sensitivity to relative humidity and temperature, and
   was also sensitive to wind direction, indicating the capture of more
   regional aerosol processing and transport effects. As expected, PM2.5
   had a negative sensitivity to dispersive variables but only showed a
   statistically significant negative sensitivity to ventilation rate,
   highlighting the importance of this parameter to fire managers. A
   positive sensitivity to forecast precipitation was found, consistent
   with the practice of conducting prescribed burning on days when rain can
   naturally extinguish fires. Perhaps most importantly for land managers,
   our analysis suggests that instead of relying on the forecasts from a
   day before, prescribed burning decisions should be based on the
   forecasts released the morning of the burn when possible, since these
   data were more stable and yielded more statistically robust results. (C)

Abstract = {{Root-feeding beetles, including several species of Hylastes Erichson
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Hylurgops LeConte (Coleoptera:

   LeConte (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Pissodes Germar (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae), and Steremnius Schonherr (Coleoptera: Curculionidae),
   have emerged as serious problems in conifer plantations and forests in
   the United States and Canada in recent decades. Root-feeding beetles are
   particularly associated with stressed, diseased, or injured trees.
   Emerging adults kill seedlings by girdling them at the root collar and
   kill older trees, at least in the North and West, by transmitting fungal
   root pathogens in the genus Leptographium Lagerberg \& Melin
   (Ophiostomatales: Ophiostomataceae). In the South seedling, mortality
   can be as high as 60\% for seedlings planted in winter following fall
   harvest. For stands harvested after 1 July, planting should be delayed a
   full year. Broadcast insecticides can be used, but dipping seedlings in
   0.75\% permethrin prior to planting and physical barriers to feeding
   have proven effective. However, an integrated pest management approach
   that emphasizes a combination of measures to minimize attraction of
   beetles and to maintain health of host trees is recommended. Shelterwood
   harvest and soil scarification can create site conditions that minimize
   attraction of root beetles. Precommercial thinning and prescribed fire
   are often used to reduce tree competition and reduce vulnerability to
   stem-colonizing bark beetles. However, root beetles are attracted to
   thinned or burned stands, for at least 6-7 mo. Therefore, thinning
   should be avoided in areas of high risk for root disease transmission
   or, when necessary, thinning should be implemented during June or July
   following beetle dispersal in May. Semiochemicals can be used to monitor
   abundances of root beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem restoration provides unique opportunities to study community
   dynamics under succession and can reveal how consumer communities
   re-assemble and respond to successional changes. Studying community
   dynamics from both taxonomic and functional trait perspectives also may
   provide more robust assessments of restoration progress or success and
   allow cross-system comparisons. We studied ground beetle (Coleoptera:
   Carabidae) communities for three years in a restored grassland
   chronosequence with sites from 0 to 28 years old. We measured
   traditional community metrics (abundance, richness, Shannon diversity)
   and functional trait metrics based on species' body length, wing
   morphology, activity time, phenology, and diet. Communities had high
   species richness and abundance in early successional stages, but these
   declined in later stages to low levels comparable to an adjacent
   grassland remnant. Species composition also shifted with time,
   converging with the remnant. Although functional richness, like species
   richness, declined as succession progressed, functional divergence
   quickly increased and was maintained over time, suggesting niche
   differentiation in established communities. Young sites were typified by
   small, macropterous, phytophagous species, while older sites contained
   larger species more likely to be flightless and carnivorous. Prescribed
   burns also affected traits, decreasing prevalence of larger species.
   This study demonstrates that functionally diverse consumer communities
   can self-assemble under restoration practices. In a relatively short
   amount of time both morphological and trophic level diversity are
   established. However, prescribed fire intended to control non-desirable
   plants may also shape beetle community functional composition, and
   restoration managers should consider if plant community benefits of fire
   outweigh potential declines in consumer function.}},

   understand what factors were associated with spatial patterns of habitat
   use by Elliot's short-tailed shrews (Blarina hylophaga Elliot, 1899) in
   tallgrass prairie. Our modeling efforts were based on 20 years
   (1981-2000) of presence-absence data for shrews at each of 20 stations
   (local site) along 14 permanent traplines on Konza Prairie Biological
   Station, Kansas, USA. A logistic model accurately predicted the presence
   of short-tailed shrews at a local site. Probability of shrew occurrence
   decreased as amount of precipitation decreased, slope steepness
   increased, grazing increased, or burned area within 500 m of a local
   site increased. However, when amount of precipitation was low, area
   burned was high, or grazing occurred, shrews were uncommon and responded
   little to the other variables. Numbers of shrews were negatively related
   only to numbers of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)), a
   mouse that selects burned and grazed habitats that shrews avoid. Our
   observations suggest that multiple environmental factors limit use of

Abstract = {{In the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon, quaking aspen is on the
   western fringe of its range. It exists as small, scattered, remnant
   stands of rapidly declining trees. Although little is known about the
   historic distribution of aspen in Oregon, it is believed that stands
   were once larger and more widely distributed. Decline of the species is
   attributed to fire suppression and browsing pressure from large
   ungulates. A landscape approach to restoring aspen is taken using a
   variety of techniques. Among these are construction of large herbivore
   exclosures, prescribed fire, establishment of new aspen stands using

Abstract = {{Coarse woody debris (CWD) is being actively managed in many Pacific
   Northwest forest ecosystems because of its ecological importance. This
   paper discusses: (1) the source, amount and type of CWD present in
   ecosystems relative to their fire regime, (2) decomposition rates of
   CWD, (3) relationships among invertebrates, fungi and fire in the
   decomposition process, (4) nutrient dynamics in CWD, and (5) management
   of CWD. Amounts of CWD have decreased as a result of forest management
   west of the Cascade crest, but increased in the drier areas east of the
   Cascade crest as a result of fire suppression, defoliator and bark
   beetle attacks and diseases. Logs decay slowly, but this depends on
   their species and size and the environmental conditions. Coarse woody
   debris provides a considerable amount of soil organic matter, but lower
   amounts of nutrients. However, it can be both a source and sink for
   nitrogen. Invertebrates and fungi are intimately related in the
   decomposition process and CWD is a source of ecosystem biodiversity.
   Understanding the natural ecology of CWD in various ecosystems is
   important in determining how much CWD to leave and recruit. Long-term
   field experiments and simulation modeling efforts are being conducted to
   determine the role of CWD in ecosystem sustainability and in maintaining
   long-term productivity.}},

Abstract = {{In 1985 new silvicultural prescriptions for managing jarrah ( Eucalyptus
   marginata) forest in south- west Western Australia came into operation.
   The most extreme logging treatment ( gap release) involved removal of
   most of the overstorey from patches no larger than 10 ha, followed by a
   regeneration fire. In the other logging treatment ( shelterwood), less
   wood was removed from a larger area, also followed by a fire. This study
   examined the impact of these disturbances on the avifauna by monitoring
   species richness and abundance of birds one year before logging, one
   year before burning, and for five years after burning. Although 68 bird
   species were recorded during the seven years of the study, 29 of these
   were detected fewer than 15 times. Of the other 39 bird species
   recorded, only two ( Gerygone fusca and Acanthiza apicalis) showed a
   statistically significant treatment effect over time on their abundance.
   The abundance of G. fusca initially declined in the disturbed treatments
   and by Year 7 of the study ( 5 years post-fire) in the gap-release
   treatment had not recovered its original abundance. A. apicalis
   increased its abundance in both shelterwood and gap-release treatments.
   By Year 7, both species in the logged treatments had abundances similar
   to those in the unlogged treatments. Total abundance of all species
   varied little across treatments. Species richness was highest by Year 7
   in the shelterwood and lowest in the gap-release treatment. In some
   years community structure varied more at the external-reference sites (
   not recently logged or burnt) than at the gap-release sites. In
   particular, there was little overlap in community structure in the
   external-reference treatment between the first and final years, whereas
   the pre-logging and final year in the gap-release treatment showed a
   high degree of overlap. These differences are suggestive of overriding
   short-term annual variation in broad-scale factors rather than local
   factors. Yearly variation in rainfall and temperature was documented;
   during low rainfall periods, populations of foliage arthropods may have
   been reduced.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fully appreciate the role that fire, both natural and
   anthropogenic, had in shaping pre-Euro-American settlement landscapes in
   the Pacific Northwest (PNW), it is necessary to develop a more robust
   method of evaluating paleofire reconstructions. Here we demonstrate an
   approach that includes the identification of charcoal morphotypes (i.e.
   visually distinct charcoal particles), and incorporates both
   paleoecological and archaeological data sets, to more specifically
   determine both the nature of past fire regimes (i.e. fuel type and fire
   severity) and the likely ignition source of those fires. We demonstrate
   the usefulness of this approach by reconstructing the late Holocene fire
   and vegetation histories of Lake Oswego (Clackamas County), Oregon, and
   Fish Lake (Okanogan County), Washington, using macroscopic charcoal and
   pollen analysis of sediment cores. The histories were compared with
   climatic records from the PNW as well as archaeological, ethnographic,
   and historical records from the Lower Columbia River Valley and Southern
   Columbia Plateau cultural regions. Our results indicate that while
   centennial-to-millennial-scale climate change had limited influence on
   the fire regimes at the study sites during the past approximate to 3800
   years, the use of fire by Native Americans for a variety of reasons,
   particularly after ca. 1200 calendar years before present (AD 750), had
   a far greater impact. Charcoal morphotype ratios also indicate that
   fires in the two watersheds were fundamentally different in their
   severity and impact, and led to major shifts in the forests and
   woodlands surrounding Lake Oswego, but helped maintain the ponderosa
   pine-dominated forest at Fish Lake. The elimination of fire from the two
   study sites during the past 100-300 years is likely the combined result
   of Euro-American contact and the arrival of disease in the PNW, as well
   as 20th-century fire suppression and grazing effects on fuel continuity,
   which has implications for future forest management and restoration
   efforts in the PNW.}},

Abstract = {{Africa is often referred to as the Fire Continent, and fire is
   recognised as a natural factor of the environment due to the prevalence
   of lightning storms and an ideal fire climate in the less arid regions
   with seasonal drought. On a global scale, the most extensive areas of
   tropical savanna, characterized by a grassy under stories that become
   extremely flammable during the dry season, occur in Africa. The use of
   fire in Africa to manage vegetation for domestic livestock and
   indigenous wildlife is widely recognized by both commercial and communal
   land users. Research on the effects of fire has been conducted
   throughout the grassland and savanna areas since the early twentieth
   century, resulting in the development of effective and practical
   guidelines for prescribed burning for domestic livestock and wildlife
   management systems. Generally, the reasons for prescribed burning in
   Africa are similar for both commercial and communal land users, namely,
   to remove moribund and or unacceptable plant material and to control the
   encroachment of undesirable plants negatively affecting domestic
   livestock and wildlife. In addition, commercial operators use fire to
   manage wildlife conservation areas. Prescribed burning to control ticks
   is also widely used in communal communities but is generally not
   recognised in commercial livestock enterprises. However, research has
   shown that tick populations can be reduced using fire to alter the
   micro-habitat for these organisms. Until recently, commercial and
   communal land users held differing views on the appropriate season for
   prescribed burning, with the former igniting fires shortly after the
   first spring rains and the latter burning throughout the dry winter
   period. Subsequent research has shown that both seasons of burn have
   similar effects; the key requirement being that the grass sward is
   dormant at the time of burning to minimise the negative effects on the
   vegetation. A valuable tentative comparison has been made between fire
   management practices applied by commercial land users and communal land
   users, and provides an exciting opportunity for further and essential
   research to be conducted to gain greater insight into how communal
   African communities use fire. Based on extensive experience, my aim is
   to provide a personal perspective on the use of fire by commercial and
   communal land users for managing rangelands in southern and east African
   regions of the continent.}},

Abstract = {{The world's forests are highly fragmented by linear disturbances, and
   many forests have failed to recover decades after abandonment. Lack of
   recovery is common in unproductive forests, such as treed peatlands,
   because of conditions that limit tree growth, including simplification
   of microtopography (loss of microsites). The persistence of these
   features affects biodiversity, but of particular concern in Canada is
   the detrimental effects on threatened woodland caribou. Although natural
   regeneration of trees in peatlands occurs in some places, it is not an
   effective recovery strategy for restoring the habitat of woodland
   caribou. This has led to restoration activities with costs exceeding
   CAD\$12 500/km. However, current restoration does not consider
   wildfires, which can destroy planted trees but also initiate early seral
   conditions that favor natural regeneration. Here we compared tree
   regeneration on seismic lines and adjacent forest controls for burnt (75
   sites) and unburnt (68 sites) treed peatlands in northeast Alberta,
   Canada. Tree regeneration (stems with a DBH < 1 cm/ha) varied from 28
   500 in burnt lines, 11 440 in unburnt lines, and 18 210 in burnt forest,
   to 9520 in unburnt forest. Wildfires promoted denser regeneration in
   sites with a greater proportion of serotinous species and water table
   depth. Microtopography and terrain wetness explained regeneration on
   burnt lines, but not unburnt lines. In burnt and unburnt lines,
   sunlight, microtopography, and depth of water table most affected tree
   regeneration patterns.}},

Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{113-152}},
Abstract = {{We summarize the effects of major weather events such as ice storms,
   wind storms, and flooding on the abundance and diversity of terrestrial
   forest insects and their allies. This synthesis indicates that weather
   events influence both spatial and temporal patterns of forests and
   insect communities in North American landscapes: The Atlantic and
   Pacific oceanic sides of the continent are relatively more susceptible
   to ice and wind storms, respectively. There have been more studies and
   reports on the responses of forest insects to wind storms, and on
   economically important subcortical insects than on gall-forming,
   foliage-feeding; fungal-feeding, litter-dwelling, pollinating,
   parasitizing, predaceous, root-feeding, and sap-feeding insects. Weather
   events positively affect populations of subcortical insect species, and
   impact their colonization patterns and dynamics. Species belonging to
   genera such as Dendroctonus (Scolytidae) and Monochamus (Cerambycidae)
   may sometimes cause economic damage by colonizing residual live tree,
   and dead trees, rendering the wood unsalvageable. Subsequent outbreaks
   of spruce beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby) and Douglas-fir
   beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, have been frequently
   documented in western North American forests following wind events. Wind
   disturbances have also been observed to accelerate the life-cycles of D.
   rufipennis and Semanotus litigiosus (Casey) (Cerambycidae), and in rare
   instances, have caused Monochamus spp. to become primary colonizers.
   Populations of other important subcortical species have not always
   increased dramatically following weather events. Foliage- and
   pollen-feeding insects may experience mortality directly from a weather
   event or indirectly through habitat alteration. In some cases, forest
   insects may use storms to migrate to new habitats. Populations of
   open-habitat and forest specialist litter-dwelling species have
   increased and decreased, respectively, subsequent to weather events.
   Forest specialist species generally rebound within a short period of
   time, suggesting that they are adapted to these periodic weather events.
   Little is known about the combined effects of post-weather-disturbance
   management practices such as salvage-logging and prescribed-burning on
   insects in North American forests.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation status of Cycas seemannii, native to Vanuatu, New
   Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga, is assessed based on isozyme analysis,
   abundance estimates and factors affecting the survival of the species.
   Genetic variation in the species is low and genetic differentiation
   between populations is high, as compared to plants in general and to
   other cycads. Lower genetic variation was detected in a fragmented
   population as compared to less disturbed populations. Low gene flow was
   also detected, implying little contact between the various populations.
   A conservative estimate of 17,000 individuals remaining in the wild was
   obtained, with more than half of these located on the islands of
   Vanuatu. Accounts of past abundance suggest declining population sizes,
   most likely the result of repeated burning. Other factors that may be
   contributing to the decline are decreasing importance to and protection
   by humans, habitat alteration for agricultural and developmental
   purposes, and poor dispersal and recolonisation potential. An assessment
   based on the present estimated abundance and what is known of recent
   declines in numbers, indicates that the species should be categorised as
   Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. On some of the densely populated
   islands, such as Viti Levu in Fiji and Nukualofa in Tonga, the species
   is locally Endangered or Critically Endangered. Possible conservation
   measures are suggested, and it is emphasised that populations on
   different islands must be considered separately because of their genetic
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Both disturbance history and previous land use influence present-day
   vegetation and soils. These influences can have important implications
   for conservation of plant communities if former disturbance and land use
   change species abundances, increase colonization of nonnative plant
   species or if they alter soil characteristics in ways that make them
   less suitable for species of conservation interest. We compared the
   plant species composition, the proportion of native and normative plant
   species, and soil biogeochemical characteristics across seven dominant
   land use and vegetation cover types on the outwash sandplain of Martha's
   Vineyard that differed in previous soil tillage, dominant overstory
   vegetation and history of recent prescribed fire. The outwash sandplain
   supports many native plant species adapted to dry, low nutrient
   conditions and maintenance of native species is a management concern.
   There was broad overlap in the plant species composition among pine
   (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus) plantations on untilled soils, pine
   plantations on formerly tilled soils, scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia)
   shrublands, tree oak (Q. velutina, Q. alba) woodlands, burned tree oak
   woodlands, and sandplain grasslands. All of these land cover categories
   contained few nonnative species. In contrast, agricultural grasslands
   had high richness and cover of normative plants. Soil characteristics
   were also similar among all of the woodland, shrubland and grassland
   land cover categories, but soils in agricultural grasslands had higher
   pH, extractable Ca2+ and Mg2+ in mineral soils and higher rates of net
   nitrification. The similarity of soils and significant overlap in
   vegetation across pine plantations, scrub oak shrublands, oak woodlands
   and sandplain grasslands suggests that the history of land use, current
   vegetation and soil characteristics do not pose a major barrier to
   management strategies that would involve conversion among any of these
   vegetation types. The current presence of high cover of normative
   species and nutrient-enriched soils in agricultural grasslands, however,
   may pose a barrier to expansion of sandplain grasslands or shrublands on
   these former agricultural lands if native species are not able to
   outcompete normative species in these anthropogenically-enriched sites.

   suffered less herbivore pressure than did non insecticide treated

   growth, and specific leaf mass were greatest on once-burned sites,

Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: To restore and manage fire-adapted forest communities in the
   central Appalachians, USA, land managers are now increasingly
   prioritizing use of prescribed fire. However, it is unclear how the
   reintroduction of fire following decades of suppression will affect bat
   communities, particularly where white-nose syndrome-related population
   declines of many cave-hibernating bat species have occurred. To address
   this concern, we monitored and compared bat activity in burned and
   unburned habitat across a temporal gradient in western Virginia.
   Results: We found evidence for slightly positive fire effects on
   activity levels of the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis
   {[}Trouessart, 1897]), Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis {[}Miller and Allen,
   1928]), little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus {[}Le Conte, 1831]), big
   brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus {[}Palisot de Beauvois, 1796])/silver-haired
   bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans {[}Le Conte, 1831]) group, all
   high-frequency bats, and all bat species combined. We observed temporal
   effects only for the big brown bat, with a negative relationship between
   activity and time since fire.
   Conclusion: Because response of bat activity was neutral to weakly
   positive relative to burned forest condition, our results suggest that
   bats are not a resource that would impede the use of this management
   tool in the central Appalachians.}},

Abstract = {{Due to fire suppression and land use changes, Missouri glade habitats
   have undergone long-term declines in area and function leading to
   consequent declines in many bird species that rely on these habitats. We
   examined breeding bird species composition and vegetation community
   composition on three glade sites undergoing restoration with prescribed
   tire and compared them to three unburned glade sites and three unburned
   forest sites. Although we documented subtle changes in vegetation
   characteristics in response to prescribed fire, important structural
   characteristics, such as canopy cover (>55\% at all study sites) and
   grass cover (<10\% at all study sites) remain outside ranges used to
   characterize glades. Despite this, bird community structure shifted
   towards grass-shrubland (glade) birds (e.g., prairie warbler (Dendroica
   discolor), blue-winged warbler (Vermivora pinus), yellow-breasted chat
   (Icteria virens)) in glades that had been managed with prescribed tire.
   Using canonical correspondence analyses and stepwise forward logistic
   regression, we found that grass-shrubland (glade) birds were associated
   with habitat characteristics such as high stem density of small (0-6.3
   cm diameter at breast height) trees, greater herbaceous cover, greater
   rock cover and a more open canopy. However, we did not detect any bird
   species historically associated with glades, such as Bachman's sparrow
   (Aimophila aestivalis) or field sparrow (Spizella pusilla) on any study
   sites but did frequently detect red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceous) on
   all sites. Short term application of prescribed fire has not yet
   produced functionally restored glades. Long term applications of
   prescribed fire, used in conjunction with mechanical and/or chemical
   removal of woody overstory, are necessary to achieve restoration at
   these sites.}},

Abstract = {{Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) calculated that 55\% of
   Saskatchewan's Boreal Shield has been disturbed by wildfire in the last
   40 years. The 2012 Canadian Federal Recovery Strategy for woodland
   caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) states that these
   large-scale natural disturbances can cause caribou to cease use of
   portions of their range. This assumption neglects the potential habitat
   value of postfire residuals. We tested this assumption using 2 years of
   GPS data obtained from 56 female caribou to identify calving site
   selection. Seventy-nine calving events were identified from 91
   individual calving seasons. For both calving and postcalving periods,
   woodland caribou preferred nonburned (>40 years) over burned habitats
   (<= 40 years). Within burned areas, residual patches dominated by
   bogs-fens were preferred, indicating that burns with residuals are
   important woodland caribou calving habitat. The residuals may act as
   island refuges providing food-security, while surrounding burns provide
   reduced visual obstruction from which caribou can detect approaching
   predators. Although more data are necessary to make robust conclusions,
   this study provides novel insight into the ecological interactions of
   forest fires with woodland caribou in northern Saskatchewan, and offers
   important considerations regarding critical habitat identification and
   range-level planning to ensure all suitable caribou habitats are
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland
   clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland
   Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance
   over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing
   impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp
   management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this
   situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and
   uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by
   the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird
   species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared
   areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared
   woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to
   woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined
   significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically
   aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness
   increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners.
   This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to
   a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual
   bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level
   abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one
   variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall
   gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This
   study suggests that priorities for conservation management include:
   cessation of broad-scale clearing; increased protection for regrowth
   (particularly where this may bolster connectivity and/or size of
   woodland fragments); control of miners; maintenance of fallen woody
   debris in woodlands; increase in fire frequency; and reduction in the
   incidence of grazing and exotic pasture grass.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland eutrophication increases the susceptibility of native
   communities to invasion by opportunistic plant species, which then
   commonly form monotypic stands. Wetland aquatic fauna are negatively
   affected by associated changes of eutrophication in the physiochemical
   environment, habitat structural complexity and ecological interactions.
   In addition to reducing external nutrient loads, it is predicted that
   efforts that reduce the resilience of the altered ecosystem are required
   to accelerate ecosystem recovery. We assessed small fish and decapod
   crustacean responses to a 3-year ecosystem scale experiment that tested
   the effectiveness of chemical treatment and controlled burning as a
   management strategy to accelerate the recovery of eutrophic Everglades
   marsh. The management strategy resulted in the removal, on average, of
   91\% and 81\% of the emergent macrophyte cover in two regions differing
   in enrichment effects. The resulting open-water habitats were
   characterised by higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, greater
   periphyton and submersed aquatic vegetation and increased structural
   complexity. The average combined density and biomass of small fish and
   decapod crustaceans did not differ significantly between dense emergent
   vegetation and created openings but regional and water year differences
   occurred. More importantly, community composition did differ between
   treatments, with the crayfish Procambarus fallax dominating in dense
   vegetation and small fish Gambusia holbrooki, Jordanella floridae and
   Poecilia latipinna and grass shrimp Palaemonetes paludosus dominating in
   open water. We compared the whole body carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) contents (\%) and C:N:P stoichiometry among small fish
   and decapod crustaceans. Fish had greater whole body C and P contents
   (low C:P) compared with the two crustaceans. While the management action
   did not alter the quantity (mgcarbonm-2) or energy (kcalm-2) of fauna,
   the resultant shift in composition was coincident with an increase in
   the nutrient quality (mgPm-2 and low C:P) of fauna. Faunal community
   composition of the created open-water habitats in the eutrophic
   Everglades was similar to the oligotrophic Everglades; however, density
   and biomass were significantly lower for the oligotrophic region.
   Moreover, intraspecific comparisons showed that small fish and decapod
   crustaceans from the oligotrophic region were smaller and had lower
   whole body phosphorus contents than organisms from eutrophic regions.
   This suggests that phosphorus limitation in the Everglades extends
   beyond autotrophs to include consumers. The high density of emergent
   macrophytes typically formed in eutrophic wetlands creates a physical
   barrier to predators, limiting the trophic transfer of energy. The
   combination of burning and chemical treatment not only maintained the
   abundance and biomass of aquatic fauna, but produced a compositional
   shift towards higher quality prey for wading birds and predatory fishes.
   We recognise that the contrasting nature between the created openings in
   the eutrophic and oligotrophic Everglades highlights major structural
   and functional differences in natural sloughs versus enriched created
   sloughs', but we suggest that active management efforts to accelerate
   the recovery of P-impacted regions could provide temporary benefits to
   Everglades wildlife by improving access to abundant, high-quality prey.}},

Abstract = {{The predicted increase in wildfires associated with climate change poses
   a risk to freshwater biodiversity that may be exacerbated by river
   regulation. We studied the effects of wildfire and river management on
   the fish assemblages of Atlantic-Mediterranean streams in northern
   Portugal. Employing a chronosquence survey covering an 18-year gradient
   of impact-recovery from major fire events (ca. 100\% catchment burnt),
   we assessed the ecological response with respect to time since wildfire,
   interpreting fish assemblages in the context of species traits and
   characteristics of the river habitat. Non-burnt sites (N = 18; surveyed
   4 years previously) were compared to burnt sites (N = 14), two of which
   were part of the non-burnt set, thus providing a Before-After Impact
   comparison (BAI; N = 2). Across burnt sites richness and abundance were
   not related to time since wildfire. BAI revealed a contrast in the
   response of different species that corresponded to descriptive evidence
   from the chronosequence of burnt sites. As resource specialists, Salmo
   trutta were negatively impacted by wildfire; Iberian endemic cyprinids,
   characterized by generalist traits, demonstrated resistance. Habitat
   structure was a key determinant of wildfire-impact, increasing with
   channel slope and the degree of channelization. The low abundance of
   migratory taxa (S. trutta and Anguilla anguilla) at burnt sites
   suggested the importance of fish mobility to post-fire recovery. These
   data demonstrate that trait profiles and habitat descriptions provide
   pragmatic information for the management of rivers in fire-susceptible
   regions and suggest that the rehabilitation of these upland stream
   habitats might enhance ecological resistance and resilience to catchment
   wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Concern for viable spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) populations has
   played prominently in the management of western forests in the United
   States. Historically, much of the debate has focused on the impacts of
   commercial timber harvest. Increasingly, the conflict is shifting to the
   habitat needs of owls versus the need for active management of
   fire-adapted forest ecosystems to reduce the occurrence of
   uncharacteristic wildland fire that threatens multiple resource values.
   While some authors have called for active fuels management within the
   range of spotted owls, concerns remain over potential effects of less
   intensive, but more extensive, fuel reduction activities (i.e., thinning
   and prescribed burning). Reconciling fire and fuels management with owl
   conservation requires rigorous analysis of both the short- and
   long-terms risks of action versus no action. We use published literature
   and data from the southern Sierra Nevada to examine the potential
   effects of landscape-level reductions in canopy cover (CC) on owl
   occupancy and reproduction. Using a combination of population data,
   canopy cover measurements, and forest simulation models, we show that
   modest fuels treatments in the Sierra Nevada would not be expected to
   reduce canopy cover sufficiently to have measurable effects on owl
   reproduction. Sixty-year simulations predict that mechanical thinning or
   mechanical thinning plus fuel-break construction treatments in
   combination with either no fire or mixed-lethal fire scenarios will not
   degrade canopy conditions in productive owl territories, nor impede
   improvement of non-productive territories. In contrast, lethal fire
   simulations produced a pronounced and lasting negative effect. Our
   analysis supports the hypothesis that habitat needs for owl reproduction
   can be incorporated in developing effective fire and fuels management
   strategies that lessen the chances of uncharacteristic wildfire.
   Projections of future population trends are tempered by the knowledge
   that non-habitat factors such as variations in weather profoundly affect
   population dynamics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{With a total area of 160,000 km(2), the Pantanal is one of the largest
   wetlands in South America and certainly the most famous. It is essential
   for the maintenance of biodiversity and is highly ranked in national and
   international protection plans. The ecology of the Pantanal is
   influenced by the annual inundation, frequent fires during the dry
   period, and multiple human activities. To maintain traditional low
   density cattle ranching, which is the economic basis for the Pantanal's
   human population, the spread of woody vegetation into former pasture
   areas requires pasture clearing. Legal restrictions, however, have led
   to the confusion of pasture clearing with the illegal deforestation that
   has accompanied Brazil's rapid economic development, thus creating
   serious conflicts between the Pantanal's ranchers and the governmental
   environmental agency. This dichotomy of interests, i.e., the need to
   maintain habitat and species diversity while guaranteeing the
   livelihoods of the ranchers but warding off deforestation, can only be
   resolved through modern management plans that reconcile the requirements
   of environmental protection with the economic needs of the ranchers, who
   are the owners of most of the Pantanal. The key to any such plan's
   successful implementation is to consider the Pantanal not as a pristine
   wetland, but as a valuable cultural landscape. Over the last two and a
   half centuries, the vegetation in large parts of the Pantanal has been
   altered due to the presence of cattle ranches. This has maintained its
   habitat diversity and multiple services to humans and to the
   environment, including the enhancement of species diversity. This
   management practice corresponds to modern approaches in other parts of
   the world, where low density animal grazing, sometimes in combination
   with mechanical removal of woody vegetation are considered powerful
   management tools for the maintenance of valuable cultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Four species of saitcedars, Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb., Tamarix

   their hybrids, are exotic, invasive small trees from Asia that cause
   great damage to riparian ecosystems of the western United States. They
   displace native plant communities, degrade wildlife habitat (including
   that of many endangered species), increase soil salinity and wildfires,
   lower water tables, reduce water available for agriculture and
   municipalities, and reduce recreational use of affected areas.
   Phytophagous insects are abundant on saltcedar in the Old World and we
   selected Diorhabda elongata Brulle deserticola Chen as the top candidate
   biological control agent because of the great damage it causes, and its
   high host specificity, broad geographic range, and presumed adaptability
   in the United States. Literature review and our overseas surveys
   indicated that this insect is associated only with species of Tamarix
   and occasionally with Myricaria but not with Reumaria or Frankenia (all
   Tamaricales) in the Old World. In quarantine facilities in the United
   States, and overseas, we tested beetles from China and Kazakhstan on six
   species and three hybrids (26 accessions) of Tamarix and on 58 species
   of other plants, in 15 tests of different types, using 1852 adults and
   3547 larvae, over 10 years. Survival from larvae to adults averaged
   55-67\% on the Tamarit species, 12\% on Myricaria sp., and only 1.6\% on
   the three Frankenia spp. No larvae completed their development on any of
   the other 54 plant species tested, where most larvae died during the
   first instar. Adults oviposited readily on T ramosissima accessions,
   less on Tamarix aphylla (L.) Karst. (athel), and only rarely on other
   plants. The host range of the D. e. deserticola we tested from
   Kazakhstan was not different from those we tested from China. Therefore,
   D. e. deserticola, is sufficiently host-specific and was approved for
   field release in North America. This is the first biological control
   agent introduced into the United States for control of saltcedar.

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{463}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Deciduous shrubs are widely distributed throughout temperate and boreal
   conifer forests and influence a wide range of ecological processes and
   forest resources. In the interior western U.S., many deciduous shrubs
   are highly preferred forage by wild (elk, Germs canadensis; deer,
   Odocoileus spp.) and domestic (cattle) ungulates which can influence
   shrub abundance, composition, structural characteristics, and related
   ecological processes and interactions. Stand disturbances and
   silvicultural practices can also affect shrub assemblages and managers
   in the interior western U.S. are increasingly implementing fuels
   reduction treatments such as stand thinning and prescribed fire to
   reduce fuel loads caused by more than a century of fire suppression. We
   evaluated the effects of ungulate herbivory and fuels reduction, alone
   and in concert, on deciduous shrub assemblages in coniferous dry forests
   of the interior west. We measured shrub richness, diversity, height,
   abundance and community composition in forest stands that underwent
   fuels reduction 15-17 years earlier, compared to untreated stands where
   no silvicultural treatments have occurred in over 50 years. Within each
   stand type, we also measured shrub assemblages in stands with and
   without ungulate herbivory. Shrub richness, diversity, frequency and
   height all declined in stands subjected to either fuels reduction
   treatments or herbivory; effects were most pronounced under the combined
   effect of fuels reduction and herbivory. Fuels reduction and herbivory
   also resulted in significant differences in shrub abundance and
   assemblage composition. Fuels reduction in dry forests with abundant
   ungulates may contribute to suppressed, more homogenous shrub
   communities. These effects may result in unintended impacts or
   alterations to important ecosystem processes and forest resources. Our
   results highlight the importance of considering responses of forest
   resources with low economic value, such as shrubs, in forest management

Abstract = {{Measuring the effects of ecological restoration on wildlife assemblages
   requires study on broad temporal and spatial scales. Longleaf pine
   (Pinus palustris) forests are imperiled due to fire suppression and
   subsequent invasion by hardwood trees. We employed a landscape-scale,
   randomized-block design to identify how reptile assemblages initially
   responded to restoration treatments including removal of hardwood trees
   via mechanical methods (felling and girdling), application of
   herbicides, or prescribed burning alone. Then, we examined reptile
   assemblages after all sites experienced more than a decade of prescribed
   burning at two-to thee-year return intervals. Data were collected
   concurrently at reference sites chosen to represent target conditions
   for restoration. Reptile assemblages changed most rapidly in response to
   prescribed burning, but reptile assemblages at all sites, including
   reference sites, were generally indistinguishable by the end of the
   study. Thus, we suggest that prescribed burning in longleaf pine forests
   over long time periods is an effective strategy for restoring reptile
   assemblages to the reference condition. Application of herbicides or

Abstract = {{Hudson's Bay Company records were used to estimate the 1786-1911 annual
   number of moose (Alces alces andersonil) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou) involved in trade by northern Ojibwa natives to the company
   post at Osnaburgh House (51-degrees-10'N 90-degrees-15'W) in northwest
   Ontario, Canada. The human population for the early 19th century, and
   the number and severity of human starvations from 1786 to 191 1 were
   estimated. The extent of forest fires in the region around Osnaburgh was
   documented using a `'fire-day'' index computed from Hudson's Bay Company
   journals and using qualitative archival information. It is argued that
   the human population was too small to have caused the observed early
   19th century moose and caribou population decline solely through
   predation. Likewise, severe early 19th century famines were caused by
   climatic factors rather than by declines in moose and caribou numbers.
   Habitat change caused by increased forest fires correlates with the
   observed decline of caribou, while moose increased and subsequently
   collapsed as winter shelter was destroyed. A burgeoning human
   population, sustained during winter food shortages on potatoes donated
   by the Hudson's Bay Company, then kept ungulate populations to low
   levels until the late 19th century. Only then did maturing forests and a
   new outbreak of fires provide renewed habitat for resurgences of,
   respectively, caribou and moose.}},

Abstract = {{We analyse commercially operated rangelands as coupled systems of people
   and nature. The biophysical components include: (i) the reduction and
   recovery of potential primary production, reflected as changes in grass
   production per unit of rainfall, (ii) changes in woody plants dependent
   on the grazing and fire regimes; and (iii) livestock and wool dynamics
   influenced by season, condition of the rangeland and numbers of wild and
   feral animals. The social components include the managers, who vary with
   regard to a range of cognitive abilities and lifestyle choices, and the
   regulators who vary in regard to policy goals.
   We compare agent-based and optimization models of a rangeland system.
   The agent-based model leads to recognition that policies select for
   certain management practices by creating a template that governs the
   trajectories of the behaviour of individuals, learning, and overall
   system dynamics. Conservative regulations reduce short-term loss in
   production but also restrict learning. A free-market environment leads
   to severe degradation but the surviving pastoralists perform well under
   subsequent variable conditions. The challenge for policy makers is to
   balance the needs for learning and for preventing excessive degradation.
   A genetic algorithm model optimizing for net discounted income and based
   on a population of management solutions (stocking rate, how much to
   suppress fire, etc.) indicates that robust solutions lead to a loss of
   about 40\% compared with solutions where the sequence of rainfall was
   known in advance: this is a similar figure to that obtained from the
   agent-based model.
   We conclude that, on the basis of Levin's three criteria, rangelands
   with their livestock and human managers do constitute complex adaptive
   systems. If this is so, then command-and-control approaches to rangeland
   policy and management are bound to fail.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbances, wildfires, and weedy-plant invasions have
   destroyed and fragmented many sagebrush (Artemisia L. spp.) habitats.
   Sagebrush-dependent species like greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus) are vulnerable to these changes, making habitat monitoring
   essential to effective management. Conventional ground inventory methods
   are time consuming (expensive) and have lower data collection potentials
   than remote sensing. Our study evaluated the feasibility of ground
   (0.3-mm ground surface distance {[}GSD]) and aerial imagery (primarily,
   1-mm GSD) to assess ground cover for big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata
   Nutt.) and other vegetation functional groups important in sage-grouse
   breeding habitat (lekking, nesting, and brood rearing). We surveyed
   similar to 526 km(2) of the upper Powder River watershed in Natrona
   County, Wyoming, USA, a region dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young)
   communities interspersed with narrow riparian corridors. Our study area
   was used year-round by sage-grouse and included 16 leks. In June 2010,
   we acquired aerial images (1-mm resolution) for 3228 systematic sampling
   locations; additional images were acquired as rapid-succession bursts
   where aerial transects crossed riparian areas and for 39 riparian and 39
   upland ground locations (0.3-mm resolution) within 3.2-km of leks. We
   used SamplePoint software to quantify cover for plant taxa and
   functional groups using all ground images and a systematic sampling of
   aerial images. Canopy cover of sage-grouse food forbs-as averaged across
   aerial and ground imagery around all leks-was 1.8\% and 7.8\% in
   riparian and 0.5\% and 4.0\% in upland areas, respectively. Big
   sagebrush cover was 8.7\% from upland aerial images and 9.4\% from
   upland ground images. Aerial and ground imagery provided similar values
   for bare ground and shrubs in riparian and upland areas, whereas ground
   imagery provided finer-scale herbaceous-cover data that complemented the

   practical basis for landscape-scale management and are a cost-effective

Abstract = {{Healthy ecosystems include many species (high richness) with similar
   abundances (high evenness). Thus, both aspects of biodiversity are
   worthy of conservation. Simultaneously conserving richness and evenness
   might be difficult, however, if, for example, the restoration of
   previously absent species to low densities brings a cost in reduced
   evenness. Using meta-analysis, we searched for benefits to biodiversity
   following adoption of two common land-management schemes: the
   implementation of organic practices by farmers and of controlled burning
   by natural-land managers. We used rarefaction to eliminate sampling bias
   in all of our estimates of richness and evenness. Both conservation
   practices significantly increased evenness and overall abundance across
   taxonomic classifications (arthropods, birds, non-bird vertebrates,
   plants, soil organisms). Evenness and richness varied independently,
   leading to no richness-evenness correlation and no significant overall
   change in richness. Demonstrating the importance of rarefaction,
   analyses of raw data that did not receive rarefaction indicated
   misleadingly strong benefits of organic agriculture and burning for
   richness while underestimating true gains in evenness. Both organic
   farming and burning favored species that were not numerically dominant,
   re-balancing communities as uncommon species gained individuals. Our
   results support the assertion that richness and evenness capture
   separate facets of biodiversity, each needing individual attention

Abstract = {{Fire is a major disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems,
   leading to landscape transformation in fire-prone areas. Species in
   mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like
   fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are
   unclear. We use bipartite insect-flower interaction networks across a
   recently burned landscape to explore how plant-pollinator interaction
   networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level,
   and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the
   effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to
   hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower-visiting insects
   during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of
   flower-visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of
   fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic
   Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and
   pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in
   interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity
   was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also
   tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the
   valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of
   specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction
   network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However,
   species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant
   difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower-rich fire
   refuges sustain plant-pollinator interactions, especially those
   involving specialized species, in fire-disturbed landscape. This may be
   an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that
   the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of
   ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.}},

Abstract = {{Fire-induced changes in canopy openness may affect sunlight penetration
   to the forest floor, and thus the operative temperatures available to
   terrestrial ectotherms. We examined thermal regimes for two types of
   ectotherms: diurnally active species that utilize sun-exposed patches to
   regulate their body temperatures, and nocturnally active species that
   depend upon solar radiation striking the rocks under which they shelter.
   We measured canopy openness, shrub height, radiation transmission and
   operative environmental temperatures in the open and inside reptile
   retreat-sites, at 24 study sites in eucalypt forests in two regions
   (Gosford and Yengo) in south-eastern Australia. All sites were last
   burnt in 20002001, but had experienced different fire frequencies (14
   fires over the previous 37years). In Gosford, higher fire frequencies
   reduced canopy openness and radiation transmission at ground and shrub
   level, and thus reduced environmental temperatures and the thermal
   quality of reptile habitats. Our modelling based on thermal preferenda
   of an endangered snake species (the broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus
   bungaroides) suggests that increased fire frequency at Gosford halved
   the amount of time an animal could spend within its preferred
   (set-point) range, regardless of whether it thermoregulated beneath
   rocks or basked out in the open. At Yengo, however, fire frequency did
   not affect the thermal quality of reptile habitats. Thus, the effects of
   fire frequency on forest structure and the thermal environment at ground
   level differed between adjacent areas, and relatively small changes in
   canopy openness translated into major effects on thermoregulatory
   opportunities for reptiles. Although fire is a useful management tool
   for creating open habitats, we need to understand more about the effects
   of fire frequency on vegetation structure and thermal environment before
   we can use fire to manage habitats for reptiles.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning has the potential to improve habitat for species that
   depend on pyric ecosystems or other early successional vegetation types.
   For species that occupy diverse plant communities over the extent of
   their range, response to disturbances such as fire might vary based on
   post-disturbance vegetation dynamics among plant communities. Although
   responses of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) to fire have been studied
   in conifer-dominated forests in northern parts of the species' range,
   there is a lack of information on snowshoe hare habitat use in
   fire-dependent communities in southern parts of their range. We used
   global positioning system (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF)
   radio-collars to monitor the habitat use of 32 snowshoe hares in a
   scrub-oak (Quercus ilicifolia)-pitch pine (Pinus rigida) barrens complex
   in northeastern Pennsylvania where prescribed fire has been used for
   habitat restoration. The area contained stands that underwent prescribed
   burning 1-6 years prior to our study. Also, we investigated fine-scale
   determinants of habitat use within stands. We found that regardless of
   season, hares did not select for areas that had been burned within 6
   years prior. Hares primarily used stands of older scrub oak, conifer, or
   hardwoods, which contained dense understory vegetation and canopy cover.
   Hare habitat use also was positively associated with stand edges. Our
   results suggest that hares do not respond to prescribed burning of scrub
   oak in the short-term. In addition, by focusing on structural
   determinants of habitat use, rather than broad-scale characteristics
   such as stand type, management strategies for snowshoe hares can be
   adapted over the extent of their range despite the multitude of
   different land cover types across which the species occurs. (c) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Land management agencies in northwest Wyoming have implemented an active

   clones are susceptible to extensive browsing from elk concentrated on
   supplemental feedgrounds and from wintering moose. Previous attempts at
   fire-induced aspen regeneration in the area indicate various levels of
   success due to existing herbivory levels. Belt transects were
   established in fire-treated aspen clones along the Gros Ventre drainage,
   northeast of Jackson, Wyoming. Sucker heights and densities were
   compared between northeast and south/southwest exposures to determine
   fire-induced regeneration success and opportunities for future
   successful treatments. Overall stem density has not changed (p <0.05)

   m in 1999. Due to differential snow accumulations affecting browse
   availability, northeast (NE) and south-southwest (SSW) aspects were
   compared. Mean stem densities are not different between these aspects (p
   <0.05). However, mean stem height on NE aspects (1.4 m) was greater (p
   <0.05) than SSW aspects (0.80 m). Our ability to detect a difference in
   regenerating aspen height between aspects was probably due to
   differential browsing levels of ungulates. Such information is important

Abstract = {{Questions: Are exotic plant species favoured by non-native ungulate
   herbivores and disadvantaged by native herbivores in forested
   rangelands? Do the impacts of ungulates on exotic vs native plants
   depend on forest management activities such as prescribed fire and stand
   thinning?
   Location: Northeastern Oregon, USA.
   Methods: We recorded changes in richness and cover of different exotic
   and native plant life forms in experimental plots that were grazed only
   by cattle (a non-native herbivore), only by elk (a native herbivore) or
   not grazed by any ungulate over a 7-yr period at both managed (recently
   burned and thinned) and unmanaged (where no fire and thinning has
   occurred in >40 yr) forest stands.
   Results: There was a general decrease in exotic plant species richness
   and cover across all treatments. However, the decrease in exotic
   richness, particularly of exotic annual forbs, was slightly lower in
   plots grazed by elk than in ungrazed plots at managed stands. Managed
   stands also displayed a larger increase in native annual forb richness
   and exotic graminoid richness, and a larger decrease in native perennial
   graminoid cover with cattle grazing than elk grazing. At unmanaged
   stands, cover of woody native plants such as shrubs, sub-shrubs and
   trees as well as native perennial forbs decreased or remained relatively
   constant with elk grazing while increasing strongly at plots that were
   ungrazed or grazed by cattle.
   Conclusions: Cattle and elk have variable effects on different plant
   guilds at managed vs unmanaged forest stands. Overall, cattle grazing
   tends to have a larger impact on herbaceous plant guilds at managed
   stands, while elk grazing tends to have a larger impact on woody plant
   guilds at unmanaged stands. However, in contrast to findings from other
   ecosystems, grazing only has a minor impact on exotic plant dynamics in
   our study area, and cattle grazing does not favour exotic plants any
   more than grazing by elk or ungulate exclusion.}},

   tolerance (traits that facilitate recovery from damage) and escape
   (traits that reduce exposure to herbivores). Here, we review the current
   state of knowledge about aspen defense against herbivores, with
   particular focus on montane habitats of western North America.
   The principal chemical defenses of aspen are phenylpropanoid-derived
   compounds, including phenolic glycosides (salicinoids) and condensed
   tannins. Phenolic glycosides reduce feeding, growth and survival of
   insect herbivores and deter feeding by mammalian herbivores. Expression
   of chemical defense traits is strongly influenced by genotype,
   development, environment (biotic and abiotic) and interactions among
   those factors, and high levels of defense exact a cost to growth. The
   value of tolerance as a defense strategy likely increases with tree age.
   Both tolerance and escape via vertical growth are also highly
   genetically variable in aspen.
   The efficacy of aspen defense systems is context-dependent. Under
   conditions of low to moderate herbivore pressure, chemical defenses
   serve as effective deterrents, and well-defended genotypes are
   selectively favored. Under conditions of high herbivore pressure -
   whether insect or mammal - resistance fails and trees sustain high
   levels of damage. Under these conditions, genotypes with high levels of
   tolerance are likely selectively favored.
   Large-scale landscape modifiers, coupled with genetic, developmental and
   local environmental variation, produce temporal and spatial mosaics of
   defense across western landscapes. Competition with conifers, fire
   severity, and extreme climatic events all influence expression of
   defense and response to herbivore damage in aspen.
   Aspen's extraordinary genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity are no
   match for the environmental stressors, particularly ungulate browsing,
   contributing to its decline in portions of the Interior West. Management
   approaches should capitalize on the genetic and environmental factors
   known to contribute to diverse expression of defense in aspen, while
   maintaining herbivore population densities below levels that overwhelm
   all combinations of defense traits. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of prescription fire has long been recognized as a reliable
   management tool to suppress vegetative succession processes and to
   reduce fuel loading to prevent catastrophic wildfires, but very little
   attention has been paid to the effects on aquatic systems. A late-fall
   prescribed burn was implemented to characterize effects on an aquatic
   community within a montane grassland system in north-central New Mexico.
   The fire treatment was consistent with protocols of a managed burn
   except that the fire was allowed to burn through the riparian area to
   the treatment stream to replicate natural fire behavior. In addition to
   summer and fall preburn assessment of the treatment and reference
   stream, we characterized immediate postfire effects (within a week for
   macroinvertebrates and within 6 months for fish) and seasonal effects
   over a 2-year period. Responses within the treatment stream were
   compared with an unburned reference stream adjacent to the prescription
   burn. During the burn, the diel range in air temperature increased by 5
   degrees C while diel range in water temperature did not change.
   Carbon-nitrogen ratios did not differ between treatment and reference
   streams, indicating the contribution of ash from the surrounding
   grassland was negligible. Although total taxa and species richness of
   aquatic macroinvertebrates were not altered, qualitative indices
   revealed departure from preburn condition due to loss of sensitive taxa
   (mayflies {[}order Ephemeroptera] and stoneflies {[}order Plecoptera])
   and an increase in tolerant taxa (midges {[}order Chironomidae])
   following the burn. Within 1 year of the burn, these attributes returned
   to preburn conditions. The density and recruitment of adult Brown Trout
   Salmo trutta did not differ between pre- and postburn collections, nor
   did fish condition differ. Fire is rarely truly replicated within a
   given study. Although our study represents one replication, the results
   will inform managers about the importance in timing (seasonality) of
   prescription burn and anticipated effects on aquatic communities.

Abstract = {{Increasing agricultural activities have been shown to affect soil and
   vegetation changes leading to serious biodiversity declines throughout
   the world. These effects are amplified in dry grassland areas, where
   resulting changes in habitat structure affect threatened animals on long
   temporal scales. Great bustards (Otis tarda) inhabit open landscapes
   where fire and grazing have been a part of the natural disturbance
   regime since historical times. Even fire and grazing are hypothesized to
   be important factors in the lifecycle of the species, studies are still
   missing on disturbance-related lekking distribution patterns of great
   bustards. We analyzed the importance of fires and grazing on the spatial
   distribution of lekking bustards controlling for habitat types, habitat
   diversity, distance from roads and social effects. Our standardized
   dataset spanned 31 years, being one of the largest datasets on bustard
   lekking. During the 31 years we observed 10 118 individuals at 639
   observation points in Hortobagy National Park, East-Hungary. One of the
   most important predictors for total number of birds and number of males
   was the area burnt in previous years. We found that increased habitat
   diversity had a positive effect on female numbers. Models fit on
   second-and third-year burn data detected no substantial role of burning
   on lekking distribution. Our results suggest that introduction of a
   patch-burning management system in lekking areas could increase the
   availability of optimal lek sites for bustards. As an effective
   management tool, we suggest applying patch-burning annually in a
   spatially mosaic structure inside the area occupied by each
   sub-population unit. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The fire-adapted vegetation in east-central Florida provides habitat for
   many threatened and endangered species, such as the Florida scrub-jay
   (Aphelocoma coerulescens). Accurate fire occurrence records are
   critically important for better understanding the relationship between
   fire and vegetation structure. The rapid growth rates of fire-adapted
   vegetation in east-central Florida make it difficult to capture detailed
   fire scars with remote sensing data acquired weeks after the fires. The
   objective of this study is to develop a reliable remote sensing approach
   for accurately mapping burned areas in Florida scrub vegetation at the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) John F. Kennedy
   Space Center (KSC) and Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge (MINWR).
   Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data acquired on 21 April 1987 were used
   for classification experiments. Geographic information system (GIS) data
   layers of fire management units (FMUs) with known fire occurrence
   (presence or absence) were used to mask the original remote sensing data
   or thematic maps following classification. A separation index (SI) was
   used to evaluate each individual band for its power to discriminate
   unburned and burned areas. Twelve classifications with selected band
   groups derived from Landsat TM data with different geographic extents
   were compared using an error matrix method. The classification of the
   four most suitable bands derived for the entire KSC-MINWR area resulted
   in the highest accuracy. The final map product was generated by
   overlaying the classified map with the FMU data layer and masking out
   FMUs that did not burn. This paper addresses a number of issues relevant
   to the classification of burned areas and includes the effect of
   geographic extent (GE effect) of remote sensing data on classification,
   determining the best bands for classification, and cleaning
   classification results using GIS masking. It also serves as the first
   published effort to map fire scars in the Florida scrub and flatwoods
   vegetative communities of the southeastern US using image processing
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Given that land-use change is the main cause of global biodiversity
   decline, there is widespread interest in adopting land-use practices
   that maintain high levels of biodiversity, and in restoring degraded
   land that previously had high biodiversity value. In this study, we use
   ant taxonomic and functional diversity to examine the effects of
   different land uses (agriculture, pastoralism, silviculture and
   conservation) and restoration practices on Cerrado (Brazilian savanna)
   biodiversity. We also examine the extent to which ant diversity and
   composition can be explained by vegetation attributes that apply across
   the full land management spectrum. We surveyed vegetation attributes and
   ant communities in five replicate plots of each of 13 land-use and
   restoration treatments, including two types of native vegetation as
   reference sites: cerrado sensu stricto and cerradAo. Several land-use
   and restoration treatments had comparable plot richness to that of the
   native reference habitats. Ant species and functional composition varied
   systematically among land-use treatments following a gradient from open
   habitats such as agricultural fields to forested sites. Tree basal area
   and grass cover were the strongest predictors of ant species richness.
   Losses in ant diversity were higher in land-use systems that transform
   vegetation structure. Among productive systems, therefore, uncleared
   pastures and old pine plantations had similar species composition to
   that occurring in cerrado sensu stricto. Restoration techniques
   currently applied to sites that were previously Cerrado have focused on
   returning tree cover, and have failed to restore ant communities typical
   of savanna. To improve restoration outcomes for Cerrado biodiversity,
   greater attention needs to be paid to the re-establishment and
   maintenance of the grass layer, which requires frequent fire. At the
   broader scale, conservation planning in agricultural landscapes, should
   recognize the value of land-use mosaics and the risks of homogenization.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the
   central nervous system (CNS) that involves the autoreactive T-cell
   attack on axonal myelin sheath. Lesions or plaques formed as a result of
   repeated damage and repair mechanisms lead to impaired relay of
   electrical impulses along the nerve, manifesting as clinical symptoms of
   MS. Evidence from studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
   (EAE) models of MS strongly suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction
   presents at the onset of disease and throughout the disease course. The
   aim of this study was to determine if mitochondrial dysfunction occurs
   before clinical symptoms arise, and whether this is confined to the CNS.
   EAE was induced in C57B/L6 mice, and citrate synthase and mitochondrial
   respiratory chain (MRC) complex I-IV activities were assayed at
   presymptomatic (3 or 10 days post first immunisation (3 or 10 DPI)) and
   asymptomatic (17 days post first immunisation (17 DPI) time-points in
   central nervous system (CNS; spinal cord) and peripheral (liver and jaw
   muscle) tissues. Samples from animals immunised with myelin
   oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) as EAE models were compared with
   control animals immunised with adjuvant (ADJ) only. Significant changes
   in MOG compared to control ADJ animals in MRC complex I activity
   occurred only at presymptomatic stages, with an increase in the spinal
   cord at 10 DPI (87.9\%), an increase at 3 DPI (25.6\%) and decrease at
   10 DPI (22.3\%) in the jaw muscle, and an increase in the liver at 10
   DPI (71.5\%). MRC complex II/III activity changes occurred at
   presymptomatic and the asymptomatic stages of the disease, with a
   decrease occurring in the spinal cord at 3 DPI (87.6\%) and an increase
   at 17 DPI (36.7\%), increase in the jaw muscle at 10 DPI (25.4\%), and
   an increase at 3 DPI (75.2\%) and decrease at 17 DPI (95.7\%) in the
   liver. Citrate synthase activity was also significantly decreased at 10
   DPI (27.3\%) in the liver. No significant changes were observed in
   complex IV across all three tissues assayed. Our findings reveal
   evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is present at the asymptomatic
   stages in the EAE model of MS, and that the changes in MRC enzyme
   activities are tissue-specific and are not confined to the CNS.}},

Abstract = {{Following Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s, fire suppression
   and livestock grazing in ponderosa pine-bunchgrass ecosystems of the
   southwestern US resulted in the replacement of grass openings with dense
   stands of ponderosa pine. This, in turn, has led to apparent decreases
   in decomposition, net N mineralization, and soil respiration (i.e., net
   Soil CO2 efflux) rates, losses of floral and faunal diversity, and
   greater risk of the occurrence of stand-replacing wildfire. Alterations
   in ecosystem structure and function have prompted the implementation of
   restoration treatments throughout the region. Using a retrospective
   approach, we investigated the effects of thinning, thinning plus
   prescribed fire, and wildfire, 6-15 years following treatments, on
   ecosystem processes and properties across a 750-km(2) area in northern
   Arizona. We found that stands that had thinning or thinning plus burning
   treatments had lower in situ annual rates of net N mineralization in the
   mineral soil than unmanaged stands. However, stands burned by
   high-severity wildfire had net N mineralization rates that were about
   60\% higher than unmanaged stands. Because of similarities in net N
   mineralization rates among treatments under laboratory conditions, we
   speculate that variation in in situ net N transformation rates among
   stands were due to differences in C inputs (thinned and thinned plus
   burned) and soil microclimate (wildfire) among the stands. Size of the
   soil microbial C and N pools generally declined with decreases in
   litterfall (highest in unmanaged, intermediate in thinned and thinned
   plus burned, and lowest in wildfire stands); however, in situ rates of
   net soil CO2 efflux did not follow this pattern. Our results contrast
   with some previous studies in southwestern ponderosa pine forests where
   restoration treatments (both thinning and thinning plus burning)
   increased net N transformation rates. We hypothesize that the
   dissimilarity in responses to treatments across studies is due to
   differences in the relative effect of these treatments on the quantity
   and quality of C inputs. Large increases in easily decomposable
   understory biomass following restoration treatments appear to result in
   increases in N cycling rates, whereas treatments that result in either
   no change or minimal increases in understory biomass, accompanied by a
   long-term decrease in pine needle input to the forest floor, lead to
   reductions in N cycling rates. We recommend that restoration and
   fire-hazard reduction treatments be applied preferentially to stands
   that currently have low understory production. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Author summary The results demonstrate the ecological potential
   ofTriatoma brasiliensisin the northeastern caatinga and how this species
   uses the resources available in nature or in the modified environment by
   man. Triatomines were collected in peridomestic, sylvatic, and
   intradomicile habitats. House infestations were evaluated on five
   occasions, with spraying of infested houses.T.brasiliensiswas
   responsible for the high rates of dispersal, infestation, colonization
   andTrypanosoma cruziinfection in all catches and environments studied
   here. Spraying strongly reduced the infestation, but the number of
   triatomines rapidly returned to previous levels. Peridomicile represents
   a complex set of overlapping infested sites forming a network of
   shelters that favor the establishment and proliferation of triatomine
   colonies. Molecular characterization ofT.cruziisolated from triatomines
   and identification of their food sources emphasize the overlap of
   habitats and interaction among triatomines, synanthropic reservoirs and
   humans, increasing the risk of parasite transmission. Therefore, it is
   clear the need for maintenance of vector control fully and
   systematically with the use of appropriate strategies where
   interventions should consider regional ecoepidemiologic differences and
   the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors
   inT.cruzytransmission process into domicile environment.
   The northeastern semiarid region stands out in the Brazilian context
   regarding the eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease, in whichTriatoma
   brasiliensisis the main vector ofTrypanosoma cruzi. Persistent house
   invasion threatens the relative levels of progress achieved over
   previous decades. We conducted an intervention trial with a five-year
   follow-up to assess the impacts of residual spraying with pyrethroid
   insecticides on house infestation withT.brasiliensisin 18 rural villages
   (242 houses) located in the Taua, Ceara. House infestations were
   assessed by systematic manual searches for triatomines in every domestic
   and peridomestic habitat on five occasions. Triatomines were collected
   in peridomestic (57.5\%), sylvatic (35.8\%), and intradomiciliary
   (6.7\%) habitats. The most important ecotopes ofT.brasiliensiswere
   containing roofing tiles, bricks or rocks (23.4\% +/- 9.1). Residual
   insecticide spraying substantially reduced baseline house infestation
   rates from 27.9\% to 5.9\% by 6 months post first spraying (MPS). The
   decline was substantially greater in intradomiciles (11.2\% to 0.8\%)
   than in peridomiciles (16.7\% to 5\%). The mean relative density of
   triatomines recovered its preintervention values at 14 MPS in
   intradomiciles, and in the main peridomestic ecotopes. The house
   infestation levels recorded at 14 MPS persisted thereafter despite all
   reinfested houses were selectively sprayed on every occasion. Overall
   average bug infection rates withT.cruziin the five occasions were in
   intradomiciles (11.1\%), peridomiciles (4.7\%) and wild habitats
   (3.3\%). In peridomicileT.cruziinfection rates decreased significantly
   at all stages after chemical intervention. In intradomicile, the only
   significant difference occurred at 20 MPS (7.7\% to 30.8\%). The
   vectorial capacity ofT.brasiliensis, combined with its invasive
   potential from sylvatic sources and the limited effectiveness of
   chemical control in the harshcaatingalandscape, pose serious obstacles
   to the definite elimination of domestic transmission risks. Systematic
   vector surveillance supported by community participation and locally
   adapted environmental management measures are needed to reduce the risks
   of establishment of domestic transmission withT.cruziin this region.}},

   Resulting plant communities were described in fall 1998. Spring imazapic
   and glyphosate applications reduced (P < 0.05) tall fescue cover
   compared to the untreated controls. Among the spring treatments,
   imazapic applications resulted in greater (P < 0.05) coverage of NWSG
   than glyphosate applications. The best treatment to kill tall fescue and

Abstract = {{The two forest-management practices of prescribed burning and thinning
   are techniques used to reduce heavy fuel loads that have resulted from
   years of fire suppression. Therefore, the National Fire and Fire
   Surrogate (NFFS) study was conducted to determine the effects of
   prescribed burning and thinning on different environmental factors. This
   study was conducted in the Clemson University Experimental Forest in
   South Carolina, one of the 13 NFFS sites in the United States, and
   examined the impacts of these management practices on spider
   populations. We used pitfall traps to sample ground-dwelling spiders to
   determine if changes in population levels had occurred one year
   following implementation of these practices. We collected a total of
   1220 specimens of Araneae. representing 13 families. Results indicated
   that by 1-year post-treatment, spider populations had recovered
   following the initial (2001) burning and thinning However, in 2002, when
   we compared the first post-burn samples to pre-burn samples in thin+burn
   plots, we found a significant decrease in the mean abundance of
   Agelenidae and Linyphiidae after the prescribed burn.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Do successional trajectories in plant diversity,
   heterogeneity and dominance respond differently to ungulate exclusion in
   unmanaged forests vs managed forests that are thinned and burned? Is
   vegetation in recently thinned and burned stands more sensitive to
   changes in the grazing regime?
   Location: Northeast OR, USA.
   Methods: We evaluated changes in plant community composition, diversity,
   heterogeneity and dominance under herbivory by multiple ungulates
   (cattle, elk, deer) vs ungulate exclusion at sites where trees were
   recently thinned and a prescribed burn was applied (managed), and in
   sites that were not thinned or burned in over 40 yr (unmanaged). Plant
   species diversity was calculated with the Simpsons index and richness as
   the total number of plant species. We estimated changes in plant
   community heterogeneity using a measure of taxonomic dissimilarity.
   Plant dominance was measured as the relative evenness among different
   plant functional groups (annual and perennial forbs and graminoids, and
   shrubs, subshrubs and trees).
   Results: As expected, managed sites displayed more early succession
   species, such as annual forbs and annual graminoids, while unmanaged
   sites were dominated by late-succession species such as shrubs,
   subshrubs and trees. Species richness, particularly of annuals, was
   strongly reduced when ungulates were excluded from managed sites, and to
   a lesser extent from unmanaged sites for some perennial plant species.
   Species diversity decreased to a slightly greater extent with ungulate
   exclusion at managed sites. Species dominance was not influenced by
   ungulate exclusion. The effect of ungulate exclusion on plant
   heterogeneity also depended on forest management. Heterogeneity
   increased at managed sites and decreased in unmanaged sites with
   ungulate exclusion. Overall, the change in vegetation composition over
   time increased with the exclusion of ungulates, particularly at managed
   sites.
   Conclusions: The strength and direction of specific vegetation and
   diversity responses to ungulate exclusion vary with forest management,
   and the influence of ungulate exclusion on plant succession is more
   pronounced in recently thinned and burned sites. Management of wild and
   domestic ungulates thus needs to account for forest management
   activities that alter vegetation seral stage and increase the
   sensitivity of vegetation to the ungulate grazing regime.}},

   crypto-biotic crust (P < 0.0001). Seed predation rates increased under
   more prescribed burns over the last 10 y (P = 0.034) and 19 years (P =

   species). Species composition also changed: 27 species were exclusive to
   the control area, 13 species occurred only in the burnt area, while only
   four species were sampled in both areas. Species reduction in the burnt
   area may be considered a symptom of the environmental change caused by
   the destruction of vegetation and litter by fire. Some ant species, such
   as Pachycondyla stigma, Ectatomma muticum, Ectatomma permagnum and Atta
   robusta were severely affected by the fire, disappearing in the burnt

Abstract = {{Sandplain and ridgetop pitch pine (Pinus rigida)-scrub oak (Quercus
   ilicifolia) barrens and other shrub-dominated natural communities (e.g.,
   heathlands and maritime shrublands) are important habitats for rare
   Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) in southern New England and
   southeastern New York. Fifty-six species of conservation concern
   representing I I families of Lepidoptera are recognized as dependent on
   shrubland habitats in this region, including 23\% of Connecticut's
   state-listed Lepidoptera and 41\% of state-listed moths and butterflies
   in Massachusetts. Sixteen (29\%) of these 56 species utilize scrub oak
   as a larval host and eight species (14\%) use lowbush blueberries
   (Vaccinium angustifolium and V pallidum). In addition to Lepidoptera, a
   wide diversity of other invertebrates is dependent on pine barrens and
   other shrublands. The importance of these habitats results from unique
   edaphic conditions and temperature regimes, as well as the structure,
   species composition, and phenology of the plant community. Pine barrens
   and other shrublands in the northeastern United States are threatened by
   destruction and fragmentation, as well as fire exclusion and other
   alterations of natural disturbance regimes. Active management, including
   the application of prescribed fire, mechanical cutting, or a combination
   of the two, is critical to the maintenance of habitat structure and
   species composition in barrens and other shrublands within
   human-dominated landscapes of the northeastern United States. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Moorland habitats dominated by the dwarf shrub Calluna vulgaris provide
   important ecosystem services. Drought is projected to intensify
   throughout their range, potentially leading to increased fire severity
   as moisture is a key control on severity. We studied the effect of low
   fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire severity by using 2 x 2 mrain-out
   shelters prior to completing 19 experimental fires in two sites in
   Scotland (UK): a dry heath with thin organic soils and a raised bog with
   deep, saturated peat, both dominated by Calluna vulgaris. Reduced FMC of
   the moss and litter (M/L) layer at both sites, and the soil moisture of
   the dry heath, increased fire-induced consumption of the M/L layer and
   soil heating at both sites. Increase in fire severity was greater at the
   dry heath than at the raised bog, e.g. average maximum temperatures at
   the soil surface increased from 31 degrees C to 189 degrees C at the dry
   heath, but only from 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C at the raised bog.
   Substantial M/L layer consumption was observed when its FMC was below
   150\%. This led to larger seasonal and daily soil temperature
   fluctuation, particularly at the dry heath during warm months. The
   results suggest that low FMC following predicted changes in climate are
   likely to increase wildfire severity and that the impact on vegetation
   composition and carbon stores may be greater at heathlands than at
   peatlands. Managed burning aiming to minimise fire severity (e.g.
   ignition of the M/L layer and exposure to lethal temperatures of ericoid
   seeds) should be carried out when the FMC of the M/L layer is above
   150\% and the FMC of the soil is above 200-300\%. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the main components of
   current anthropogenic global change. Unravelling the ecological response
   of biodiversity to the combined effect of land use change and other
   stressors is essential for effective conservation. For this purpose, we
   used co-inertia analysis to combine LULCC analysis of earth observation
   satellite data-derived maps and raptor data obtained from road censuses
   conducted in 2001 and 2014 at sampling unit level (10 km(2) spatial
   resolution), in northwestern Spain (province of Ourense, c. 7281 km(2)).
   In addition, habitat suitability models were also computed using ten
   widely used single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of
   predictions at landscape level (four spatial resolutions: 500-m, 1-km,
   2-km and 5-km radius around each sighting) for each year and raptor
   species to analyse the habitat suitability changes in the whole study
   area through three niche overlap indices. The models revealed an
   increase in occurrence and habitat suitability of forest raptor species
   coupled with a strong decrease in species associated with open habitats,
   mainly heaths and shrub formations. Open-habitat specialist species were
   negatively affected by the concomitant effects of intensive forest
   management and a long-lasting trend of rural abandonment coupled with an
   unusually high frequency of wildfires. Sustainable forest management and
   agricultural practices should be encouraged by both public and private
   sectors, through, e.g. policies related to European funds for rural and
   regional development (FEDER and FEADER programs) to effectively protect
   threatened habitats and species, and to comply with current
   environmental legislation. The combined use of satellite imagery and
   ground-level biodiversity data proved to be a cost-effective and

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{436-445}},
Abstract = {{Context. Fire and grazing have complex and interacting impacts on food
   resources available to endangered herbivores and can potentially be
   manipulated as part of conservation strategies.
   Aims. We examined the interacting impacts of fire and grazing on the
   food resources available to a colony of endangered brush-tailed
   rock-wallabies (Petrogale penicillata) to test fire as a potential
   management tool.
   Methods. We conducted two manipulative experiments using a
   repeated-measures split-block design. We measured the effects of grazing
   and strategic burning on total vegetation biomass and on particular
   plants selected by rock-wallabies. In the first experiment we measured
   the impact of rock-wallaby grazing alone. In the second experiment we
   measured grazing impacts by both rock-wallabies and potentially
   competitive sympatric macropods. Grazing was manipulated with three
   treatments: grazed (open), ungrazed (fenced) and procedural control
   (half fence).
   Key results. In both experiments, burning resulted in greater
   above-ground biomass of plants selected by rock-wallabies. The response
   of different plant functional groups to fire was staggered, with forb
   biomass peaking early and browse biomass increasing above unburnt levels
   a year after burning.
   Conclusions. Despite the limited grazing pressure exerted by the small
   colony of rock-wallabies in Experiment 1 we detected a negative grazing
   effect on forbs growing after fire in burnt plots. In Experiment 2,
   grazing pressure was much more marked due to the high densities of
   sympatric macropods. In this case, while burning resulted in greater
   biomass of plants selected by rock-wallabies, grazing (predominantly by
   sympatric macropods) negated this effect.
   Implications. Small patchwork burning can be a useful tool to improve
   food resources for brush-tailed rock-wallabies, with effects sustained
   over more than two years. However, when rock-wallabies are sympatric
   with possible competitor species, the grazing impacts of sympatric
   macropods may cancel out any benefits to rock-wallabies.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Background A fire management strategy of deliberate patch-mosaic burning
   (PMB) is postulated to promote biodiversity by providing a range of
   habitat patches with different fire histories, habitat qualities, and
   vegetation ages at a given scale. We investigated the response of avian
   fauna to fire, particularly species richness and community composition,
   in a landscape composed of a diversity of vegetation ages including
   long-unburned refuges (age 26 years), compared with a landscape of
   uniform vegetation ages recovering from an extensive and intense fire.
   Results There was no effect of heterogeneity in vegetation age on
   species richness at whole forest management block (about 6000 ha), or
   local (2 ha) scales. There were different responses of particular
   species to vegetation age. Nine species showed responses to vegetation
   age at local (2 ha) scales, which is presumably a surrogate for
   availability of key resources and which changes over time. Australian
   Pipit (Anthus australis Vieillot, 1818) were absent from swamp
   vegetation <3.5 years old, while Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus
   Shaw \& Nodder, 1792) were only found in forest vegetation Conclusions
   Mosaics of different vegetation ages had no net benefit for
   biodiversity, as measured by species richness and assemblage
   composition, at the forest block management unit scale. Different
   responses to vegetation age among bird species did not lead to increased
   bird richness at the scale of forest management block. A potential
   advantage of mosaics in conservation of avian biodiversity is through
   preservation of patches of older vegetation ages in the landscape,
   compared to the periodic extensive loss of older vegetation ages in
   wildfires. However, the absence of large-scale effects of vegetation age
   on bird species richness, the tendency for birds to specialize to fuel
   ages >5.5 years in the landscape studied, and indications of flexible
   responses of some species at landscape scales allows some flexibility in
   fuel management strategies and the scale at which they are applied with
   respect to avifauna.}},

Abstract = {{Recent and unprecedented scale of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus

   community-level benefits afforded to other sagebrush-obligate species.
   We use North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) count data and
   machine-learning to assess predictors influencing spatial distribution
   and abundance of three sagebrush-obligate songbirds (Brewer's sparrow
   {[}Spizella breweri], sagebrush sparrow {[}Artemisiospiza nevadensis],
   and sage thrasher {[}Oreoscoptes montanus]). We quantified co-occurrence
   of songbird abundance with sage-grouse lek distributions using point
   pattern analyses and evaluated the concurrence of songbird abundance
   within sage-grouse habitat restoration and landscape protection.
   Sagebrush land-cover predictors were positively associated with the
   abundance of each songbird species in models that explained 16-37\% of
   variation in BBS route level counts. Individual songbird models
   identified an apparent 40\% threshold in sagebrush land-cover, over
   which songbird abundances nearly doubled. Songbird abundances were
   positively associated with sage-grouse distributions (P < 0.01);
   range-wide, landscapes supporting > 50\% of males on leks also harbored
   13-19\% higher densities of songbirds compared with range-wide mean
   densities. Eighty-five percent of the conifer removal conducted through
   the Sage Grouse Initiative coincided with high to moderate Brewer's
   sparrow abundance. Wyoming's landscape protection (i.e., ``core
   area{''}) strategy for sagegrouse encompasses half the high to moderate
   abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations. In the Great
   Basin half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage
   thrasher populations coincide with sage-grouse Fire and Invasive

Abstract = {{Banksia woodlands are renowned for their flammability and prescribed
   fire is increasingly employed to reduce the risk of wildfire and to
   protect life and property, particularly where these woodlands occur on
   the urban interface. Prescribed fire is also employed as a tool for
   protecting biodiversity assets but can have adverse impacts on native
   plant communities. We investigated changes in species richness and cover
   in native and introduced flora following autumn prescribed fire in a
   700-hectare Banksia/Tuart (Eucalyptus gomphocephala) woodland that had
   not burnt for more than 30 years. Effectiveness of management techniques
   at reducing weed cover and the impacts of grazing by Western Grey
   Kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) postfire were also investigated. Thirty
   plots were established across a designated burn boundary immediately
   before a prescribed fire in May 2011, and species richness and cover
   were measured 3 years after the fire, in spring of 2013. Fencing
   treatments were established immediately following the fire, and weed
   management treatments were applied annually in winter over the
   subsequent 3 years. Our results indicate that autumn prescribed fire can
   facilitate increases in weed cover, but management techniques can limit
   the establishment of targeted weeds postfire. Postfire grazing was found
   to have significant adverse impacts on native species cover and
   vegetation structure, but it also limited establishment of some serious
   weeds including Pigface (Carpobrotus edulis). Manipulating herbivores in

   Willamette Valley of western Oregon. Areas containing L. bradshawii were
   treated with two or three fall season prescribed burns during a
   nine-year period. Foliar crown area, height, umbellets, and schizocarps
   of 150 L. bradshawii at Rose Prairie and 250 at Fisher Butte and the
   recruitment and density of L. bradshawii in 2-m(2) plots at both sites
   were documented during 1988-1996. When both sites were considered
   together, crown area, height, umbellets, and schizocarps per plant
   initially responded positively to burn treatments, but increases were
   not consistent across years or sites. Crown area tended to increase and
   then decline after each burn. Burning initially enhanced schizocarp
   production at both sites; schizocarps declined one or two years after
   burning but remained much higher in the burn treatments than in controls
   until 1996. Seedling production was not correlated with schizocarp
   production at either site. Umbellet and schizocarp production were not
   correlated with January-June temperatures or precipitation at the
   nearest weather station. Burning accentuated differences in size and
   reproductive capacity of L. bradshawii at the two sites and
   differentially affected recruitment and density. Random resampling of L.
   bradshawii in 1997 indicated that effects of repeated burning during the
   previous eight years were hard to detect. At Rose Prairie, foliar crown
   area, height, number of leaves, umbellets, and schizocarps in 1997 were
   similar or lower with burning than in unburned controls. At Fisher
   Butte, L. bradshawii in the two burn treatment were similar to control
   plants, but three burns significantly increased foliar crown area,
   number of leaves, and schizocarps. Monitoring recovery for one or two
   years after a burn may only capture the initial stimulation provided by
   burning and may foster unrealistically high expectations concerning the
   viability of an endangered plant population.}},

Abstract = {{Monsoon rainforest is a key habitat in sustaining the natural and
   cultural values for which Kakadu National Park is World Heritage listed.
   The integrity of monsoon rainforest boundaries was thought to have been
   threatened by an increase in fire and feral animal disturbance over the
   last few decades. However, as no broad-scale assessment of rainforest
   boundary change had been undertaken, the rate and even direction of
   boundary change remained uncertain. In this study changes to the
   boundaries of 50 monsoon rainforest patches were assessed using temporal
   sequences of digitised aerial photography, with a view to understanding
   the relative importance of the drivers of change. Boundaries were
   compared for each of the years 1964, 1984, 1991 and 2004. Vegetation
   types were manually classified for each year with a 20 x 20 In point
   lattice, based primarily on the distance between tree crowns. Transition
   matrices, size-class distributions and fragmentation indices were
   calculated. Field samples of a subset of 30 rainforest patches supported
   the accuracy of the GIS-based mapping of rainforest boundaries.
   Rainforest patches increased in size between 1964 and 2004 by an average
   of 28.8\%, with an average area increase of 4.0 ha. The expansion is
   likely to have been primarily driven by increases in variables such as
   rainfall and atmospheric CO2, but has been strongly mediated by fire
   regime. This project has provided land managers with an appreciation of
   the extent and causes of landscape-scale changes to rainforest
   boundaries. This will contribute to `adaptive management' programs,
   especially with respect to fire management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Testing the influence of edges on animal distributions depends on our
   capacity to quantify `edge', particularly in heterogeneous landscapes.
   Habitat quality is likely to differ in instances where edges are abrupt
   and anthropogenic in origin, versus diffuse, disturbance-created edges.
   We tested whether or not structurally distinct edge types influence
   northern spotted owl habitat selection and whether the relationship
   between edge type and use varied across spatial scales relevant to owl
   foraging (< 3 ha) and home range selection (50-800 ha).
   We used remotely sensed disturbance severity data to define two distinct
   edge types, `hard' and `diffuse', following a 11,000 ha fire and
   subsequent salvage logging in southern Oregon. The approach quantifies
   the steepness of gradients directly by measuring the `slope' of change
   in disturbance severity. We tested the degree to which 23 radio-collared
   spotted owls responded to edge characteristics caused by fire and
   logging.
   Spotted owls showed a strong negative association with hard edge, even
   after accounting for habitat suitability and other confounding
   variables. However, this negative relationship was highly
   scale-dependent; spotted owls were resilient to hard edges at broad
   scales, but avoided the same feature at fine scales. On the other hand,
   spotted owls showed a positive association with diffuse edge, especially
   at broader scales.
   Differential use of edge types indicates that owls favor disturbances
   that create diffuse edge habitat (e.g. low and mixed-severity fire) and
   rather than abrupt boundaries created by high severity disturbance.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{99-109}},

Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is increasingly implemented to reverse habitat
   loss and concomitant declines in biological diversity. Typically,
   restoration success is evaluated by measuring the abundance and/or
   diversity of a single taxon. However, for a restoration to be successful
   and persistent, critical ecosystem functions such as animal-mediated
   pollination must be maintained. In this review, we focus on three
   aspects of pollination within ecological restorations. First, we address
   the need to measure pollination directly in restored habitats. Proxies
   such as pollinator abundance and richness do not always accurately
   assess pollination function. Pollen supplementation experiments, pollen
   deposition studies, and pollen transport networks are more robust
   methods for assessing pollination function within restorations. Second,
   we highlight how local-scale management and landscape-level factors may
   influence pollination within restorations. Local-scale management
   actions such as prescribed fire and removal of non-native species can
   have large impacts on pollinator communities and ultimately on
   pollination services. In addition, landscape context including proximity
   and connectivity to natural habitats may be an important factor for land
   managers and conservation practitioners to consider to maximize
   restoration success. Third, as climate change is predicted to be a
   primary driver of future loss in biodiversity, we discuss the potential
   effects climate change may have on animal-mediated pollination within
   restorations. An increased mechanistic understanding of how climate
   change affects pollination and incorporation of climate change
   predictions will help practitioners design stable, functioning
   restorations into the future.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted in 2009 to gather information on long-term gopher
   tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) population dynamics, burrow distribution,
   and habitat use at Plum Creek/Lochloosa, a pine (Pinus elliottii; Pinus
   palustris) plantation in northern Florida. Mark recapture surveys were
   conducted on this study site during the 1980s, and a follow-up survey
   was done in 1992. The ca. 66-ha study area is a mosaic of moderately
   well-drained and poorly drained soils, and it has had a history of
   clear-cutting and replanting. Recent management activities included a
   tree thinning in 2008 and a controlled burn in winter 2009. We located
   gopher tortoise burrows during late April and early May 2009, and
   captured tortoises in pitfall or wire traps during May July. Fifty-two
   tortoises were captured on the study site and 4 others in an adjacent
   pine plantation across a paved rural road. Seventeen of the tortoises
   (33\%) had been previously marked, including a male marked as a mature
   adult in 1982. Most (88\%) marked individuals were found in the same
   approximate location (within 200 m) as during earlier surveys, despite
   the silviculture-related habitat changes over time. Only 8\% of all
   marked (n = 211) tortoises were recaptured in 2009. Recapture rates were
   4\% for tortoises marked when immature, 10\% for adult males, and 21\%
   for adult females. Drill marks held up relatively well in adult
   tortoises but were difficult to discern in some tortoises marked as
   juveniles. Size and sex class distributions of tortoises captured in
   2009 were different from those observed during 1981-1987 and 1992,
   primarily because fewer juveniles were captured in 2009. This follow-up
   survey indicated that viable gopher tortoise populations can persist on
   sites undergoing intensive silviculture, and it further substantiated
   tortoise use of windrow berms, ecotones, and relatively well-drained

Abstract = {{We followed how forest thinning, repeated twice during a period of 93
   years, altered understorey plant community composition, affected the
   succession of forest understorey vegetation and the accumulation of logs
   in the long-term. The study was carried out in northern Finland by
   resampling 20 permanent experimental plots, established after a wildfire
   in 1920. Understorey vegetation was inventoried in 1961, 1986 and 2013
   with forest thinning treatments done in 1953 and 1987, using four and
   three different harvesting intensities, respectively. We found
   succession to override the effects of forest logging until the latest
   study period (2013). We observed negligible long-term effects of logging
   on understorey communities during the two mid-successional stages (1961,
   1986), when the forest was 41 and 66 years old respectively. The impacts
   of logging on understorey vegetation were strongest in the latest
   successional stage (2013), the forest being at the age of 93 years. In
   the latest successional stage (2013) logged plots had less coarse woody
   debris than unlogged plots. Forest management thus influenced the key
   feature for forest biodiversity and potential habitats for endangered
   species. These findings are of major interest since the studies of
   long-term impacts of less intensive forest management practices are
   scarce. Our results suggest that in addition to possible immediate
   impacts, harvesting treatments have legacy effects (subtle or delayed
   inherited effects of forestry in the past) that influence the forest
   under storey vegetation community composition and the amount of coarse
   woody debris. This finding deserves special attention when planning of
   species conservation, multiple use of forests and sustainable forestry.}},

Abstract = {{Although studies have addressed effects of abrupt transitions in habitat
   type (e.g., forest-clear-cut or forest-field edges) on amphibian
   movements, little is known about effects of more subtle habitat
   transitions on patterns of migration and habitat use in amphibians. We
   used radiotelemetry to study movement patterns of juvenile gopher frogs
   (Rana capito) emigrating from ponds that were surrounded by longleaf
   pine (Pinus palustris) forest that varied in structure as a result of
   fire suppression. Our primary purpose was to determine if frogs emigrate
   directionally from their natal ponds and select habitat at random during
   their first month following metamorphosis. We found that frogs emigrated
   in nonrandom directions from ponds that were surrounded by heterogeneous
   habitat and selected fire-maintained habitat that was associated with an
   open canopy, few hardwood trees, small amounts of leaf litter, and large
   amounts of wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana). Fire-maintained habitat
   contained higher densities of burrows excavated by gopher tortoises
   (Gopherus polyphemus) and small mammals, which are the primary refuge
   sites for both juvenile and adult gopher frogs. Frogs moved up to 691 m
   from their natal ponds, frequently crossed dirt roads, and even seemed
   to use these roads as migration corridors. To maintain suitable
   terrestrial habitat for gopher frogs, including habitat used by
   migrating individuals, it is important to apply frequent prescribed fire
   to uplands surrounding breeding ponds that lead all the way to the edges
   of breeding ponds, as well as through ponds during periodic droughts.

Abstract = {{Modern climate change will increase temperatures, as well as the
   frequency and severity of droughts and wildfires across the semiarid
   montane regions of the southwestern United States. Predictions of
   reduced habitat suitability and increases in extinctions precipitated by
   climate change derive from modeled responses to these conditions,
   especially increased temperatures. What is often lacking are empirical
   tests of those modeled predictions. Here I report findings from surveys
   of montane lizard assemblages during a period of increased temperatures,
   extended drought, and including a wildfire. I selected survey routes
   that included upper-elevation limits for western fence lizards
   (Sceloporus occidentalis), granite spiny lizards (Sceloporus orcuttii),
   and side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), as well as the lower
   limits for southern sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus vandenburgianus), to
   measure the extent to which habitat occupancy shifted as drought
   conditions changed over 4 years. At the onset of drought, the abundance
   of all species declined. After initial declines, populations stabilized
   and I observed recruitment, positive population growth, and elevation
   shifts with only modest increases in rainfall. Once the drought abated,
   there were further increases in recruitment and population growth, but a
   colder winter and heavy snows in 2017 were coincident with declines and
   range contractions in both western fence and side-blotched lizards on
   the higher-elevation survey route. There was no indication that any of
   these species' populations were at risk of local extinctions; rather,
   shifts at range margins and use of microclimates revealed resilience and
   mechanisms of how these species might deal with future conditions,
   including occupying climate refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Adult western jewel butterflies Hypochrysops halyaetus Hewitson were
   studied in the Koondoola Regional Bushland Reserve on the northern
   outskirts of the Perth metropolitan area, Australia, in 1999. The
   butterfly is myrmecophilous, and the southern (Perth) form is considered
   to be `Vulnerable'. Butterfly dispersal, distribution, population size
   and habitat preferences were estimated using mark-recapture techniques.
   Butterflies were capable of moving large distances, and were widespread
   within the reserve but with a low density; however, one small physical
   area (80 x 20 m) contained a colony with large numbers of individuals.
   This colony, and an adjacent area of bush, was subject to a detailed
   microdistribution study: 1158 butterflies were marked within it over a
   25-day period. The small size of the microdistribution study area
   compromised statistical independence assumptions: spatial
   autocorrelation was tested for and corrected, where appropriate, using a
   Markov-chain Monte-Carlo approach. Sex differences were evident in
   spatial autocorrelation: female data were not spatially autocorrelated,
   whilst male data was. The latter probably reflects the impact of the
   perching mode of mate location employed by males. Butterflies appeared
   to prefer rather degraded bush typical of a post fire/disturbance regime
   with high densities of the host plant Jacksonia sternbergiana. Males
   were positively correlated with the proportion of bare ground, again
   probably relating to preferred perching sites for mate location. Females
   were negatively correlated with Conospremum stoechadis probably
   indicating dense ground cover in degraded areas and Xanthorrhoea
   preissii probably an indicator at the site of more mature vegetation.
   Reserve management to improve vegetation quality may threaten the
   persistence of the butterfly within the reserve, whilst controlled
   burning to create even quite small new areas of habitat in an urban
   situation may be difficult to achieve. The creation of suitable habitat
   may be possible using mechanical means, provided the action of fire is
   not an essential component of habitat creation. As the western jewel
   appears to prefer degraded vegetation, it is possible that there may be
   opportunities for this species' expansion within the urban environment
   provided that its mutualistic ant partner is also present. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Where data and information are lacking, structured expert risk
   assessments can provide a powerful tool to progress natural resource
   planning. In many situations, practitioners make informal assessments of
   risk within small groups that typically constitute employees. In this
   study, we report on three small (in terms of experts) structured
   expert-based risk assessment case studies conducted by expert employees
   of a not-for-profit organisation (Australian Wildlife Conservancy) to
   demonstrate the utility of the approach. The case studies were carried
   out for three wildlife sanctuaries managed by AWC: Faure Island,
   Karakamia and Paruna. The likelihood that a set of direct risk factors
   would cause management failure for sets of important wildlife elements
   in the three sanctuaries was elicited from the small group of ecological
   experts. The analysis was couched in terms of a management aim to not
   lose species from each wildlife element over the management period of 25
   years with current management. The experts believed, in particular, that
   increasing temperature and decreasing water availability associated with
   climate change were likely to impact significantly upon the vegetation
   elements and water-reliant fauna associated with the sanctuaries. Some
   vegetation elements were also thought likely to be at risk of
   over-grazing, unsuitable fire regimes and, in some cases, disease. In
   addition to predation by exotic predators at one sanctuary, the experts
   identified additional direct risk factors for various fauna elements
   associated with expected changes to the vegetation elements, including
   reduction in food availability, nesting habitat, and generally important
   life media. From the risk analyses, a preliminary conceptual model was
   developed to underpin monitoring and to indicate areas for possible
   management intervention and research. The case studies demonstrate that
   even in a small workplace team, structured risk assessments can be
   efficiently accomplished and can provide expedient and transparent
   information that effectively captures and aggregates the views of the

Title = {{Variability in Mixed Conifer Spatial Structure Changes Understory Light
   Environments}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In fire-adapted conifer forests of the Western U.S., changing land use
   has led to increased forest densities and fuel conditions partly
   responsible for increasing the extent of high-severity wildfires in the
   region. In response, land managers often use mechanical thinning
   treatments to reduce fuels and increase overstory structural complexity,
   which can help improve stand resilience and restore complex spatial
   patterns that once characterized these stands. The outcomes of these
   treatments can vary greatly, resulting in a large gradient in
   aggregation of residual overstory trees. However, there is limited
   information on how a range of spatial outcomes from restoration
   treatments can influence structural complexity and tree regeneration
   dynamics in mixed conifer stands. In this study, we model understory
   light levels across a range of forest density in a stem-mapped dry mixed
   conifer forest and apply this model to simulated stem maps that are
   similar in residual basal area yet vary in degree of spatial complexity.
   We found that light availability was best modeled by residual stand
   density index and that consideration of forest structure at multiple
   spatial scales is important for predicting light availability. Second,
   we found that restoration treatments differing in spatial pattern may
   differ markedly in their achievement of objectives such as density
   reduction, maintenance of horizontal and tree size complexity, and
   creation of microsite conditions favorable to shade-intolerant species,
   with several notable tradeoffs. These conditions in turn have cascading
   effects on regeneration dynamics, treatment longevity, fire behavior,
   and resilience to disturbances. In our study, treatments with high
   aggregation of residual trees best balanced multiple objectives
   typically used in ponderosa pine and dry mixed conifer forests.
   Simulation studies that consider a wide range of possible spatial
   patterns can complement field studies and provide predictions of the
   impacts of mechanical treatments on a large range of potential
   ecological effects.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation practitioners frequently have limited information on the
   structure and function of the ecosystems they wish to preserve, and as a
   result, they may use shortcuts to guide conservation actions. One such
   shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions
   are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the
   entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and
   resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so
   too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The
   federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has
   been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine
   ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on
   early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We
   examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida.
   Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups
   selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and
   lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no
   evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in
   degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of
   hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat
   associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous
   findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area,
   namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below
   those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker
   has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf
   ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that
   benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in
   restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of
   hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism.}},

Abstract = {{Early dry season fires are a common land management regime employed
   across the tropical savannas of northern Australia. The rationale is
   that this reduces fuel loads and so reduces fire risk in the latter part
   of the dry season. Despite the acceptance of fire as a major management
   tool the ecological effects of fire remain uncertain. Vegetation patches
   and their associated macroinvertebrates play a critical role in the
   capture and recycling of water and nutrients. The aim of this study was
   to examine the responses of soil macroinvertebrates, within different
   types of vegetation patches, to early dry season fires in tropical
   savanna woodland in northern Australia. The abundance of major
   macroinvertebrate taxa and functional groups, and taxon richness were
   quantified in three vegetation patch types 2 weeks before and 2 weeks
   after burning. Termites dominated the soil macroinvertebrate assemblage
   sampled. Fire led to significant decreases in ant and spider abundances
   and overall taxon richness. Functional group analyses showed significant
   overall declines in the abundances of macropredators and litter
   transformers. There were also interactions between fire and patch type;
   in tree patches, fire significantly reduced total macroinvertebrate
   abundance, as well as the abundance of termites and ecosystem engineers.
   These changes in soil macroinvertebrates will potentially influence
   patch functionality, with important implications for soil processes and

   sagebrush ecosystems}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent policy has focused on prevention of wildfire in the sagebrush
   steppe in an effort to protect habitat for the greater sage grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus). Historically, fire return intervals in
   Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis)
   ecosystems were 50-100 yr or more, but invasive species, climate change,
   and a legacy of intensive grazing practices have led to degraded
   rangeland condition, altered fire regimes and fire effects, and declines
   in sagebrush cover. Little is known about the long-term impacts of fire
   in this ecosystem in areas where grazing pressure has been removed, few
   invasive species exist, and fire return intervals are maintained. In
   this study, we quantified vegetation composition prior to prescribed
   burning, 1 year following fire, and 17 years after fire in a
   native-dominated Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystem at Hart Mountain
   National Antelope Refuge, Oregon, United States. Seventeen years
   following fire, the ecosystem was dominated by native herbaceous
   vegetation, with 8.3\% cover of broad-leaved forbs and bunchgrasses in
   the understory, compared to just 3.8\% cover of native herbaceous
   vegetation in unburned controls. Invasive annual grass cover ranged from
   0.2\% to 8.4\% across all treatments and years (P = 0.56). One year
   following fire, the distance from a randomly located point and the
   nearest mature sagebrush was 16.6 m, but by 17 years after the fire,
   that distance had decreased to 2.5 m. Seventeen years after fires, shrub
   cover was 0.4-4\% in burned plots compared to 13-24\% in unburned
   controls. Collectively, these data demonstrate that good condition
   ungrazed Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities exhibited resilience
   following fire and maintained a native-dominated mosaic of shrubs,
   bunchgrasses, and forbs. Further, unburned control plots were dominated
   by woody vegetation and exhibited losses in herbaceous understory,
   possibly indicating that they are outside of their natural fire return
   interval. Our results illustrate that management of all habitat
   components, including natural disturbance and a mosaic of successional
   stages, is important for persistent resilience and that suppression of
   all fires in the sagebrush steppe may create long-term losses of
   heterogeneity in good condition Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Extensive fires in 1988 burned 22\% of the northern winter range in
   Yellowstone National Park, which provides critical winter habitat for
   one of the largest free-ranging herds of elk (Cervus elaphus) in North
   America. The winter of 1988-89 was moderately severe, and the
   combination of forage loss due to fire plus deep snows led to high elk
   mortality (similar to 40\%). We designed a simulation experiment to
   explore how elk mortality that winter might have been different under
   alternative weather conditions, spatial patterning of the burn, and
   initial elk numbers. The simulations were performed with the Northern
   Yellowstone Park model (NOYELP), a spatially explicit model of forage
   availability, snow conditions, elk movement and foraging, and elk
   energetics. Results supported earlier findings indicating that snow
   depth and water equivalent were major determinants of elk survival: in a
   mild winter scenario, there was almost no mortality even with forage
   loss from the fire, but when the most severe winter in recent history
   was simulated, calf mortality approached 100\%. Under moderate to severe
   winter conditions, fire pattern and initial elk density also were
   important. Burning 22\% of the northern range at random or in single
   large patches produced higher mortality than did the actual burn
   pattern. This study also showed that mortality increased nonlinearly as
   initial elk density increased, with thresholds in density at which
   mortality went up sharply. Modeling experiments of this kind can help
   managers of natural areas similar to Yellowstone National Park
   anticipate the effects of future large-scale fires, and can provide
   insights into likely effects of management activities such as prescribed

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To describe an animal health database used to facilitate effective
   disaster response and retrospective analysis of data concerning animals
   other than cats and dogs affected by the 2018 California Camp Fire.
   ANIMALS
   Veterinary medical entries (n = 206) for evacuated or rescued animals
   (151) of various species, including avian, bovine, camelid, caprine,
   equine, ovine, and porcine species, temporarily housed at the Butte
   County fairgrounds in Gridley, Calif.
   PROCEDURES
   Case data were collected via a standardized form by volunteers with the
   University of California-Davis Veterinary Emergency Response Team during
   triage and treatment of animals brought to the shelter. Collected data
   were entered into a database. Multiple correspondence analysis was used
   to evaluate associations among patient species, types and severity of
   injuries, and behavior.
   RESULTS
   Burns, respiratory disease, gastrointestinal illnesses, and lacerations
   were the most prevalent illnesses and injuries among the overall shelter
   population for the first 12 days of the Camp Fire. Ovine patients were
   more likely to have had respiratory illness than were other species. The
   most prevalent medical conditions among equine patients were lacerations
   and gastrointestinal illnesses. Severe burns were most common among
   porcine, camelid, and avian patients. The temporal distribution of cases
   suggested the immediate evacuation of equine species and the delayed
   movement of bovine and avian species to the shelter.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Collection of animal health information through the database allowed
   assessment of prevalent medical conditions among various farm animals
   following a wildfire. Adaptation of this database to other disasters
   could improve emergency response protocols by providing guidance for
   management of resources and allow retrospective assessment for response
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem engineers are species that have a role in creating and
   maintaining certain habitat traits that are important for other species.
   Burrowing species do this by creating subterranean refugia from
   predation and thermal extremes, but also providing foraging
   opportunities through soil movement and by increasing local landscape
   heterogeneity. In this study, we used camera traps to monitor the
   burrows of greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis), a vulnerable Australian
   marsupial, in an area subject to frequent disturbance by fire. We tested
   the hypothesis that bilby burrows provide refuge for other species and
   therefore their presence increases biodiversity. In total, 45 taxa - 22
   bird, 16 reptile and 7 mammal taxa - were recorded interacting with 127
   burrows across 7 sites. Species richness was greater at burrows compared
   with vegetation away from burrows, while abundance was no different.
   There was no difference in species assemblage for bilby burrows that
   were actively maintained by bilbies compared with abandoned burrows,
   although there was more activity at bilby maintained burrows. A wildfire
   allowed us to test the ad hoc hypothesis that the use of bilby burrows
   was greater when vegetation cover was removed by fire. We recorded
   significant differences in species assemblage interacting with burrows
   after fire, although overall species richness and abundance did not
   change. The response of individual species was variable; for example,
   burrows provide a refuge for smaller species (such as mice and small
   reptiles), and may therefore protect them from the effects of fire.
   Where they persist, bilbies provide an important ecosystem engineering
   service, as their burrows support a broad range of species. Further
   reduction in the distribution of the bilby is therefore likely to have a
   flow-on effect on biodiversity, impacting species that use their burrows
   for refuge.}},

Abstract = {{The Bear Valley National Wildlife Refuge in southern Oregon supports one

   roosting bald eagles (Haliacetus leucocephalus) in the United States.
   Past selective logging and fire suppression in mixed-conifer forests
   used by eagles at this roost have altered important roost
   characteristics such that declines in roost suitability will continue
   without future management. Therefore, to evaluate long-term suitability
   of the roost environment and to develop management prescriptions, we
   characterized habitat features on 3 spatial scales: (1) attributes of
   trees used by eagles for roosting, (2) vegetation within 18 m of roost
   trees (i.e., roost sites), and (3) relative distribution of selected
   characteristics within subroosts of the main roost. Roost trees had
   greater diameter at breast height (dbh), more open branching structures,
   and were taller than unused trees, Roost trees were primarily
   Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) that were smaller in diameter and
   younger than other species of trees used for roosting; however, trees
   greater than or equal to 80 cm dbh were used by eagles. regardless of

   tall (>30 m) trees of all species, greater densities of Douglas-fir that
   was 20-30 m tall, and a combination of greater densities of snags and
   Douglas-fir that was 20-30 m tall. The subroost where a most site was
   located also may have affected the likelihood of a site being used by
   eagles due to differences in densities of species of roost trees.
   Species composition and abundance of species of roost trees varied among
   subroosts due primarily to selective logging of Douglas-fir and
   ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and to longterm fire suppression. We
   recommend limited thinning, prescribed fire, and seeding with species of

Abstract = {{Ungulates typically migrate to maximize nutritional intake when forage
   varies seasonally. In western North America, however, increasing numbers
   of ungulates reside on low-elevation winter range year-round rather than
   migrating. These residents often occupy irrigated agricultural areas,
   but it is not known whether the nutrition provided by agricultural land
   exceeds that gained by migration. We evaluated the nutrition available
   to a partially migratory population of elk (Cervus canadensis) in
   west-central Montana where some individuals summered on low-elevation
   agricultural lands, whereas others summered on traditional
   higher-elevation ranges. We sampled elk forage plants from ground plots
   and adult female elk movements from global positioning system (GPS)
   collar locations during late summer for 2 years. We tested for
   differences in the nutrition provided by 11 vegetative communities
   commonly available to elk in the Rocky Mountains and the nutrition
   available in areas used by individuals whose behaviors ranged from
   residency to migration. We found the nutrition available to elk
   decreased along the continuum from resident to migratory behavior,
   contrary to our hypothesis that all behaviors would provide access to
   equivalent forage quality. The relatively small summer home ranges of
   migrants suggest other factors (e.g., decreased competition) may
   compensate for their lower nutritional value, because the size of a home
   range is often inversely related to its fitness benefits. We found
   irrigated agriculture provided the highest forage quality in low
   elevations, but recently burned (1-6 yr prior) dry forests at higher
   elevations provided forage quality approximately equivalent to that of
   irrigated agriculture. Excluding elk from irrigated agricultural areas
   should therefore reduce nutritional incentives for elk to reside at low
   elevations year-round. Additionally, fire in higher-elevation dry
   forests may temporarily increase forage quality for elk and improve
   nutritional benefits of migratory behavior. Our results indicate land
   management practices can affect nutritionally mediated fitness benefits
   of differing behaviors in partially migratory populations of ungulates.

Abstract = {{A recurrent challenge in the conservation of wide-ranging, imperiled
   species is understanding which habitats to protect and whether we are
   capable of restoring degraded landscapes. For Greater Sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern in the
   western United States, we approached this problem by developing
   multi-scale empirical models of occupancy in 211 randomly located plots
   within a 40 million ha portion of the species' range. We then used these
   models to predict sage-grouse habitat quality at 826 plots associated
   with 101 post-wildfire seeding projects implemented from 1990 to 2003.
   We also compared conditions at restoration sites to published habitat
   guidelines. Sage-grouse occupancy was positively related to plot- and
   landscape-level dwarf sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula, A. nova, A.
   tripartita) and big sagebrush steppe prevalence, and negatively
   associated with non-native plants and human development. The predicted
   probability of sage-grouse occupancy at treated plots was low on average
   (0.09) and not substantially different from burned areas that had not
   been treated. Restoration sites with quality habitat tended to occur at
   higher elevation locations with low annual temperatures, high spring
   precipitation, and high plant diversity. Of 313 plots seeded after fire,
   none met all sagebrush guidelines for breeding habitats, but
   approximately 50\% met understory guidelines, particularly for perennial
   grasses. This pattern was similar for summer habitat. Less than 2\% of
   treated plots met winter habitat guidelines. Restoration actions did not
   increase the probability of burned areas meeting most guideline
   criteria. The probability of meeting guidelines was influenced by a
   latitudinal gradient, climate, and topography. Our results suggest that
   sage-grouse are relatively unlikely to use many burned areas within 20
   years of fire, regardless of treatment. Understory habitat conditions
   are more likely to be adequate than overstory conditions, but in most
   climates, establishing forbs and reducing cheatgrass dominance is
   unlikely. Reestablishing sagebrush cover will require more than 20 years
   using past restoration methods. Given current fire frequencies and
   restoration capabilities, protection of landscapes containing a mix of
   dwarf sagebrush and big sagebrush steppe, minimal human development, and
   low non-native plant cover may provide the best opportunity for
   conservation of sage-grouse habitats.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, the loss of habitat heterogeneity resulting from
   homogeneous livestock grazing is one factor contributing to steep
   population declines of many grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing
   is a management technique that uses historic grassland disturbance as a
   model to create heterogeneous grassland composition and structure,
   providing for the diverse habitat requirements of grassland birds.
   Though this management technique has been used successfully in
   relatively extensive grasslands, its utility on smaller grassland
   patches is less clear. We examined the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to
   restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity in
   relatively small pastures (15-32 ha) in a grassland landscape fragmented
   by cultivation and tree encroachment. In 2006, we established 12
   experimental pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and
   northern Missouri, with 4 pastures in each of three treatments: 1)
   patch-burn graze, with spatially discrete fires and free access by
   cattle (the fire-grazing interaction), 2) graze-and-burn, with free
   access by cattle and a single burn of the entire pasture every third
   year, and 3) burn-only, with a single burn of the entire pasture every
   third year and no grazing. Patch-burn grazing in the first phase of the
   project (2007-2009) did not generate habitat heterogeneity or
   significant differences in bird diversity. From 2010 to 2013, stocking
   rates were reduced to increase residual vegetation in unburned patches
   at the end of the grazing season to increase heterogeneity. Habitat
   heterogeneity in patch-burn graze pastures subsequently increased
   relative to other treatments. Concomitantly, diversity of obligate
   grassland birds also increased in patch-burn graze pastures and was
   greatest in 2012 and 2013. We conclude that the fire-grazing interaction
   can be used to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird
   diversity, even in relatively small grassland patches embedded in a
   highly fragmented landscape. (C) 2016 The Society for Range Management.

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are
   critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest
   ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to
   be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe
   show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified
   markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark
   beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the
   main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest
   structure and composition associated with management activities such as
   promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. `forest
   change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here,
   we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same
   order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance
   damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the
   increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and
   composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle
   damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when
   conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility
   coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more
   disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's
   forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon
   storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting
   drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for
   climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding sexual differences in habitat use is important for
   effective conservation management, particularly with regard to
   polygynous species, the sexes of which may differ in their responses to
   land-use change. We examined sex-specific habitat use in the critically
   endangered Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), a polygynous
   bustard whose most important population occurs in traditionally farmed
   grasslands in the Tonle Sap floodplain, Cambodia. This habitat is
   undergoing rapid conversion to intensive dry-season rice production.
   Using radiotelemetry, we compared male and female breeding-season
   habitat selection and home-range sizes and configurations. The sexes
   differed in their spatial use of the lek and their ability to utilize
   anthropogenic habitat features. Both sexes avoided intensive dry-season
   rice fields. Males selected habitats related to low-intensity human
   activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females selected unburned
   grassland but also used unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season
   rice head-ponds. These differences reflect the species' breeding system,
   with males using open areas for display and females selecting cover. Our
   findings demonstrate the importance of the landscape heterogeneity
   associated with traditional human activity in maintaining the habitat
   mosaics necessary for the contrasting breeding-season requirements of
   male and female Bengal Floricans. Two-thirds of tagged females may have
   left the lek to nest elsewhere, which suggests that protecting habitat
   in which males display will not be a sufficient conservation response
   for such lekking species. Both sexes are detrimentally affected by
   agricultural intensification within the Tonle Sap, and encouragement of
   industrial rice production to spare more ``natural{''} habitats
   elsewhere is likely to be counterproductive for this globally threatened
   flagship species. Received 5 February 2008, accepted 28 July}},

Abstract = {{Wyoming is the least populated state in the U.S. with similar to 250,000
   km(2) of relatively undisturbed ecosystems and wildlife habitat as well
   as an abundance of natural resources. Increasing demand for natural
   resources has resulted in more resource extraction activities, including
   surface mining and oil \& gas drilling, and associated disturbance in
   these ecosystems, which, along with wildfire, invasive plants, and
   infrastructure development have lead to decreases in both the amount of
   habitat available and the quality of remaining habitat. These are
   thought to be the primary factors responsible for 50\% population loss
   of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in its historical
   range. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), in 2010, determined
   the Greater Sage-Grouse was warranted for Endangered Species listing but
   precluded because other species were under more severe threat. Inclusion
   of the Greater Sage-Grouse as an Endangered Species would likely result
   in considerable negative economic impacts in the state of Wyoming which
   depends on extractive natural resource production for economic health.
   To conserve the Greater Sage-Grouse and it's habitat in Wyoming, the
   state developed a natural resource policy titled ``Sage-Grouse Core Area
   Strategy and Governor's Executive Order for Sage-Grouse{''} which
   involves protecting existing wildlife habitat and ecological restoration
   of habitat affecting by resource extraction and other disturbance
   factors mentioned above. The policy being carried out was developed by a
   collaborative team of state and federal agencies, industry,
   non-governmental organizations, and private landowners known as the
   Sage-Grouse Implementation Team. Specifics of restoration efforts are
   discussed.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},

Abstract = {{The Appalachian Cooperative Grouse Research Project (ACGRP) was a
   multistate cooperative effort initiated in 1996 to investigate the
   apparent decline of ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) and improve
   management throughout the central and southern Appalachian region (i.e.,
   parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Kentucky, West Virginia,
   Virginia, and North Carolina, USA). Researchers have offered several
   hypotheses to explain the low abundance of ruffed grouse in the region,
   including low availability of early-successional forests due to changes
   in land use, additive harvest mortality, low productivity and
   recruitment, and nutritional stress. As part of the ACGRP, we
   investigated ruffed grouse population ecology. Our objectives were to
   estimate reproductive rates, estimate survival and cause-specific
   mortality rates, examine if ruffed grouse harvest in the Appalachian
   region is compensatory, and estimate ruffed grouse finite population
   growth. We trapped > 3,000 ruffed grouse in autumn (Sep-Nov) and spring
   (Feb-Mar) from 1996 to September 2002 on 12 study areas. We determined
   the age and gender of each bird and fitted them with necklace-style
   radiotransmitters and released them at the trap site. We tracked ruffed
   grouse >= 2 times per week using handheld radiotelemetry equipment and
   gathered data on reproduction, recruitment, survival, and mortality.
   Ruffed grouse population dynamics in the Appalachian region differed
   from the central portion of the species' range (i.e., northern United
   States and Canada). Ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region had lower
   productivity and recruitment, but higher survival than reported for
   populations in the Great Lakes region and southern Canada. Population
   dynamics differed between oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) and
   mixed-mesophytic forest associations within the southern and central
   Appalachian region. Productivity and recruitment were lower in
   oak-hickory forests, but adult survival was higher than in
   mixed-mesophytic forests. Furthermore, ruffed grouse productivity and
   recruitment were more strongly related to hard mast (i.e., acorn)
   production in oak-hickory forests than in mixed-mesophytic forests. The
   leading cause of ruffed grouse mortality was avian predation (44\% of
   known mortalities). Harvest mortality accounted for 12\% ofall known
   mortalities and appeared to be compensatory. Population models indicated
   ruffed grouse populations in the Appalachian region are declining
   (lambda = 0.7-0.95), but differences in model estimates highlighted the
   need for improved understanding of annual productivity and recruitment.
   We posit ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region exhibit a clinal
   population structure characterized by changes in life-history
   strategies. Changes in life history strategies are in response to
   gradual changes in forest structure, quality of food resources, snowfall
   and accumulation patterns, and predator communities. Management efforts
   should focus on creating a mosaic of forest stand ages across the
   landscape to intersperse habitat resources including nesting and brood
   cover, adult escape cover, roosting sites, and, most importantly, food
   resources. Land managers can intersperse habitat resources through a
   combination of clearcutting, shelterwood harvests, group selection, and
   timber stand improvement (including various thinnings and prescribed
   fire). Managers should maintain current ruffed grouse harvest rates
   while providing high quality hunting opportunities. We define high
   quality hunting as low hunting pressure, low vehicle traffic, and high
   flush rates.
   Managers ca provide high quality hunting opportunities through use of
   road closures in conjunction with habitat management.}},

Abstract = {{Postfire salvage logging is currently a controversial issue because of
   the impact that the removal of snags has on ecosystem structure and
   function. Although it is a common practice worldwide, the absence of
   comparisons across regions hinders the development of broad
   generalizations. Here we compare bird response to postfire salvage
   logging in two regions with significant differences in landscape and
   bird communities, the Mediterranean Basin and the Rocky Mountains. The
   Mediterranean Basin features a landscape dominated by a mosaic of
   small-sized forests, farmland and shrublands, while the Rocky Mountains
   have large extensions of continuous forests. Bird conservation
   priorities are also different. In the Mediterranean Basin, priorities
   are oriented toward farmland birds, while they are oriented toward
   fire-specialists in the Rocky Mountains. We used databases describing
   bird species occurrence in burned forests from both regions and defined
   three groups of species based on their level of association with snags.
   We then compared the richness of each group among logged and unlogged
   sites, and also between regions. We found a higher proportion of species
   that showed some degree of association with snags in burned forests of
   the Rocky Mountains than in the Mediterranean Basin. Highly
   snag-associated birds from both regions showed a common negative
   response to salvage logging. Not snag-associated species increased in
   salvaged areas, but only in the Mediterranean Basin. The general
   negative effect of salvage logging on forest-dwelling species that are
   associated with trees or snags is a noteworthy pattern given the big
   differences between regions. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean, some
   threatened farmland species benefit from logging, so the overall effect
   of the removal of snags appears to be relatively more detrimental to
   birds in the Rocky Mountains. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{71-90}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Pricing greenhouse gas emissions is a burgeoning and possibly lucrative
   financial means for climate change mitigation. Emissions pricing is
   being used to fund emissions-abatement technologies and to modify land
   management to improve carbon sequestration and retention. Here we
   discuss the principal land-management options under existing and
   realistic future emissions-price legislation in Australia, and examine
   them with respect to their anticipated direct and indirect effects on
   biodiversity. The main ways in which emissions price-driven changes to
   land management can affect biodiversity are through policies and
   practices for (1) environmental plantings for carbon sequestration, (2)
   native regrowth, (3) fire management, (4) forestry, (5) agricultural
   practices (including cropping and grazing), and (6) feral animal
   control. While most land-management options available to reduce net
   greenhouse gas emissions offer clear advantages to increase the
   viability of native biodiversity, we describe several caveats regarding
   potentially negative outcomes, and outline components that need to be
   considered if biodiversity is also to benefit from the new carbon
   economy. Carbon plantings will only have real biodiversity value if they
   comprise appropriate native tree species and provide suitable habitats
   and resources for valued fauna. Such plantings also risk severely
   altering local hydrology and reducing water availability. Management of
   regrowth post-agricultural abandonment requires setting appropriate
   baselines and allowing for thinning in certain circumstances, and
   improvements to forestry rotation lengths would likely increase
   carbon-retention capacity and biodiversity value. Prescribed burning to
   reduce the frequency of high-intensity wildfires in northern Australia
   is being used as a tool to increase carbon retention. Fire management in
   southern Australia is not readily amenable for maximising carbon storage
   potential, but will become increasingly important for biodiversity
   conservation as the climate warms. Carbon price-based modifications to
   agriculture that would benefit biodiversity include reductions in
   tillage frequency and livestock densities, reductions in fertiliser use,
   and retention and regeneration of native shrubs; however, anticipated
   shifts to exotic perennial grass species such as buffel grass and kikuyu
   could have net negative implications for native biodiversity. Finally,
   it is unlikely that major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions arising
   from feral animal control are possible, even though reduced densities of
   feral herbivores will benefit Australian biodiversity greatly. (C) 2013

   toumodiensis and Odontotermes aff. pauperans) was compared at baits of
   different sizes, belonging to the two most abundant tree species in this
   savanna, viz. Crossopteryx febrifuga and Piliostigma thonningii. All
   species preferred larger wood pieces. A. cavithorax was the most active
   forager on baits. Foraging activity of the mound builder, M. bellicosus
   was clearly influenced by the foraging patterns of the two underground
   fungus-growing species, A. cavithorax and O. aff. pauperans, thereby
   questioning the competitive ability of M. bellicosus, as against the
   activities of its competitors. M. bellicosus seems to be at the bottom
   of a possible competition hierarchy with regard to food niche. This
   imbalance in favour of underground species could have been increased by
   the fire regime in Lamto savanna, artificially occurring each year in
   the middle of the dry season and minimizing the abundance of large wood
   items, most preferred by Macrotermes.}},

Volume = {{131}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{76-88}},

Abstract = {{Edaphic variables figure significantly in plant community adaptations in
   tropical ecosystems but are often difficult to resolve because of the
   confounding influence of climate. Within the Chiquibul forest of Belize,
   large areas of Ultisols and Inceptisols occur juxtaposed within a larger
   zone of similar climate, permitting unambiguous assessment of edaphic
   contributions to forest composition. Wet chemical analyses, X-ray
   diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were employed to derive
   chemical (pH, exchangeable cations, CEC, total and organic C, total
   trace elements) and physical (texture, mineralogy) properties of four
   granite-derived Ustults from the Mountain Pine Ridge plateau and four
   limestone-derived Ustepts from the San Pastor region. The soils of these
   two regions support two distinct forests, each possessing a species
   composition reflecting the many contrasting physicochemical properties
   of the underlying soil. Within the Mountain Pine Ridge forest, species
   abundance and diversity is constrained by nutrient deficiencies and
   water-holding limitations imposed by the coarse textured, highly
   weathered Ultisols. As a consequence, the forest is highly adapted to
   seasonal drought, frequent fires and the significant input of
   atmospherically derived nutrients. The nutrient-rich Inceptisols of the
   San Pastor region, conversely, support an abundant and diverse evergreen
   forest, dominated by Sabal mauritiiformis, Cryosophila stauracantha and
   Manilkara spp. Moreover, the deep, fine textured soils in the
   depressions of the karstic San Pastor landscape collect and retain
   during the wet season much available water, thereby serving as refugia
   during particularly long periods of severe drought. To the extent that
   the soils of the Chiquibul region promote and maintain forest diversity,
   they also confer redundancy and resilience to these same forests and, to
   the broader ecosystem, of which they are a central part. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Environmental heterogeneity across savanna landscapes, including
   different seasonal resources at different distances to water, may play a
   critical role in maintaining the size and diversity of wildlife
   populations and the sustainability of their resource base. We
   investigated whether extensive landscapes with functionally diverse
   seasonal resources and large waterless regions can mediate the effect of
   herbivory on plant composition, structure and diversity. Vegetation
   composition, structure and richness in two different vegetation types
   (mopane and sandveld woodland) at three distance zones (0 km -5 km, 10
   km -15 km and > 20 km) from the permanent water of the Okavango Delta
   and Linyanti Swamps were surveyed. We modelled vegetation response of
   the most abundant species to herbivory in relation to distance from
   permanent water, and included fire frequency as a covariate. Trees
   favoured by elephants during the dry season occurred typically as
   immature, pollarded populations within 5 km of permanent water sources
   while mature tall populations of these species were found far from water
   (> 10 km -15 km). Similarly, short high-quality grazing grasses were
   higher in abundance within 5 km of permanent water, whereas taller
   high-quality perennial grasses peaked in abundance beyond 20 km from
   permanent water. Trends in herbaceous richness with distance from water
   were contingent upon vegetation type, while tree richness did not change
   with distance from water. Spatial refuges in waterless regions of
   landscapes facilitate the creation of heterogeneity of vegetation
   structure, composition and richness by large herds of mammalian
   herbivores. Therefore, the extension of herbivore dry season foraging
   range, for example, by the creation of artificial water points (AWP) in
   backcountry woodlands, could seriously undermine the resilience of
   landscapes to herbivory by reducing the availability of spatial refuges.
   Consequently, it reduces the resilience of herbivore and predator
   populations that depend on these spatial refuges. We strongly advise
   that future scientific work, and management and policy actions should be
   focused on the identification and sustaining of these spatial refuges in
   wildlife areas.
   Conservation implications: Management and policy actions should be
   focused on the identification and sustainability of spatial refuges in
   wildlife areas. Too many AWP in backcountry woodlands could undermine
   the resilience of landscapes to herbivory by reducing the proportion of
   landscapes beyond 15 km from permanent water.}},

Abstract = {{The tallgrass prairie historically burned every 2 to 3 y, removing the
   litter layer and leaving post-burn environments inhospitable to many
   terrestrial species. Selection pressures, such as lack of food and
   shelter and increased predation, are intensified for some species over
   limited time periods. To quantify predation pressures oil large snakes,
   artificial snakes were placed in recently burned and long-term unburned
   areas of a grassland system in northeastern Kansas. Any disturbance to
   the original placement of the model snake was considered a predation
   attempt. Statistical models were used to estimate daily survival rates
   of individual artificial snakes within both habitat types. A group
   effect (burned vs. unburned) was selected as the single top model,
   garnishing > 93\% of the support for the data. Survival estimates from
   this top model indicated artificial snakes in newly burned areas had
   significantly lower daily survival than those placed within unburned
   sites. Indirect evidence from destroyed artificial snakes indicated
   raptors were a major predator on large snakes. Overall herpetofaunal
   activity in burned areas was low during the first 20 d post-burn, with
   increasing activity throughout the rest of tire season. However,
   activity within unburned areas was constant throughout the spring.
   Burning tallgrass prairie likely increases predation pressure on large
   snakes ill the area for 1 to 2 mo following tire burn due to the lack of

Abstract = {{In the absence of wildfire, emergent wetlands in the American Midwest

   groups. Species associated with emergent wetland type, like the Sedge
   Wren (Cistothorus platensis) and LeConte's Sparrow (Ammodramus

   that require shrubs, such as the Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum)

   type on breeding birds by either burning, shearing, or both treatments

   managed and unmanaged sites completed in 1996. In addition, breeding
   bird composition was not different on sites that varied in time elapsed

Abstract = {{Semi-arid thornscrub forests occur throughout South Texas and
   northeastern Mexico and provide habitat for numerous fauna, including
   the Federally-endangered ocelot. However, <2\% of original thornscrub
   remains due to land conversion for human use. One attempt underway to
   restore thornscrub habitat around core ocelot populations in South Texas
   is the planting of thornscrub seedlings in old agricultural fields.
   However, growth and survival post-planting and effectiveness of
   restoration strategies to overcome common stressors (e.g., competition,
   herbivory, and drought) have not been evaluated. In March 2011, we
   initiated a pilot study to assess seedling growth and survival in
   response to pre-planting prescribed fire, mowing, herbicide, and shelter
   tubes aimed at alleviating stressors including invasive grass cover and
   herbivore browse. We found that a single pre-planting prescribed fire
   promoted invasive grass cover; mowing had no effect. Glyphosate reduced
   invasive grass cover, but acetic acid/orange oil was ineffective.
   Seedlings in fire plots were tallest with the largest basal diameters
   despite greater invasive grass cover. Shelter tubes promoted height
   growth, reduced browse, and increased survival. This research will help
   managers decide which restoration techniques most effectively reduce
   thornscrub seedling stressors and promote growth and survival. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession
   in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the
   design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
   In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested
   by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we
   synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed
   dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence,
   herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic
   conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as
   constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in
   a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this
   research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration
   techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by
   trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant
   forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks.
   For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination
   of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the
   likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by
   clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings
   close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20 m
   into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of
   seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the
   growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into
   grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of
   vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival.
   These experiments identified that the early-successional species
   Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore
   are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on
   abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest
   restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using
   early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling
   treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around
   vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and
   tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance
   of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and
   seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of
   native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration
   strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We use the fire ecology and biogeographical patterns of Callitris
   intratropica, a fire-sensitive conifer, and the Asian water buffalo
   (Bubalus bubalis), an introduced mega-herbivore, to examine the
   hypothesis that the continuation of Aboriginal burning and cultural
   integration of buffalo contribute to greater savanna heterogeneity and
   diversity in central Arnhem Land (CAL) than Kakadu National Park (KNP).
   The `Stone Country' of the Arnhem Plateau, extending from KNP to CAL, is
   a globally renowned social-ecological system, managed for millennia by
   Bininj-Kunwok Aboriginal clans. Regional species declines have been
   attributed to the cessation of patchy burning by Aborigines. Whereas the
   KNP Stone Country is a modern wilderness, managed through prescribed
   burning and buffalo eradication, CAL remains a stronghold for Aboriginal
   management where buffalo have been culturally integrated. We surveyed
   the plant community and the presence of buffalo tracks among intact and
   fire-damaged C. intratropica groves and the savanna matrix in KNP and
   CAL. Aerial surveys of C. intratropica grove condition were used to
   examine the composition of savanna vegetation across the Stone Country.
   The plant community in intact C. intratropica groves had higher stem
   counts of shrubs and small trees and higher proportions of
   fire-sensitive plant species than degraded groves and the savanna
   matrix. A higher proportion of intact C. intratropica groves in CAL
   therefore indicated greater gamma diversity and habitat heterogeneity
   than the KNP Stone Country. Interactions among buffalo, fire, and C.
   intratropica suggested that buffalo also contributed to these patterns.
   Our results suggest linkages between ecological and cultural integrity
   at broad spatial scales across a complex landscape. Buffalo may provide
   a tool for mitigating destructive fires; however, their interactions
   require further study. Sustainability in the Stone Country depends upon
   adaptive management that rehabilitates the coupling of indigenous
   culture, disturbance, and natural resources.}},

   important for forest conservation and restoration, with specific
   attention to refuge patterns of importance for forest landbirds of

   dominate both ecoregions and refuges, but refuge forest patches are
   generally larger and more aggregated than in associated ecoregions.
   Broadleaf taxa have increased in dominance in the ecoregions and
   displaced fire-dependent taxa such as pine (Pinus spp.) and other
   coniferous species; these changes in forest composition have likely also

Abstract = {{1. A key element of conservation planning is the extremely challenging
   task of estimating the likely effect of restoration actions on
   population status. To compare the relative benefits of typical habitat
   restoration actions on Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), we modelled
   the response of an endangered Columbia River Chinook salmon (O.
   tshawytscha) population to changes in habitat characteristics either
   targeted for restoration or with the potential to be degraded.
   2. We applied a spatially explicit, multiple life stage, Beverton-Holt
   model to evaluate how a set of habitat variables with an empirical
   influence on spring-run Chinook salmon survivorship influenced fish
   population abundance, productivity, spatial structure and diversity.
   Using habitat condition scenarios - historical conditions and future
   conditions with restoration, no restoration, and degradation - we asked
   the following questions: (i) how is population status affected by
   alternative scenarios of habitat change, (ii) which individual habitat
   characteristics have the potential to substantially influence population
   status and (iii) which life stages have the largest impact on population
   status?
   3. The difference in population abundance and productivities resulting
   from changes in modelled habitat variables from the `historical' to
   `current' scenarios suggests that there is substantial potential for
   improving population status. Planned restoration actions directed toward
   modelled variables, however, produced only modest improvements.
   4. The model predicted that population status could be improved by
   additional restoration efforts directed toward further reductions in the
   percentage of fine sediments in the streambed, a factor that has a large
   influence on egg survival. Actions reducing fines were predicted to be
   especially effective outside the national forest that covers most of the
   basin. Scenarios that increased capacity by opening access to habitat in
   good condition also had a positive but smaller effect on spawner
   numbers.
   5. Degradation in habitat quality, particularly in percent fine
   sediments, within stream reaches located in the national forest had
   great potential to further reduce this population's viability. This
   finding supports current forest planning efforts to minimise road
   density and clear-cut harvests and to return forest stand structure in
   dry regions to the historical condition that promoted frequent
   low-intensity fires rather than catastrophic stand-replacing fires, as
   these landscape factors have been shown to influence percent fine
   sediment in streams.
   6. Together, these results suggest that planning focusing on protecting
   currently good habitat, reducing fine sediments to promote egg survival
   and increasing spawner capacity will be beneficial to endangered
   spring-run Chinook population status.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern Indonesia has a semi-arid climate with large areas of savanna
   vegetation, and consequently the region is fire-prone. The land is used
   mainly for low-yielding subsistence agriculture and the region faces
   major problems of land degradation and forest degeneration. Fire is a
   fundamental component of traditional and current land management.
   Prescribed fire is used in slash and burn cultivation, for land
   clearing, weed control and to increase nutrient status. Fire is also
   used to promote new grass growth for cattle grazing and to provide some
   protection from wildfire. Some fire regimes have undesirable effects.
   Some fire and grazing regimes encourage the invasion of grazing lands by
   shrubs, threaten lives, property and forestry reserves, and contribute
   to regional atmospheric pollution. Fire has impacts on soil and water
   conservation, which all affect the long-term productivity of the land.
   Although the extent, severity and impacts of fire appear to be
   increasing, these changes are poorly documented. There is little
   understanding of the processes affecting fire behaviour in eastern
   Indonesia and the steps necessary to better manage fire.
   Current and past work by non-government organisations and international
   funding agencies in eastern Indonesia verify the importance of
   integrating fire management with animal husbandry and other farming
   practices when recommending modifications to land management practices.
   An understanding of the cultural and economic restrictions within
   Indonesian communities is essential for the successful adoption of
   recommendations for change.
   The objectives of the workshop were to:
   review fire management in eastern Indonesia and northern Australia
   develop closer regional and institutional links between researchers and
   land managers in northern Australia and eastern Indonesia
   The workshop included position papers, describing the state of knowledge
   in a range of fire management issues, followed by discussion sessions.
   Workshop tasks were to:
   identify and describe the key fire management issues for eastern
   Indonesia and northern Australia;
   summarise recommendations and resolutions generated by the discussion
   sessions;
   discuss methodology appropriate for adoption of recommendations and for
   research and training programs in eastern Indonesia and northern
   Australia;
   publish the proceedings of the workshop in the ACIAR Proceedings series.}},

Title = {{Multi-scale responses of fox squirrels to land-use changes in Florida:
   Utilization mimics historic pine savannas}},

Abstract = {{Pine savanna ecosystems in the southeastern United States are highly
   fragmented and degraded. Within these ecosystems, southeastern fox
   squirrels (Sciurus niger spp.) appear to be excellent bioindicators and
   serve important ecological roles. However, because of the loss of these
   areas, fox squirrel populations are patchily distributed and they are
   thought to be declining. To determine factors influencing their
   distribution, we conducted a multi-scale occupancy study throughout the
   range of the Sherman's fox squirrel (S. n. shermani) in Florida. We
   surveyed 40 landscapes comprised of 200 grids and 1800 camera-trap
   points. We recorded 3170 camera-trap photos of fox squirrels at 8 of the
   21 land cover classes surveyed, at 26 landscapes (65.0\%), 70 grids
   (35.0\%), and 210 of the camera-trap points (11.7\%). At the landscape
   scale (7.65 km(2)), the occurrence of fox squirrels increased as the
   amount of interspersion in tree cover increased, but decreased with
   increasing tree cover, supporting the need for open canopied areas
   interspersed with hardwoods and hardwood thickets at broad scales. At
   the finer grid scale (5.3 ha), their occurrence increased with pine and
   oak densities and proximity to urban and residential development and was
   also negatively influenced by tree cover. At the grid and point scales,
   fox squirrels were more likely to occur in areas with increased canopy
   closure, supporting their association with patches of oak trees imbedded
   in open canopy forests similar to the pine savannas that once dominated
   the region. Fox squirrels' occurrence was negatively influenced by woody
   understory and woody ground cover at all scales. Their preference for a
   midstory with an open canopy and clear understory also suggest a
   reliance on frequent disturbance such as fire to maintain their habitat.
   Fox squirrels appear to be highly adaptable as they occurred in land
   cover types and altered landscapes (e.g., developed, agriculture)
   outside of natural pine savannas. But, as indicators of pine savanna
   ecosystem health, their conservation along with other wildlife tied to
   these forests will necessitate management practices that include or
   emulate a fire regime to reduce tree canopy densities and the
   encroachment of the understory layer and woody ground cover, but also to
   maintain heterogeneity that intersperses requisites (food, shelter, and
   cover) across the landscape. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Response of nesting ducks to habitat and management on the Monte Vista
   National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{1996}},
Number = {{131}},
Pages = {{5-44}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We analyzed duck nesting data from the Monte Vista National Wildlife
   Refuge (MVNWR) in the San Luis Valley (SLV) of Colorado to evaluate the
   influence of habitat and management on nest density and success. From
   1964 to 1990 (except 1977), 4,154 duck nests were found on 16,159 km
   (10,041 miles) of transect. Strip transects were searched twice
   annually, with a follow-up visit to nest sites to determine nest fate.
   During 1964-68, 521 km (324 miles) of transect were searched (142
   transects) twice each year, but this was reduced by half during 1969-90
   (71 transects). We evaluated information on duck nests in 22 of 24
   refuge management units. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) composed 54.5\%
   of the duck nests on MVNWR, followed in abundance by teal species (A.
   cyanoptera, A, discors, A. crecca) and northern pintails (A, acuta).
   Refuge nest densities ranged from a low of 36 nests/km(2) (93
   nests/mi(2)) in 1979 to a high of 161 nests/km(2) (418 nests/mi(2)) in
   1973. Over the 26-year period (1964-90), 52.4\% of 4,154 nests were
   successful. Apparent annual nest success averaged 49.4\% and ranged from
   27\% in 1978 to 72\% in 1966. Nest failure resulted from predation
   (25.8\% of total nests), desertion (10.6\%), flooding (4.9\%),
   or-unknown causes (10.8\%). It was not possible to directly estimate
   true nest success, but indirect methods suggest that true nest success
   was 60 to 90\% that of apparent nest success. Nest success rates were
   similar among species.
   Baltic rush (Juncus balticus) was the most common vegetation on the
   refuge, followed in abundance by black greasewood (Sarcobatus
   vermiculatus), inland saltgrass (Distichlis stricta), and other grass
   species. Stands of common cattail (Typha latifolia), miscellaneous
   herbaceous vegetation, and Baltic rush were preferred nesting cover,
   whereas greasewood and saltgrass generally were avoided.
   Nest density declined (P = 0.037) with increasing grazing intensity,
   with large (38\%) declines apparent the first season after only light
   grazing (0.2 animal unit month/ha {[}0.5 AUM/acre]). Three years after
   grazing, nest density was still depressed at least 17\% below estimated
   pregrazing levels. In addition, nest success declined as grazing
   intensity increased (P = 0.070).
   Duck nesting densities on the MVNWR are among the highest reported in
   North America. High duck production can be maintained by applying water
   in late March; reducing the frequency of grazing and burning treatments;
   and developing wetland management units to achieve their potential.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Invasive alien species are a major problem for managers of protected
   areas (PAs) worldwide. Until the 1980s biological invasions were widely
   considered to be largely confined to anthropogenically disturbed sites
   and the widespread disruption of ecosystems in PAs by invasive species
   was not globally perceived as a major threat. A working group of the
   SCOPE program on biological invasions in the 1980s showed that PAs are
   not spared from major disruptive effects of invasions. Early research
   focused on descriptive studies of the extent to which PAs were invaded.
   More recent research explored drivers of invasion, and in the last
   decade much work has focused on understanding the impacts of invasions.
   We review the current understanding of alien plant invasions in PAs,
   focusing on four themes: (1) the status and macroecological patterns of
   alien plant invasions; (2) the threats that invasive alien plants (IAPs)
   pose and the impacts detected to date; (3) the current focus of invasion
   science in PAs; and (4) research priorities for advancing science-based
   management and policy. Of a sample of 59 widespread IAP species from a
   representative sample of 135 PAs globally, trees make up the largest
   proportion (32\%), followed by perennial herbs (17\%) and shrubs (15\%).
   About 1857 papers have been published on alien species in PAs; 45\% have
   focused on alien plants. Some textbook examples of impacts by IAPs
   originate from PAs, illustrating the severe threat to the core function
   of PAs. Impacts have been quantified at the species and community levels
   through the displacement and alteration of habitats. In some cases,
   native species abundance, diversity and estimated species richness have
   been altered, but reversed following control. At an ecosystem level,
   invasive plants have radically altered fire regimes in several PAs, in
   some cases causing regime shifts and transforming woodlands or savannas
   to grasslands. Invasions have also had a major impact on nutrient
   cycles. Protected areas are performing an increasingly important part of
   the global response to stem the rate of environmental change. Despite
   this, integrated efforts involving science, management and policy that
   are sufficiently resourced to generate insights on the status and
   dynamics of IAPs in PAs are insufficient or even lacking. Such efforts
   are needed to pave the way for monitoring trends, revising legislation
   and policies, and improving management interventions to reduce the
   extent and magnitude of impacts of invasive plants in PAs. While policy
   instruments to support management of non-native species date back to the
   1930s, there has been a substantial increase in legislative support and
   general awareness since the early 2000s. Still, opportunities to improve
   research for PAs need to be created. Towards this goal, the
   establishment of a global PA research network could provide a unique
   vehicle to explore questions across species or functional groups and
   systems, at a scale currently beyond existing abilities. Developing an
   integrated global database with standardized, quantitative information
   could form part of such a networks function.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The environment and habitat are the important aspects of the
   forest ecosystem. The continuous changes in the environment due to
   natural phenomenon or human actions have degraded the forest and
   wildlife habitat thus causing a decline in their population. Therefore
   it is important to study wildlife habitat in order to ensure their
   survival. In this regard, application of Remote Sensing and Geographic
   Information System has been widely accepted as a tool which has immense
   significance in wildlife habitat suitability modeling and mapping. Maps
   derived from analysis of remote sensing data and modeling in GIS are
   highly useful in making the strategies in wildlife management and
   conservation planning. Objectives: The objectives of the study are to
   identify the suitable habitat for wild life and conservation hotspot
   grids were delineated which require immediate attention.
   Methods/Statistical analysis: The wildlife habitat suitability parameter
   based on forest cover, agriculture with settlement, forest fires, roads,
   streams and mines were analyzed. The statistical method such as pairwise
   comparison was used to evaluate the weightage of each parameter which
   helped to determine the wildlife habitat suitability modeling and
   mapping. Findings: The study of wildlife habitat suitability mapping in
   Saranda forest division reveals 42\% of the grid equal to 1898 has very
   high suitability for wild life. The conservation hotspot reserve grid
   based on contiguous patch was identified within the very high wildlife
   suitability habitat was found to be 925 (49\%).
   Application/Improvements: Conservation effort can be focused based on
   the above study and will assist in policy related decision making.}},

Abstract = {{In Serengeti fire is used as a management tool to improve the forage
   quality for large herbivores. However, little is known of the effects of
   fire on grazing resources particularly sward structure, its influence on
   herbivore forage patch selection and utilization to the relative amount
   of phytomass consumed in burnt and nonburnt patches. From September 2003
   to July 2004, consumption of phytomass by large herbivores was assessed
   with eight samplings in six grassland sites in the Western Corridor in
   Serengeti National Park. Each site had burnt and nonburnt plots. Movable
   cages were used to exclude grazing between samplings and plant material
   harvests were used to assess phytomass and sward structure changes in
   time. Nonburnt grasslands had consistently larger phytomass at all
   sampling events whereas the ratio for live leaf/total phytomass was
   higher in burnt grassland at early postfire stages, but declined later
   in the season. Moreover, periodic consumption of both total phytomass
   and different phytomass components shifted between burnt and nonburnt
   grasslands, but there were also large site-specific responses. The shift
   appears to be related to the balance between the amount of phytomass
   available and the quality of the forage in terms of the ratio between
   live and total phytomass. The study highlights the significance of
   maintaining mosaics of burnt and nonburnt areas with an adequate
   provision of forage amount and quality all year round.}},

Abstract = {{In Canada and the United States pressure to recoup financial costs of
   wildfire by harvesting burned timber is increasing, despite insufficient
   understanding of the ecological consequences of postfire salvage
   logging. We compared the species richness and composition of
   deadwood-associated beetle assemblages among undisturbed, recently
   burned, logged, and salvage-logged, boreal, mixed-wood stands. Species
   richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative
   effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species.
   In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and
   logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species
   composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species
   composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in
   quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We
   found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated
   beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage
   logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either
   disturbance alone. Thus, increases in salvage logging of burned forests
   may have serious negative consequences for deadwood-associated beetles

Abstract = {{Cause for spatial variation in phenotypic quality of white-tailed deer
   (Odoccileus virginianus) populations is of great interest to wildlife
   managers. Relating phenotypic variation of populations to large-scale
   land-use patterns may provide insight into why populations exhibit
   spatial variation and elucidate how management can influence population
   phenotype. We used an information-theoretic approach to relate average
   antler size of 203 deer populations to composition and structure of the
   habitat occupied by those populations. We used interspersion, edge, and
   diversity indices to represent habitat structure and percentage of area
   in vegetation types to represent habitat composition. Landscape
   composition was a better predictor of deer population antler size than
   was landscape structure. Percentages of the management unit in
   agriculture, pasture, and pine forest were variables commonly found in
   the region-specific set of best models. Model-averaged estimates of
   agriculture and pasture parameters were always positive and estimates of
   pine forest parameters were always negative, which suggests that
   land-use types that promote growth of early successional herbaceous
   plants will positively influence antler size and, most likely, body
   growth and reproduction of white-tailed deer populations. Conversely,
   our findings suggest landscapes dominated by pine forests did not
   provide optimal amounts of quality forages for white-tailed deer. Pine
   forest effects should be mitigated using a combination of increased
   harvest to lower deer density and silvicultural practices like thinning,
   prescribed burning, and selective herbicide applications that stimulate
   growth of high-quality forages beneath the forest canopy to improve deer
   phenotypic quality.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Fauna translocations arc a tool for improving the conservation
   status of threatened species. Reviews of translocations undertaken in
   Australia and globally have reported that many fail because of predation
   by exotic predators. The outcome of similar to 40\% of translocations
   was unknown, often owing to inadequate post-release monitoring.
   Monitoring methods such as global positioning system data-loggers can
   provide valuable information on survival, habitat use and sociality, and
   can be particularly useful for cryptic species.
   Aims. The present study used global positioning system (GPS)
   data-loggers and VHF radio-transmitters to evaluate the success of a
   reintroduction of the tammar wallaby and measured survival, short-term
   home-range, habitat use and proximity between reintroduced individuals
   (as a proxy for association).
   Methods. Sixty-nine tammar wallabies of captive and wild stock were
   reintroduced to Kalbarri National Park (KNP) following long-term and
   broad-scale fox control, with nine receiving GPS data-loggers, and 16
   receiving VHF radio-transmitters. Wallabies were intensively monitored
   for up to 11 months post-release. Mortalities were investigated using
   DNA identification and field necropsies.
   Key results. In total, 16 of the 25 collared wallabies died within
   11-319 days of release. Ten of the sixteen deaths were from predation.
   Home-range areas were larger than those reported elsewhere. Wallabies
   utilised long-undisturbed vegetation with a dense canopy cover during
   crepuscular periods. These areas were likely sought as refuge from
   predation and thermal extremes. During the main feeding period, a mosaic
   of recently burnt (i.e. similar to 1 year) and >10 years since last
   disturbance was important.
   Conclusions. The reintroduction was not considered successful because
   two-thirds of the collared wallabies died within 1 year of release and,
   therefore, the success criteria were not met.}},

Abstract = {{The 3 spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) subspecies in North America
   (i.e., northern spotted owl {[}S. o. caurina], California spotted owl
   {[}S. o. occidentalis], Mexican spotted owl {[}S. o. lucida]) have all
   experienced population declines over the past century due to habitat
   loss and fragmentation from logging. Now, the emerging influences of
   climate change, high-severity fire, and barred owl (Strix varia)
   invasion also appear to be synergistically and differentially affecting
   population trends of each subspecies. Our objective was to review the
   existing literature on the spotted owl to describe historical and
   emerging threats and whether those threats have been adequately examined
   for each subspecies. Using 527 publications from a Web of Science search
   of the literature from 1900-2015, we statistically evaluated the
   emphasis placed on each subspecies regarding 4 influences: mechanical
   tree removal, fire, climate change, and barred owl invasion. There were
   98 papers that explicitly examined the effects of 1 of these influences.
   Most of these papers were focused on the northern spotted owl, and for
   all 3 subspecies, most papers examined short-term effects only. We used
   our results to identify significant information gaps relative to
   historical and emerging threats. Commercial timber harvesting remains a
   potential threat for all 3 spotted owl subspecies, but effects from
   forest thinning may be increasing because of the heightened emphasis on
   fuels reduction and forest restoration treatments on public lands. Owl
   response to mechanical tree removal, especially forest thinning, remains
   understudied. Climate change also may threaten all 3 subspecies. Changes
   in climate likely affect survival and reproduction of spotted owls and
   their prey, and alter habitat availability by affecting disturbance
   regimes and vegetation composition and succession, but little empirical
   information is available describing specific responses to climate
   change. The literature on response to high-severity fire is sparse for
   some subspecies, primarily short-term in nature, and not consistent.
   Barred owl invasion is a major threat to the northern spotted owl and
   the California spotted owl but does not currently threaten the Mexican
   spotted owl. Rigorous research on the response of spotted owls to all
   factors influencing population change, particularly for the Mexican
   spotted owl, is needed. The most useful information for predicting owl
   response to these threats stems primarily from long-term studies of owl
   demography. The lack of such studies within the range of the Mexican
   spotted owl greatly limits our understanding of its population dynamics
   and our ability to predict the effects of various threats on Mexican
   spotted owl populations. For all 3 subspecies, we encourage long-term
   studies of their responses to threats, using uniquely marked owls across
   large spatial extents to account for spatiotemporal variability in
   ecological conditions within and among subspecies. (C) 2018 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Intensive forest management leads to forest homogeneity and compromises
   biodiversity conservation for the sake of a single commodity provision:
   wood biomass. However, forest biodiversity supports multiple ecosystem
   functions, with the regulation of insect pest populations among the less
   understood. We studied how parasitoid functional diversity and
   composition were affected by forest management and the application of
   harvesting practices directed to the promotion of biodiversity through
   the emulation of natural disturbances, i.e. prescribed burning and
   retention forestry. We used a large-scale, replicated ecological
   experiment initiated in Finland in 2000, where forest structure was
   manipulated with several harvesting regimes in combination with
   prescribed fire. We sampled parasitoid flies (Diptera: Tachinidae)
   attacking herbivorous insects, and compared their functional diversity
   and trait composition between distinct habitats shaped by management and
   in association with plant functional composition. At the local scale,
   parasitoid taxonomic and functional diversity were positively related to
   plant functional diversity. Variation in parasitoid functional
   composition was linked to the different habitats created by forest

   retention and the preservation of old-growth forest, increases habitat
   diversity in boreal forests. This management leads to higher forest
   heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales, increasing plant structural
   diversity and cascading up to higher trophic levels, resulting in higher
   parasitoid functional diversity. This result gives further support for
   the importance of preserving natural early successional and old-growth
   boreal forests, with potential benefits of improved natural biological

Abstract = {{After a successional forest is severely disturbed by wildfire and
   subsequent salvage logging or by clearfell timber harvesting and slash
   burning, if conditions are suitable, the forest will regenerate. It then
   passes through a series of stages of varying floristic composition and
   structure until further severe disturbance occurs. The characteristics
   of a forest-bird assemblage vary with both the successional stage of the
   forest (time period since the most recent severe disturbance event) and
   the long-term disturbance history of the forest. To determine how the
   bird assemblage changes during succession in a south-eastern Australian
   forest type that is fire-sensitive and also subject to regular timber
   harvesting, we surveyed birds in five age-classes of wet forest (from 2
   to >100 years post-disturbance). Bird-assemblage composition altered
   sequentially; the pattern and rate of change reflected those of the
   vegetation. Bird abundance and species richness varied little during
   succession. No species of bird was abundant only in early successional
   forest. Some species, such as Brown Thornbill (Acanthiza pusilla),
   Golden Whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis) and Grey Fantail (Rhipidura
   albiscapa), were common in all successional stages. Other species, such
   as White-throated Treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaea) and Striated
   Pardalote (Pardalotus striatus), were consistently abundant in mid-to
   late successional stages only; this highlighted the importance of older
   forests for avian biodiversity. Any increase in the frequency of severe
   disturbance in these forests would tend to favour only those bird
   species that are already common. This has implications for management
   programs in forests that are habitat for wildlife, but are also used by
   humans for timber harvesting and other commercial or recreational
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Classic ecological concepts and forestry language regarding old growth
   are not well suited to frequent-fire landscapes. In frequent-fire,
   old-growth landscapes, there is a symbiotic relationship between the
   trees, the understory graminoids, and fire that results in a healthy
   ecosystem. Patches of old growth interspersed with younger growth and
   open, grassy areas provide a wide variety of habitats for animals, and
   have a higher level of biodiversity. Fire suppression is detrimental to
   these forests, and eventually destroys all old growth. The
   reintroduction of fire into degraded frequent-fire, old-growth forests,
   accompanied by appropriate thinning, can restore a balance to these
   ecosystems. Several areas require further research and study: 1) the
   ability of the understory to respond to restoration treatments, 2) the
   rate of ecosystem recovery following wildfires whose level of severity
   is beyond the historic or natural range of variation, 3) the effects of
   climate change, and 4) the role of the microbial community. In addition,
   it is important to recognize that much of our knowledge about these

Abstract = {{Timber harvests that aim to promote oak (Quercus) regeneration may have
   indirect impacts on seedling recruitment by altering trophic
   interactions between oak and animals. For example, changes in habitat
   structure following harvest may alter the conditionally mutualistic
   relationship between oak and small mammal granivores like the gray
   squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and
   white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) that act both as acorn
   predators and as dispersers. Over 4 years (2010-2013), we tracked the
   fate of a total of 8000 tagged acorns placed beneath black (Quercus
   velutina) and white oaks (Quercus alba) at 5 control (unharvested) sites
   and 5 sites where the midstory was removed as part of a three-phase
   shelterwood harvest in an oak-dominated forest in southern Indiana, USA.
   We found that acorns in harvested sites were more likely to be taken by
   granivores and were less likely to survive the winter, resulting in an
   overall 67\% reduction in seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE). Harvested
   sites had more vegetative cover and coarse woody debris in the
   understory, providing increased cover from aerial predators and
   potentially facilitating greater acorn removal and a higher probability
   of cache recovery. Reduced seed dispersal effectiveness following
   midstory removal has potential to slow accumulation of oak regeneration
   prior to overstory removal and therefore to reduce the effectiveness of
   shelterwood treatments in promoting future oak dominance in harvested
   stands. Augmentation of shelterwoods with prescribed fire or other
   treatments to reduce understory density may counter this effect. (C)

Abstract = {{Restoration is a critical component of grassland conservation worldwide,
   but grassland management requires disturbances that maintain the
   habitat. Further, successful restorations need to support not just a
   vegetative community, but also a diverse community of other organisms
   that contribute to a range of ecosystem functions. Large herbivore
   grazers like American bison (Bison bison) can be an important part of
   these management strategies, but their role in functions like nutrient
   cycling relies in part on dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae and
   Aphodiinae, and Geotrupidae), which provide valuable ecosystem services
   by removing and burying dung. We evaluated dung beetle community
   responses and dung decomposition in restored and remnant prairies
   shortly (1.5 y) after bison reintroduction. Dung beetle abundance was
   significantly greater where bison were present, where prescribed fire
   had been applied in the past year, and in older restorations and
   remnants. These same environmental characteristics also shifted the
   composition of beetle communities, but not total community biomass, as
   the increased abundance was driven by small-bodied species. Dung
   decomposition varied with bison presence and site age, with the highest
   rates of decomposition in an old restoration with bison present. These
   results indicate that dung beetle communities are capable of rapidly

Abstract = {{Climate change has already begun to impact the structure and function of
   forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest by altering the frequency,
   intensity, and duration of droughts and heat stress, with implications
   for widespread environmental and socio-economic change. A major
   realization is that accumulated physiological stress can ultimately lead
   to tree mortality and changes in species distributions, particularly in
   areas away from maritime influences. To ameliorate the effects of
   drought, insect outbreaks, and reduce the risk of crown fires, various
   strategies are being tested. To make some of these strategies
   economical, biomass is proposed as an alternative energy source. At the
   same time that an increase in harvesting is being considered, there is a
   desire to increase carbon sequestration by forests to offset, at least
   in part, greenhouse gas emissions. Assessments are needed to determine
   current and future impacts of climate change, and to evaluate management
   options while considering carbon storage benefits and sustainability of
   ecosystem structure and function. Here we provide an overview of
   research results from the Pacific Northwest region where forests
   dominate the landscape and contain among the highest biomass on earth.
   In this review, we present findings that challenge common assumptions,
   and suggest a way to predict outcomes of changes in climate and land
   management in the future. The approach includes the use of
   observation-driven land system models that integrate the extent that
   forests are vulnerable to climate change, management practices, and
   economic considerations. It also requires increased emphasis on in situ
   and remotely sensed observations and experiments to initialize and test
   the model, and to track trends in forest condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   diversity in highly fragmented landscapes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The grasslands of central North America have experienced drastic
   reductions in extent, removal of historic disturbance patterns, and
   homogenization of remaining fragments. This has resulted in steep
   declines for a broad swath of grassland biodiversity. Recent work in
   relatively extensive grasslands has demonstrated that mimicking historic
   disturbance patterns using a fire-grazing interaction can increase the
   abundance and diversity of grassland birds through increased habitat
   heterogeneity. We examined the efficacy of this management strategy for
   promoting avian diversity in highly fragmented landscapes, which
   represent the bulk of remaining grassland bird habitats in the tallgrass
   prairie region. We quantified the population density of obligate and
   facultative grassland bird species along transects in 13 experimental
   research pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri
   (USA), divided among three treatments: 1) spatially discrete fires and
   free access by cattle ({''}patch-burn grazed''), 2) free access by
   cattle and a single complete burn ({''}grazed-and-burned''), and 3) a
   single complete burn with no cattle ({''}burned-only''). We expected
   that patch-burn grazing would produce a bird community that overlapped
   that of the grazed-and-burned and burned-only treatments, because it
   would provide habitat for species associated with both. However, an
   analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that community structure on
   pastures managed using patch-burn grazing instead diverged significantly
   from both of the other treatments. Differences in community structure
   were most highly correlated with visual obstruction and wooded edge
   density in the landscape, suggesting bird communities are differentiated
   not only by their structural habitat requirements, but also by the
   varying degrees of sensitivity to landscape fragmentation of their
   component species. The future success of this management scheme for
   fragmented grasslands hinges on if, after an optimal stocking rate is
   identified, adequate habitat can be maintained for a diverse bird
   community, or whether fragmentation will perpetually limit the efficacy
   of this method in these landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the results of landscape analysis of the occurrence of a
   suite of species of arboreal marsupials in the montane ash forests of
   the central highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The species
   targeted for study were: Yellow-bellied Glider (Petaurus australis),
   Mountain Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus caninus), Greater Glider
   (Petauroides volans) and Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus
   leadbeateri). Our analyses involved exploring statistical relationships
   between the presence/absence of these four species and compositional
   variables used to characterise the landscape within 20 and 80 ha circles
   surrounding each of 166, 3 ha, sites surveyed for arboreal marsupials.
   Many potential statistical models were examined for each of the four
   species targeted for analysis. With the exception of P. australis, the
   final model chosen was the null model, i.e. none of the landscape
   variables were statistically significant as predictors of the presence
   of animals at a site. In the case of P. australis, three measures of the
   landscape within the 80 ha circles surrounding our survey sites were
   found to be statistically significant: (1) the presence of old forest,
   (2) the steepness of the forest terrain, and, (3) the area of forest on
   different aspects. There was a significantly higher probability of
   detecting the species on northerly and westerly aspects, on either steep
   or flat terrain, and within circles supporting old growth montane ash
   forest. P. australis has a home range of 40-60 ha which is at least an
   order of magnitude larger than the other species of arboreal marsupials
   examined. Thus, the size of the 80 ha circle used to capture data on
   landscape composition matched the home range size of P. australis more
   closely than other species of arboreal marsupials examined in this
   study. This may, in part, explain why it was the only species for which
   landscape composition variables were found to be significant predictors
   of occurrence. Our findings tentatively suggest that changes in the
   spatial coverage of old growth forest that have resulted from past
   wildfires, post-fire salvage logging and more recent intensive and
   extensive clearfell logging operations, have created landscape patterns
   unsuitable for P. australis. The implications of our results for the
   conservation of the species are discussed. In addition, some
   difficulties were experienced in the use of landscape-scale data in our
   statistical analyses, such as identifying attributes of landscape
   composition that are biologically relevant to the taxa targeted for
   analysis. We briefly discuss the nature of these problems. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Invasion of grasslands by woody plants following the introduction of
   domestic stock is a worldwide phenomenon. Burning is frequently
   recommended as a remedial measure but for a pastoral enterprise it is
   costly and the frequency of the fires required is of critical economic
   importance. The size and longevity of the soil seed-bank is an essential
   part of the response of shrub populations to prescribed fire regimes. In
   this study the seed-bank of the semi-arid zone shrub Dodonaea attenuata
   in Eragrostis eriopoda tussock grassland was examined in relation to
   harvesting by ants and the burning history of the sites. On unburnt
   sites, more than 3500 seeds per m(2) entered the seed-bank in the summer
   1984-85 but sites burnt 5 years previously produced less than one-third
   of that number. Burnt shrubs did not flower for 5 years and no seeds
   survived in the soil through to 1985. Burning immediately prior to seed
   ripening destroyed the seed crop but burning after seed-fall stimulated
   a greater germination in the following spring than on unburnt
   treatments. Ants rapidly harvested most of the seeds produced and after
   20 months the combined effects of ant harvesting and germination had
   reduced the seed-bank at unburnt sites to 8-21 seeds per m(2) and at
   sites burnt 7 years previously to less than two seeds per m(2). Seeds
   were initially harvested in summer by Pheidole spp. of ants for their
   elaiosome and then discarded in middens outside the entrance to the ant
   nest. During the subsequent cool season the seeds were taken back into
   the nest and stored at depths ranging from 2 to 30 cm. It was concluded
   that ants provided short-range dispersal (<10 m) and promoted the
   contagious distribution of D. attenuata, which is advantageous for a
   fire-susceptible, arid-zone shrub invading a grassland liable to be
   burnt: seedlings derived from seeds in ant storage chambers near the
   soil surface and in sparse grass situations caused by competition from
   shrubs may obtain some survival advantage. Prescribed fire has potential
   as a management tool for controlling population density of D. attenuata
   because, depending upon season and frequency, it reduces seed rain by
   killing shrubs, suppresses flowering activity and destroys seed crops on
   the plant. Under the influence of a regime of regular burning, such as
   prevailed prior to the European pastoral industry, the limited soil
   seed-bank would have been a major constraint on D. attenuata
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) occur in open-canopy pine habitat
   on well-drained soils in the southeastern United States, where they
   construct burrows that offer protection from thermal extremes, fire, and
   predators. Gopher tortoise populations have declined over the past 50 y,
   primarily as a result of habitat loss and degradation. Southeastern pine
   forests require active management with prescribed fire, mechanical
   thinning, or removal of hardwoods to maintain suitable habitat for
   gopher tortoises. In addition, many pine forests in the Southeast that
   support gopher tortoise populations are managed for multiple uses
   including intensive silviculture. Heavy equipment associated with these
   activities used in proximity to gopher tortoise burrows can cause them
   to collapse, potentially causing harm to tortoises or other imperiled

   encroachment in grasslands remains unclear. We investigated the flower
   and pod damage by herbivorous insects, and the infection rates of a
   parasitic plant on the shrub Caragana microphylla, which is currently
   encroaching in Inner Mongolia Steppe, under different grazing management
   treatments (33-year non-grazed, 7-year non-grazed, currently grazed).
   Our results showed that Caragana biomass was highest at the currently
   grazed site, and lowest at the 33-year non-grazed site. Herbaceous plant
   biomass followed the opposite pattern, suggesting that grazing is indeed
   facilitating the encroachment of Caragana plants in Inner Mongolia
   Steppe. Grazing also reduced the abundance of herbivorous insects per
   Caragana flower, numbers of flowers and pods damaged by insect
   herbivores, and the infection rates of the parasitic plant on Caragana
   plants. Our results suggest that grazing may facilitate woody
   encroachment in grasslands not only through canonical mechanisms (e.g.
   competitive release via feeding on grasses, reductions in fires, etc.),
   but also by limiting natural biological controls of woody plants
   (herbivorous insects and parasitic plants). Thus, management efforts
   must focus on preventing overgrazing to better protect grassland
   ecosystems from woody encroachment.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying links between micro-habitat selection and wildlife
   reproduction is imperative to population persistence and recovery. This
   information is particularly important for landscape species such as
   greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse). Although
   this species has been widely studied, because environmental factors can
   affect sage-grouse populations, local and regional studies are crucial
   for developing viable conservation strategies. We studied the
   habitat-use patterns of 71 radio-marked sage-grouse inhabiting an area
   affected by wildfire in the Virginia Mountains of northwestern Nevada
   during 2009-2011 to determine the effect of micro-habitat attributes on
   reproductive success. We measured standard vegetation parameters at nest
   and random sites using a multi-scale approach (range=0.01-15,527ha). We
   used an information-theoretic modeling approach to identify
   environmental factors influencing nest-site selection and survival, and
   determine whether nest survival was a function of resource selection.
   Sage-grouse selected micro-sites with greater shrub canopy cover and
   less cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover than random sites. Total shrub
   canopy, including sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and other shrub species, at
   small spatial scales (0.8ha and 3.1ha) was the single contributing
   selection factor to higher nest survival. These results indicate that
   reducing the risk of wildfire to maintain important sagebrush habitats
   could be emphasized in sage-grouse conservation strategies in Nevada.
   Managers may seek to mitigate the influx of annual grass invasion by
   preserving large intact sagebrush-dominated stands with a mixture of
   other shrub species. For this area of Nevada, the results suggest that
   40\% total shrub canopy cover in sage-grouse nesting areas could yield
   improved reproductive success. Published 2015. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {{Isolation by distance (IBD) is a natural pattern not readily
   incorporated into theoretical models nor traditional metrics for
   differentiating populations, although clinal genetic differentiation can
   be characteristic of many wildlife species. Landscape features can also
   drive population structure additive to baseline IBD resulting in
   differentiation through isolation-by-resistance (IBR). We assessed the
   population genetic structure of boreal caribou across western Canada
   using nonspatial (STRUCTURE) and spatial (MEMGENE) clustering methods
   and investigated the relative contribution of IBD and IBR on genetic
   variation of 1,221 boreal caribou multilocus genotypes across western
   Canada. We further introduced a novel approach to compare the
   partitioning of individuals into management units (MU) and assessed
   levels of genetic connectivity under different MU scenarios. STRUCTURE
   delineated five genetic clusters while MEMGENE identified finer-scale
   differentiation across the study area. IBD was significant and did not
   differ for males and females both across and among detected genetic
   clusters. MEMGENE landscape analysis further quantified the proportion
   of genetic variation contributed by IBD and IBR patterns, allowing for
   the relative importance of spatial drivers, including roads, water
   bodies, and wildfires, to be assessed and incorporated into the
   characterization of population structure for the delineation of MUs.
   Local population units, as currently delineated in the boreal caribou
   recovery strategy, do not capture the genetic variation and connectivity
   of the ecotype across the study area. Here, we provide the tools to
   assess fine-scale spatial patterns of genetic variation, partition
   drivers of genetic variation, and evaluate the best management options
   for maintaining genetic connectivity. Our approach is highly relevant to
   vagile wildlife species that are of management and conservation concern
   and demonstrate varying degrees of IBD and IBR with clinal spatial
   genetic structure that challenges the delineation of discrete population
   boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Montane coniferous forests and woodlands in the Front Range of the
   Colorado Rocky Mountains have been subject to increased wildfire in
   recent years. The area and intensity of these fires is strongly
   dependent upon the spatial variability and type of fuels as they are
   arrayed across the landscape. Considering the size of the patches and
   the mosaic of fuel materials, high spectral and spatial resolution
   estimates of vegetation components and fuel types are needed to improve
   fire risk assessment, especially around the wildland/urban interface.
   Here we used highly resolved remotely sensed imagery, in combination
   with several spectral techniques to map major forest components and fuel
   types in montane coniferous forests in the Colorado Front Range by
   discriminating the fractional covers of photosynthetic vegetation (PV),
   non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and bare soil at a sub-pixel level.
   An accuracy assessment based on a dataset including 34 field transects
   indicated that we could explain fractional cover of 73.5\%, 40.3\%, and
   77.6\% for PV, NPV, and soil respectively through the use of
   hyperspectral indicators. Based on the fractional cover of these
   components, we were able to assess the spatial patterns of vegetation
   and fuel characteristics at a landscape scale. Throughout the study
   areas, PV fractions were dominant (48.7\%), followed by NPV (28.8\%) and
   soil (22.5\%). However, due to microclimate and disturbances such as
   fire, insect infestations and forest management practices, the spatial
   distribution of fractions was highly heterogeneous. There was a high
   fraction of PV in mature forest and on north-facing slopes, and a high
   fraction of NPV and bare soil in areas with recent disturbance such as
   fire or insect infestation. In severely burned areas, bare soil was
   dominant. Fuel treatments reduced the fraction of PV by 11.7\%, and
   increased fractions of NPV by 7.4\% and bare soil by 4.5\%. These
   results suggest that hyperspectral remote sensing can be an excellent
   indicator of not only fuel fractional cover, but of fuel condition after
   fire, thereby greatly improving regional fire risk assessment. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Oak savanna systems were once fairly common across the midwestern United

   ecosystems combined with conservation concerns for savanna-associated
   species such as the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly have
   resulted in a growing interest in oak savanna restoration and

   different savanna restoration approaches using an operational-scale
   restoration experiment established in 2008 and 2009 on the
   Huron-Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan. We compared three
   mechanical thinning approaches (bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter)

   results suggest that among mechanical thinning approaches, the shear
   cutter was the most effective for promoting management goals of higher
   herbaceous plant cover, higher wild lupine cover, reduced woody plant
   cover, and lower invasive species cover. Postestablishment prescribed
   burning appears to be effective for furthering these management goals by
   reducing woody plant cover and creating more exposed soil for plant
   colonization. Seeding treatments further promoted desired cover types,
   while minimizing undesired cover types. The results presented here

Title = {{Assessing soil compaction and micro-topography impacts of alternative
   heather cutting as compared to burning as part of grouse moor management
   on blanket bog}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Background. Over 25\% of the UK land area is covered by uplands, the
   bulk of which are comprised of blanket bog. This not only contains most
   of the UK's terrestrial carbon stocks, but also represents 15\% of this
   globally rare habitat. About 30\% of UK blanket bog is managed for red
   grouse by encouraging ling heather (Calluna vulgaris) with rotational
   burning, which has been linked to habitat degradation, with reduced
   carbon storage and negative impacts on water storage and quality.
   Alternative cutting is currently being pursued as a potential
   restoration management. However, the often used heavy cutting machinery
   could cause considerable compaction and damage to the peat surface. Two
   particular issues are (i) a potential increase in bulk density reducing
   water storage capacity (i.e., less pore volume and peat depth), and (ii)
   a possible reduction of the micro-topography due to cutting off the tops
   of hummocks (i.e., protruding clumps or tussocks of sedges).
   Methods. We set up a fully replicated field experiment assessing cutting
   versus burn management impacts on peat physical and surface properties.
   Both managements reflected commonly used grouse moor management practice
   with cutting using heavy tractors fitted with load distributing double
   wheel and tracks (lowering ground pressure), whilst burning was done
   manually (setting heather areas alight with flame torches). We assessed
   management impacts on peat depth, bulk density and peat surface
   micro-topography which either included pre-management measurements or
   plot-level data for uncut plots. Total peat depth and bulk density in
   four 5 cm sections within the top 50 cm was assessed. Micro-topography
   was determined as the standard deviation of the height offsets measured
   over several plot transects in relation to the plot peat surface level
   at the start and end points of each transect.
   Results. Despite an anticipated compaction from the heavy machinery used
   for cutting, the peat showed resilience and there was no lasting
   plot-level impact on either peat depth or bulk density. Notably, bulk
   density showed differences prior to, and thus unrelated to, management,
   and an overall increasing bulk density, even in uncut plots. However,
   cutting did reduce the plot micro-topography by about 2 cm, mostly due
   to removing the tops of hummocks, whereas burnt plots did not differ
   from uncut plots.
   Discussion. Cutting is suggested as a suitable alternative to burning on
   grouse moors, although compaction issues might be site specific,
   depending on the nature of the peat, the machinery used and impacts at
   resting and turning points (which were not assessed). However, any
   observed bulk density differences could reflect natural changes in
   relation to changes in peat moisture, requiring adequate experimental
   comparisons. Moreover, where micro-topography is a priority, cutting
   equipment might need to consider the specific ground conditions, which
   could involve adjusting cutting height and the type of cutting machinery
   used.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many terrestrial ecosystems are fire prone, such that their composition
   and structure are largely due to their fire regime. Regions subject to
   regular fire have exceptionally high levels of species richness and
   endemism, and fire has been proposed as a major driver of their
   diversity, within the context of climate, resource availability and
   environmental heterogeneity. However, current fire-management practices
   rarely take into account the ecological and evolutionary roles of fire
   in maintaining biodiversity. Here, we focus on the mechanisms that
   enable fire to act as a major ecological and evolutionary force that
   promotes and maintains biodiversity over numerous spatiotemporal scales.
   From an ecological perspective, the vegetation, topography and local
   weather conditions during a fire generate a landscape with spatial and
   temporal variation in fire-related patches (pyrodiversity), and these
   produce the biotic and environmental heterogeneity that drives
   biodiversity across local and regional scales. There have been few
   empirical tests of the proposition that `pyrodiversity begets
   biodiversity' but we show that biodiversity should peak at moderately
   high levels of pyrodiversity. Overall species richness is greatest
   immediately after fire and declines monotonically over time, with
   postfire successional pathways dictated by animal habitat preferences
   and varying lifespans among resident plants. Theory and data support the
   `intermediate disturbance hypothesis' when mean patch species diversity
   is correlated with mean fire intervals. Postfire persistence,
   recruitment and immigration allow species with different life histories
   to coexist. From an evolutionary perspective, fire drives population
   turnover and diversification by promoting a wide range of adaptive
   responses to particular fire regimes. Among 39 comparisons, the number
   of species in 26 fire-prone lineages is much higher than that in their
   non-fire-prone sister lineages. Fire and its byproducts may have direct
   mutagenic effects, producing novel genotypes that can lead to trait
   innovation and even speciation. A paradigm shift aimed at restoring
   biodiversity-maintaining fire regimes across broad landscapes is
   required among the fire research and management communities. This will
   require ecologists and other professionals to spread the burgeoning
   fire-science knowledge beyond scientific publications to the broader
   public, politicians and media.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new review of our knowledge of the ancient forest
   beetle fauna from Holocene archaeological and palaeoecological sites in
   Great Britain and Ireland. It examines the colonisation, dispersal and
   decline of beetle species, highlighting the scale and nature of human
   activities in the shaping of the landscape of the British Isles. In
   particular, the paper discusses effects upon the insect fauna, and
   examines in detail the fossil record from the Humberhead Levels, eastern
   England. It discusses the local extirpation of up to 40 species in
   Britain and 15 species in Ireland. An evaluation of the timing of
   extirpations is made, suggesting that many species in Britain disappear
   from the fossil record between ca 3000 and 1000 cal BC (ca 5000-3000 cal
   BP), although some taxa may well have survived until considerably later.
   In Ireland, there are two distinct trends, with a group of species which
   seem to be absent after ca 2000 cal BC (ca 4000 cal BP) and a further
   group which survives until at least as late as the medieval period. The
   final clearance of the Irish landscape over the last few hundred years
   was so dramatic, however, that some species which are not especially
   unusual in a British context were decimated. Reasons behind the
   extirpation of taxa are examined in detail, and include a combination of
   forest clearance and human activities, isolation of populations, lack of
   temporal continuity of habitats, edaphic and competition factors
   affecting distribution of host trees (particularly pine), lack of forest
   fires and a decline in open forest systems. The role of climate change
   in extirpations is also evaluated.
   Consideration is given to the significance of these specialised ancient
   forest inhabitants in Ireland in the absence of an early Holocene
   land-bridge which suggests that colonisation was aided by other
   mechanisms, such as human activities and wood rafting. Finally, the
   paper discusses the Continental origins of the British and Irish fauna
   and its hosts and the role played by European glacial refugia. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{The environmental and socio-economic impacts of wildfires are foreseen

Abstract = {{In many parts of the boreal biome intensive forest management has
   resulted in profound changes in forest structure, tree species
   composition and dead wood availability, and by so negatively effecting
   forest biodiversity. Restoration of degraded forest habitats is
   therefore of high priority, both internationally and nationally.
   Consequently, it is of uttermost importance to develop cost-efficient
   restoration methods. We have therefore initiated a cost neutral
   ecological restoration experiment aimed at increasing the variety and
   volume of dead wood in voluntary set-asides (as part of the FSC
   certification requirements) by mimicking the two natural disturbances,
   forest fire and small scale gap dynamics. We studied how tree species
   and substrate type, i.e. the way in which a tree was killed (cut,
   girdled, tipped over or cut to produce a high stump), affect species
   composition, abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles. We
   found that species composition differed between tree species in burned
   as well as gap-cut stands, and that tree posture, i.e. standing or
   downed trees, also affected species composition in gap-cut stands. In
   addition, abundance and species richness differed between tree species
   in gap-cut stands, generally being higher in spruce than in pine and
   birch. Based on our results we recommend a wider practice of dead wood
   creation involving a multitude of tree species and tree postures,
   through mimicking natural disturbances in the management of boreal
   forests. Furthermore, we suggest that voluntary set-asides provide an
   excellent opportunity for restoration as they are wide spread and
   already available in the forest landscape. Restoration cost can
   therefore be kept at a minimum or totally avoided as in this study.}},

Abstract = {{In this era of climate change, understanding past and predicting future
   fire activity are scientific challenges that are central to the
   development of sustainable forest management practices and policies.
   Such objectives, however, are difficult to achieve for several reasons.
   Uncertainties about future fire activity can be superimposed on the
   short time period covered by existing meteorological data and fire
   statistics, from which a historical range of variability can be
   determined. Regional fire activity is also tremendously variable over
   time, such that contemporary fire records cannot provide information on
   the full range of fire activity variability a given forest experienced
   and adapted to. This factor is increasingly important when it comes to
   determining the resilience of boreal forests to changes in climate and
   disturbance regimes. In this paper, we present a synthesis of past,
   present and future trends in seasonal fire danger and fire activity
   based on data gathered in eastern Canadian boreal forests over the last
   20 years, and we provide a critical assessment of the ability to conduct
   sustainable forest management over the 21st century. The data synthesis
   provides compelling evidence of a synchronous pattern of decreasing
   fire-conducive climatic conditions and activity of large fire seasons
   over the last 2000 years in the eastern coniferous boreal forest. Model
   simulations suggest that the climate will become drier in upcoming
   decades, driving future fire activity close to the upper bound of the
   pre-industrial range of variability. The effects of increasing fire
   incidence cumulated with forest harvesting may thus pose a risk to
   forest resilience in the future. This ecological knowledge should help
   us to define forest management strategies and practices considering
   future fire activity changes forecasted under climate change.
   Development of alternative silvicultural interventions that would
   emulate secondary disturbances (e.g. wind, insects) rather than fire
   would be necessary to maintain pre-industrial forest characteristics
   (e.g. composition and age class distribution), and associated forest
   resilience. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

   November 1995 a low- intensity experimental fire burned the entire home
   range of most animals. The northern bettong appeared fairly catholic in
   choice of nest site, with a variety of nest locations and nesting
   materials used. Prior to the fire, nests were generally located in areas
   of dense cover, such as the skirts of grass trees (46\%) or grass close
   to a log (29\%). After fire removed most ground cover in the nesting
   areas of most animals, bettongs used remaining shelter such as boulder
   piles (45\%), recently fallen trees (8\%) and patches of unburnt
   vegetation (21\%). Nest areas (10.1 ha) of males were significantly
   larger than those of females (5.4 ha). Home ranges of both sexes were
   large (59 ha) and most ranges lacked distinct core areas, suggesting
   that bettongs used all parts of their home ranges equally. High mean
   rates of nightly movement by the northern bettong indicated that large
   distances were moved within home ranges during nightly foraging. No
   significant fire-related changes were detected in home-range size,
   home-range location, nest-area location or mean rates of nightly

Abstract = {{The Endangered Orachrysops ariadne (Butler 1898) (Karkloof blue
   butterfly) is endemic to the Endangered Moist Midlands Grassland in
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and is extant at four sites. The results
   from the monitoring of the eggs laid by O. ariadne in a grassland area
   that is frequently burnt by poor rural people to ensure that palatable
   grass is available to their livestock, suggested the implementation of
   management interventions (fencing and firebreak burning) to prevent the
   local extinction of the butterfly. The number of eggs at the monitoring
   site declined dramatically between 2002 and 2003 and fluctuated after
   the management interventions were initiated properly in 2008, but had
   nearly reached the target number of 250 by 2013. An index count method
   for the monitoring of O. ariadne eggs at the other three known colonies,
   where plant invasion rather than uncontrolled burning is a major threat,
   was developed and shown to be efficient with regard to time relative to
   the number of eggs sampled. The host ant Camponotus natalensis (F. Smith
   1858) (Natal sugar ant) was found to be present in all the host-plant
   patches at one colony site, indicating that all host-plant patches are
   likely to be breeding areas for the butterfly. Invasive plant control at
   and appropriate burning of the habitat of O. ariadne should assist in
   ensuring the survival of these colonies.
   Conservation implications: Adaptive monitoring and management of
   threatened endemic invertebrates and their habitats may be crucial for
   their continued survival. The development of efficient methods for the
   monitoring of such species is required where resources are limited, as
   threats to the species may cause sudden and irreversible declines in
   population size.}},

Abstract = {{Forest restoration often includes thinning to reduce tree density and
   improve ecosystem processes and function while also reducing the risk of
   wildfire or insect and disease outbreaks. However, one drawback of these
   restoration treatments is that slash is often burned in piles that may
   damage the soil and require further restoration activities. Pile burning
   is currently used on many forest sites as the preferred method for
   residue disposal because piles can be burned at various times of the
   year and are usually more controlled than broadcast burns. In many
   cases, fire can be beneficial to site conditions and soil properties,
   but slash piles, with a large concentration of wood, needles, forest
   floor, and sometimes mineral soil, can cause long-term damage. We
   describe several alternative methods for reducing nonmerchantable forest
   residues that will help remove excess woody biomass, minimize
   detrimental soil impacts, and create charcoal for improving soil organic

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Australian small mammals such as koalas must cope with immense pressure
   from anthropogenic induced stressors or trauma such as bushfires,
   vehicle collision impacts and habitat disturbance and land clearance. In
   addition, they must cope with diseases such as chlamydia. To date, there
   is no published literature on physiological stress levels in wild koala
   populations compared with identified environmental stressors. This study
   investigated physiological stress levels within sub-populations of wild
   koalas encountering environmental trauma and disease from New South
   Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA). Physiological
   stress was determined using a faecal glucocorticoid (or cortisol)
   metabolites (FGMs) enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) from 291 fresh faecal
   samples collected from wild koalas at the point of rescue. A healthy
   breeding sub-population from a forest reserve in QLD acted as a control
   group. Clearance of prime Eucalyptus habitat had the largest impact on
   FGMs, followed by bushfire related factors (e.g. flat demeanour,
   dehydration and burns injury). Koalas with other sources of physical
   injury (dog-attacks and vehicle collisions) and disease (chlamydia) also
   had higher FGMs compared to healthy wild koalas. Healthy wild koalas
   expressed the lowest median levels of FGMs. Overall, the results
   highlight that anthropogenic-induced stressors tend to increase
   physiological stress in wild koalas. Thus, the ultimate stressors such
   as habitat clearance and bush fire events could increase the incidences
   of proximate stressors such as dog attacks and vehicle collisions, and
   increase risks of foliage shortage, diseases and mortality. Therefore,
   there is need for ecological monitoring, conservation management actions
   and policy changes to curb the koala population crisis, especially
   within on-going and future land and road development programs.}},

Abstract = {{The severe disruption of herbivore relationships can result in
   catastrophic, demographic consequences for plant populations. We
   investigated the potential roles of herbivory, fire and their
   interaction, in the observed long-term regeneration failure of Persoonia
   elliptica R.Br. (Proteaceae), an understory tree species of fire-prone
   jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Sm.) forests in southwestern Australia.
   Seed production, storage and viability were assessed, as was seedling
   recruitment in both the presence and absence of fire (a potential
   germination cue), using experimental herbivore exclosure plots. We also
   sought to determine the `herbivory zone' (height) within which P.
   elliptica was susceptible to browsing. Herbivores, primarily the western
   grey kangaroo, preferentially consumed leaves of P. elliptica up to a
   browsing height of 1.5 m. Viability of fresh seeds was low at ca. 39 \%
   and rapid viability loss was observed in the soil seed bank, with only
   ca. 5 \% of seeds remaining viable for > 1 year. Germination was
   restricted almost solely to burned areas and survival of recruits to the
   confines of herbivore exclosures. We suggest that an increase in the
   primary herbivore, combined with low viable seed supply, is the likely
   cause of continuing regeneration failure in this species. The slow
   growth of the species suggests that without intervention, seedlings and
   juvenile plants will be unable to escape the herbivory zone. Management
   actions to facilitate recruitment might best focus on the combination of
   managed fires to break seed dormancy, followed by fencing to protect
   seedlings from large herbivores.}},

   against time since fire and rainfall, between 2000 and 2008, to provide
   ecological and biological information relevant to population management.
   At both sites, decreased plant size was inversely correlated with time
   since fire and the number of non-reproductive plants was positively
   correlated with time since fire. Rates of flowering were inversely
   correlated with time since fire at only one site (Population 2). The
   vegetation at this site rapidly accumulated after fire, whereas recovery
   was relatively slow at the other site. Rainfall was not correlated with
   rates of flowering or leaf width at either of the study sites, although

   lead to decreased plant size in the following year. Annual variation in
   rates of flowering may be influenced by previous reproductive effort.

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance regimes are changing worldwide, and the consequences for
   ecosystem function and resilience are largely unknown. Functional
   diversity (FD) provides a surrogate measure of ecosystem function by
   capturing the range, abundance and distribution of trait values in a
   community. Enhanced understanding of the responses of FD to measures of
   vegetation structure at landscape scales is needed to guide conservation
   management. To address this knowledge gap, we used a whole-of-landscape
   sampling approach to examine relationships between bird FD, vegetation
   diversity and time since fire. We surveyed birds and measured vegetation
   at 36 landscape sampling units in dry and wet forest in southeast
   Australia during 2010 and 2011. Four uncorrelated indices of bird FD
   (richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion) were derived from six
   bird traits, and we investigated responses of these indices and species
   richness to both vertical and horizontal vegetation diversity using
   linear mixed models. We also considered the extent to which the mean and
   diversity of time since fire were related to vegetation diversity.
   Results showed opposing responses of FD to vegetation diversity in dry
   and wet forest. In dry forest, where fire is frequent, species richness
   and two FD indices (richness and dispersion) were positively related to
   vertical vegetation diversity, consistent with theory relating to
   environmental variation and coexistence. However, in wet forest subject
   to infrequent fire, the same three response variables were negatively
   associated with vertical diversity. We suggest that competitive
   dominance by species results in lower FD as vegetation diversity
   increases in wet forest. The responses of functional evenness were
   opposite to those of species richness, functional richness and
   dispersion in both forest types, highlighting the value of examining
   multiple FD metrics at management-relevant scales. The mean and
   diversity of time since fire were uncorrelated with vegetation diversity
   in wet forest, but positively correlated with vegetation diversity in
   dry forest. We therefore suggest that protection of older vegetation is
   important, but controlled application of low-severity fire in dry forest
   may sustain ecosystem function by enhancing different elements of FD.}},

   seed production and population growth rates.
   Seed production was reduced by insect herbivores and increased by
   fertilizer addition, but treatment effects were independent. Herbivore
   effects on tall thistle population growth depended upon soil nutrients
   in only one of seven annual transitions. Herbivores reduced thistle
   population growth in two of three annual transitions that included
   prescribed fire, whereas they reduced population growth in only one of
   four transitions without fire. Soil nutrient availability does not
   provide a general explanation for variation in herbivore effects on tall
   thistle population growth rates. Disturbance regime may be a more
   important aspect of ecological context for influencing herbivore effects
   on tall thistle populations in mesic grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires affect biodiversity at multiple levels. While vegetation is
   directly changed by fire events, animals are often indirectly affected
   through changes in habitat and food availability. Globally, fire
   frequency and the extent of fires are predicted to increase in the
   future. The impact of fire on the biodiversity of temperate wetlands has
   gained little attention so far. We compared species richness and
   abundance of plants and birds in burnt and unburnt areas in the Amur
   floodplain/Russian Far East in the year of fire and 1 year after. We
   also analysed vegetation recovery in relation to time since fire over a
   period of 18 years. Plant species richness was higher in burnt compared
   to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after.
   This suggests that fire has a positive short-term effect on plant
   diversity. Bird species richness and abundance were lower on burnt
   compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year
   after. Over a period of 18 years, high fire frequency led to an increase
   in herb cover and a decrease in grass cover. We show that the effects on
   biodiversity are taxon- and species-specific. Fire management strategies
   in temperate wetlands should consider fire frequency as a key driving
   force of vegetation structure, with carry-over effects on higher trophic
   levels. Designing fire refuges, i.e., areas that do not burn annually,
   might locally be necessary to maintain high species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Within the sagebrush steppe ecosystem, sagebrush plants influence a
   number of ecosystem properties, including nutrient distribution, plant
   species diversity, soil moisture, and temperature, and provide habitat
   for a wide variety of wildlife species. Recent increases in frequency
   and size of wildfires and associated annual grass expansion within the
   Wyoming big sagebrush alliance have increased the need for effective
   sagebrush restoration tools and protocols. Our objectives were to
   quantify the success of Wyoming big sagebrush transplants relative to
   transplant stock (nursery seedlings vs. wildlings) across different
   ecological sites and vegetation types and to test the hypothesis that
   reduction of herbaceous vegetation would increase survival of
   transplanted sagebrush. We used a randomized block (reps=5) design at
   each of three sites-1) cheatgrass dominated, 2) native plant dominated,
   and 3) crested wheatgrass dominated-near Elko, Nevada. Treatments
   included plant stock (nursery stock or locally harvested wildlings) and
   herbicide (glyphosate) to reduce competition from herbaceous vegetation.
   Transplants were planted in the spring of 2009 and 2010 and monitored
   for survival. Data were analyzed for site and treatment effects using
   mixed-model ANOVA. Surviving plant density at and 2 yr postplanting was
   generally highest (up to 3-fold) on the native site (P < 0.05). Density
   of surviving transplants was almost 3-fold higher for nursery stock on
   most sites for the 2009 planting, but differences in survival by
   planting stock were minimal for the 2010 planting. Glyphosate
   application increased surviving plant density up to 300\% (depending on
   site) for both years of planting. High labor and plant material
   investments (relative to traditional drilling or broadcasting) may limit
   the size of projects for which sagebrush transplants are practical, but
   these costs may be partially offset by high success relative to
   traditional methods. Our data indicate that sagebrush transplants can be
   effective for establishing sagebrush on depleted sites.}},

Abstract = {{The perception and measurement of the risk of natural disturbances often
   varies depending on the spatial and temporal scales over which
   information is collected or analyzed. This can lead to conflicting
   conclusions about severity of current or past disturbances or the risk
   of future ones. Failure to look across scales also complicates local
   implementation of policies developed from broad-scale perceptions of
   risk because perception of risk is relative and depends on context.
   Methods that help policymakers, managers, and the public look across
   spatial and temporal scales can improve their understanding of the
   long-term dynamics of disturbances like wildfire and insect outbreaks.
   This capability provides a foundation for prioritizing restoration
   management activities, especially in forest types prone to frequent or
   severe disturbances. Although techniques for estimating risk over
   increasingly large spatial scales are becoming more widespread, the
   connection of risk assessments from broad to fine scales is not well
   established. We use a synthesis of five existing analyses to illustrate
   how scale affects the perception and interpretation of risk as

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of rainfall and fire on the population
   dynamics of mammals in desert ecosystems has been hampered by a lack of
   long-term data. In this study, we use a 16-year data set to investigate
   these relationships in an assemblage of 8 small rodents and dasyurid
   marsupials in central Australia. We hypothesized that marsupial
   populations would be less variable and less responsive to rainfall than
   rodents, and would also exhibit lower capture rates. We also
   hypothesized that fire would decrease capture rates of both groups and
   that in the 5 years after fire, rodents would be more abundant on burned
   sites than marsupials. Our data show, however, that population
   fluctuations in rodents and marsupials were largely synchronous, albeit
   of greater absolute size in rodents, and only partly explained by
   antecedent rainfall. While fire initially reduced all mammal
   populations, postburn areas were preferentially exploited by both
   groups, with rodents displaying only a weak pattern of prolonged use of
   burned areas. Since both groups recovered well from drought and
   wildfire, protection of drought refuges and generation of new habitat
   through small prescribed burns may benefit both groups. Although
   dasyurid marsupials have been found previously to show inconsistent
   responses to rainfall and fire, we conclude that their dynamics may

   Fire and Water Limitation?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Invasive species may owe some of their success in competing and
   co-existing with native species to microbial symbioses they are capable
   of forming. Tall fescue is a cool-season, non-native, invasive grass
   capable of co-existing with native warm-season grasses in North American
   grasslands that frequently experience fire, drought, and cold winters,
   conditions to which the native species should be better-adapted than
   tall fescue. We hypothesized that tall fescue's ability to form a
   symbiosis with Neotyphodium coenophialum, an aboveground fungal
   endophyte, may enhance its environmental stress tolerance and
   persistence in these environments. We used a greenhouse experiment to
   examine the effects of endophyte infection (E+ vs. E-), prescribed fire
   (1 burn vs. 2 burn vs. unburned control), and watering regime (dry vs.
   wet) on tall fescue growth. We assessed treatment effects for growth
   rates and the following response variables: total tiller length, number
   of tillers recruited during the experiment, number of reproductive
   tillers, tiller biomass, root biomass, and total biomass. Water regime
   significantly affected all response variables, with less growth and
   lower growth rates observed under the dry water regime compared to the
   wet. The burn treatments significantly affected total tiller length,
   number of reproductive tillers, total tiller biomass, and total biomass,
   but treatment differences were not consistent across parameters.
   Overall, fire seemed to enhance growth. Endophyte status significantly
   affected total tiller length and tiller biomass, but the effect was
   opposite what we predicted (E->E+). The results from our experiment
   indicated that tall fescue was relatively tolerant of fire, even when
   combined with dry conditions, and that the fungal endophyte symbiosis
   was not important in governing this ecological ability. The persistence
   of tall fescue in native grassland ecosystems may be linked to other
   endophyte-conferred abilities not measured here (e.g., herbivory
   release) or may not be related to this plant-microbial symbiosis.}},

Title = {{Southern marl prairies conceptual ecological model}},
Journal = {{WETLANDS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{821-831}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of
   Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically
   drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently,
   peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of
   calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone
   bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet
   prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and
   tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species.
   However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide
   stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry
   season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual
   ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific
   concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal
   drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management
   practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to
   five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and
   connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity,
   extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and
   spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native
   fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant
   species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow
   (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic
   fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and
   wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development
   are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes
   of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats
   have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been
   significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to
   inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species
   diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients
   to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native
   communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity
   dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography
   resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow
   populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended
   hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season
   fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid
   wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic
   fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have
   decreased in density and changed in species composition and size
   structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod,
   increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution
   holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American
   alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator
   holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod
   and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to
   forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have
   been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod.}},

Abstract = {{Under a rapidly warming climate, a critical management issue in semiarid
   forests of western North America is how to increase forest resilience to
   wildfire. We evaluated relationships between fuel reduction treatments
   and burn severity in the 2006 Tripod Complex fires, which burned over
   70000 ha of mixed-conifer forests in the North Cascades range of
   Washington State and involved 387 past harvest and fuel treatment units.
   A secondary objective was to investigate other drivers of burn severity
   including landform, weather, vegetation characteristics, and a recent
   mountain pine beetle outbreak. We used sequential autoregression (SAR)
   to evaluate drivers of burn severity, represented by the relative
   differenced Normalized Burn Ratio index, in two study areas that are
   centered on early progressions of the wildfire complex. Significant
   predictor variables include treatment type, landform (elevation), fire
   weather (minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature), and
   vegetation characteristics, including canopy closure, cover type, and
   mountain pine beetle attack. Recent mountain pine beetle damage was a
   statistically significant predictor variable with red and mixed classes
   of beetle attack associated with higher burn severity. Treatment age and
   size were only weakly correlated with burn severity and may be partly
   explained by the lack of treatments older than 30 years and the low
   rates of fuel succession in these semiarid forests. Even during extreme
   weather, fuel conditions and landform strongly influenced patterns of
   burn severity. Fuel treatments that included recent prescribed burning
   of surface fuels were particularly effective at mitigating burn
   severity. Although surface and canopy fuel treatments are unlikely to
   substantially reduce the area burned in regional fire years, recent
   research, including this study, suggests that they can be an effective
   management strategy for increasing forest landscape resilience to

Abstract = {{Evaluating tradeoffs between the short- and long-term risks of different
   management scenarios in fire prone ecosystems is crucial to
   implementation of the National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest
   Restoration Act (H.R. 1904). We demonstrate a process for conducting
   these relative risk assessments using models and data generally
   available via the public domain. Our risk assessment process integrates
   information about the ecological characteristics of the landscape,
   vegetation dynamics as related to different management scenarios, and
   fire modeling, to generate inputs for effects analyses on water
   temperature, peak flows, landslides, and northern spotted owls (Strix
   occidentalis caurina). The process is demonstrated for current
   management with owl foraging emphasis and no management scenarios in a
   325,000 ha landscape in southwestern Oregon. The current management with
   owl foraging emphasis scenario represents a reasonable portrayal of
   current land management policies and allocations with an emphasis on
   providing spotted owl foraging habitat across the landscape. The no
   management scenario portrays only vegetation dynamics as projected by a
   growth and yield model. Results from both management scenarios were
   subjected to fire and effects modeling. Simulation results indicated
   that risk metrics used in this demonstration were sensitive to the
   manner in which we described and attributed the landscape and our model
   formulations and thus, were useful measures for relative risk
   assessments. Model simulations demonstrated that the potential for
   uncharacteristic fire increased five-fold within the first 20 years
   under both management scenarios. The area burned by crown fire and
   uncharacteristic fire also increased over time for both management
   scenarios. Both management scenarios resulted in a decline of spotted
   owl habitat, with the current management with owl foraging emphasis
   scenario creating more unfavorable conditions. We attribute the
   relatively high long-term risk of the current management with owl
   foraging emphasis scenario to a combination of the large-scale passive
   management approach instituted on a substantial portion of the landscape
   (approximately 55\% of the assessment area), the presence of
   plantation-based forestry (approximately 22\% of the area), and by
   default, the limited opportunity to implement hazardous fuels reduction
   at a scale large enough to influence landscape-level fuel patterns.
   These preliminary results suggest that a spatially explicit, more
   aggressive hazardous fuels reduction management scenario, that may
   conflict with current land management policies and allocations, is
   needed to reduce the continuity of hazardous fuels and sustain healthy
   forest conditions and spotted owl habitat. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All

Abstract = {{1. Prescribed burning is used in tropical savannas to improve habitat
   conditions for domestic and wild herbivores, but its effects on the
   ecological interactions between these herbivore guilds have never been
   assessed experimentally. Understanding such effects will contribute
   towards more informed management of both guilds in landscapes where they
   share habitats.
   2. We investigated the effects of burning on the nutritional outcomes
   for cattle sharing habitat with wildlife in a Kenyan savanna ecosystem.
   We compared forage availability and cattle forage and nutrient intake
   rates across burned and unburned areas cattle accessed exclusively, and
   those they shared with medium-sized wild ungulates, both with and
   without megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes). We performed these
   measurements in May 2013 (wet period, 2 months post-burning) and
   February 2014 (dry period, 11 months post-burning). Additionally, we
   monitored wildlife use of these areas.
   3. Prescribed burning enhanced cattle nutrition, but only in areas
   cattle did not share with wildlife. Shared foraging with wildlife
   reduced cattle forage and nutrient intake rates by 37-97\% in burned
   areas (burns), but not in unburned areas; these reductions corresponded
   with reduced herbage availability in the shared burns.
   4. In May (the wet period), cattle met their nutrient intake
   requirements in burns, regardless of whether they were sharing these
   areas with wildlife. However, in February (the dry period), nutrient
   requirements were unmet or tended to be unmet in burns shared with
   wildlife; requirements were met or significantly exceeded in the
   unshared burns.
   5. Experimental exclusion of megaherbivores did not moderate these
   effects, suggesting that they were primarily caused by medium-sized wild
   ungulates which were highly attracted to burns.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Prescribed burning produces negative
   nutritional outcomes for cattle when sharing habitat with wild
   ungulates. Because these effects could negatively influence
   livestock-wildlife coexistence, burning should be applied prudently in
   such human-occupied savanna landscapes. Specifically, because unburned
   areas serve as refuge foraging areas during the dry season,
   interspersing burns with unburned areas could minimize fire-driven
   negative interactions between cattle and wild ungulates. Conversely,
   burning could be used to draw wildlife away from valuable cattle
   foraging areas, such as those near available water.}},

   past 30 years have prompted managers to seek ways to improve habitat
   quality for this species. Reductions in frequency of prescribed fire
   throughout considerable expanses of mature pine (Pinus spp.) forests
   have resulted in closed-canopy conditions, predominantly woody
   understory conditions, and a loss of early-successional habitats needed
   by bobwhites. Herbicides, particularly in conjunction with prescribed
   fire, may be useful for managing these pine forests to benefit the
   bobwhite and other early-successional species, but effects of herbicides
   in combination with fire are not well understood. Therefore, we used 3
   similar-aged, mature pine stands to evaluate vegetative response to
   selective herbicides with prescribed fire with respect to bobwhite
   nesting and brood-rearing habitats. Our treatments were imazapyr with
   fire, imazapyr combined with glyphosate with fire, and dormant-season
   prescribed fire only. Plant diversity tended to decline on herbicide
   treatments during the first year but increased substantially on imazapyr
   plots during the second growing season following a burn. Bobwhite food
   plants increased following application of imazapyr during the first
   growing season and were greater for both herbicide treatments than
   burning alone during the second growing season. Abundance of hardwoods
   declined on both herbicide treatments. However, no treatments produced
   bare-ground percentages known to be selected by bobwhites, and only
   prescribed fire alone created and maintained suitable escape cover.
   Overall, imazapyr with fire provided the greatest net improvement in
   vegetative conditions for bobwhites and retained floristic diversity. We
   recommend that managers target areas in which vegetative conditions have
   progressed to where burning alone is incapable of restoring
   early-successional plant communities needed by the bobwhite and other
   species and apply imazapyr with fire to create diverse, patchy habitat
   for bobwhites.}},

Abstract = {{Using coverboard arrays, we monitored woodland salamanders on the Fernow
   Experimental Forest in the central Appalachian Mountains, West Virginia,
   USA prior to and following two prescribed fires in mixed oak (Quercus
   spp.) forest stands. Treatments were burn plots on upper slopes or lower
   slopes fenced to prevent white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)
   herbivory or control plots that were unfenced and unburned. Most of the
   7 species we observed were the mountain dusky salamander (Desmognathus
   ocropheaus), red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) and slimy
   salamander (Plethodon glutinosis). Significant population responses were
   difficult to interpret with numerous treatment and year interactions.
   Results largely were equivocal. We found no change in woodland
   salamander assemblage prior to burning or afterwards. There were few
   differences in adult to juvenile ratios of salamanders among treatments.
   Still, a priori contrasts of mountain dusky salamanders and red-backed
   salamander counts corrected for detection probability were greater under
   coverboards in the 2 years monitored after both prescribed fires had
   occurred than before burning or in unburned controls. This suggests that
   these species responded to the reduced leaf litter on the forest floor
   by utilizing coverboards more. Similarly, the three predominate species
   of salamanders also were more numerous under coverboards in plots
   subjected to deer herbivory with less subsequent forest floor vegetation
   as compared to those burned plots that were fenced. Our observations
   would suggest that woodland salamanders somewhat are tolerant of two
   prescribed fires within close temporal proximity. However, because
   woodland salamanders can be significantly reduced following timber
   harvest, continued research is needed to fully understand impacts of
   fire as a pre-harvest management tool in central Appalachian forests.

Abstract = {{Forest planners must evaluate how spatiotemporal changes in habitat
   amount and configuration across the landscape as a result of timber
   management will affect species' persistence. However, there are few
   long-term programs available for evaluation. We investigated the
   response of male Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) to 26 years
   of changing patch and landscape structure during a large, 26-year
   forestry-habitat restoration program within the warbler's primary
   breeding range. We found that the average density of male Kirtland's
   Warblers was related to a different combination of patch and landscape
   attributes depending on the species' regional population level and
   habitat amounts on the landscape (early succession jack pine (Pinus
   banksiana) forests; 15-42\% habitat cover). Specifically, patch age and
   habitat regeneration type were important at low male population and
   total habitat amounts, while patch age and distance to an occupied patch
   were important at relatively high population and habitat amounts. Patch
   age and size were more important at increasing population levels and an
   intermediate amount of habitat. The importance of patch age to average
   male density during all periods reflects the temporal buildup and
   decline of male numbers as habitat suitability within the patch changed
   with succession. Habitat selection (i.e., preference for
   wildfire-regenerated habitat) and availability may explain the
   importance of habitat type and patch size during lower population and
   habitat levels. The relationship between male density and distance when
   there was the most habitat on the landscape and the male population was
   large and still increasing may be explained by the widening spatial
   dispersion of the increasing male population at the regional scale.
   Because creating or preserving habitat is not a random process,
   management efforts would benefit from more investigations of managed
   population responses to changes in spatial structure that occur through
   habitat gain rather than habitat loss to further our empirical
   understanding of general principles of the fragmentation process and
   habitat cover threshold effects within dynamic landscapes. Published by

Abstract = {{A potential consequence of climate change, altered fire regimes, and a
   legacy of resource exploitation in western North America is increased
   displacement of desirable sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) communities by
   invasive plant species. Annually, an estimated 90,000 ha of sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus spp.) habitat is degraded by pinyon (Pinus spp.) and
   juniper (Juniperus spp.; PJ) encroachment. Sage-grouse responses to
   conifer encroachment may include avoidance of otherwise available
   habitats, lek abandonment, and subsequent population declines. Thus,
   restoration of PJ encroached sage-grouse habitats that exhibit intact
   sagebrush understories is a priority conservation action. However,
   better information is needed regarding sage-grouse response to these
   management actions. We used sage-grouse fecal pellet surveys and
   radiotelemetry location data to identify vegetation and landscape
   attributes that may influence sage-grouse use of PJ removal treatments
   completed using mechanical methods. Use of PJ removal treatments by
   sagegrouse was positively associated with irrigated pasture and alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa) hay within 1 km (beta = 7.69, SE = 5.58, P = 0.17) and
   negatively associated with PJ canopy cover (beta = - 1.52, SE = 0.84, P
   = 0.07) within 500m of treatments. Percent cover of mesic habitats and
   sagebrush canopy were greater within 1 km of treatments where
   sage-grouse were detected; however, these relationships were weak
   because of large variability in conditions across sites. Our results
   document sage-grouse use of 9 of 16 mechanical PJ removal treatments
   examined in an encroached sagebrush landscape and suggest that
   mechanical PJ removal treatments should be sited adjacent to occupied
   sage-grouse habitat in areas that minimize surrounding PJ cover. (C)

Abstract = {{Information on the response of the endangered Florida grasshopper
   sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus Mearns) to range management,
   especially prescribed fire, is needed to determine conservation
   strategies. Intensive management of grasslands for cattle grazing and
   conversion of grassland to other agricultural use is considered the
   greatest threat to the sparrow. Territory spot-mapping and estimates of
   reproductive success were examined in relation to time post-burn in
   managed cattle pastures at Avon Park Air Force Range, Highlands County,
   Florida from 1997-1999. We tested the hypothesis that sparrow density
   and reproductive success did not depend on time following fire. Contrary
   to previous work, there was no evidence that Florida grasshopper sparrow
   territory density depended on years post-burn (P = 0.842). The
   probability of reproductive success was significantly higher 0.5 year
   post-burn than at 1.5 years post-burn (P < 0.05) and 2.5 years post-burn
   (P < 0.01). No other significant differences were observed among years
   post-burn (P > 0.27 for each pairwise comparison between years). No
   simple trend or highly significant polynomial relationship between
   reproductive success and territory density was indicated (P > 0.41).
   Compared to other subspecies, Florida grasshopper sparrows exhibited
   relatively low density (0.22 territories/ha or less) and reproductive
   success (20\%). Our results suggest increased reproductive success at a
   population level 0.5 year following fire, and did not suggest an
   association between territory density and individual reproductive
   success. Additional information is needed on the effects of seasonality

Abstract = {{The responses of tallgrass prairie plant communities and ecosystem
   processes to fire and grazing are well characterized. However, responses
   of invertebrate consumer groups, and particularly soil-dwelling
   organisms, to these disturbances are not well known. At Konza Prairie
   Biological Station, we sampled soil macroinvertebrates in 1994 and 1999
   as part of a long-term experiment designed to examine the effects and
   interactions of annual fire, mowing, and fertilization (N and P) on
   prairie soil communities and processes. For nearly all taxa, in both
   years, responses were characterized by significant treatment
   interactions, but some general patterns were evident. Introduced
   European earthworms (Aporrectodea spp. and Octolasion spp.) were most
   abundant in plots where fire was excluded, and the proportion of the
   total earthworm community consisting of introduced earthworms was
   greater in unburned, unmowed, and fertilized plots. Nymphs of two Cicada
   genera were collected (Cicadetta spp. and Tibicen spp.). Cicadetta
   nymphs were more abundant in burned plots, but mowing reduced their
   abundance. Tibicen nymphs were collected almost exclusively from
   unburned plots. Treatment effects on herbivorous beetle larvae
   (Scarabaeidae, Elateridae, and Curculionidae) were variable, but
   nutrient additions (N or P) usually resulted in greater densities,
   whereas mowing usually resulted in lower densities. Our results suggest
   that departures from historical disturbance regimes (i.e. frequent fire
   and grazing) may render soils more susceptible to increased numbers of
   European earthworms, and that interactions between fire, aboveground
   biomass removal, and vegetation responses affect the structure and
   composition of invertebrate communities in tallgrass prairie soils. (C)

Abstract = {{Many conservationists are concerned about reports of declining
   populations of scrub-shrub birds. Wildlife opening management, involving
   repeatedly burning or mechanically treating early-successional stands,

   scrub-shrub habitat and have the advantage of potentially generating
   revenue, but the relative effectiveness of wildlife opening management

   concern. These differences were attributable to differences in habitat
   characteristics between treatments. The overall probability of a nest

Abstract = {{As part of the multidisciplinary National Fire and Fire Surrogate Study,
   we used drift fences with pitfall traps to determine how three fuel
   reduction treatments affected ground-dwelling macroarthropods in the
   southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. Four experimental
   units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of three replicate
   blocks. Treatments were (1) prescribed burning, (2) mechanical felling
   of shrubs and small trees, (3) mechanical felling + burning, and (4)
   untreated controls. Mechanical understory felling was conducted in
   winter 2001-2002, and prescribed burning was conducted in March 2003.
   Mechanical felling + burning resulted in greater canopy openness
   compared with the other treatments as a result of hotter fires and
   elevated levels of subsequent tree mortality. Burning reduced leaf
   litter depth in both burned treatments by >80\%. We captured 6,776
   individual macroarthropods (460 g of dry biomass) within 22 identified
   orders and 59 identified families. Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were
   numerically dominant (27.3 and 25.9\%, respectively); Lepidoptera larvae
   also were a dominant component of dry biomass (37\%). We found no
   differences among treatments in the relative abundance or dry biomass of
   total ground-dwelling macroarthropods or within most orders; Hymenoptera
   (predominantly Formicidae) dry biomass was greater with mechanical
   felling + burning than with mechanical felling. Total relative abundance
   and dry biomass were low in spring and higher in late summer. Our
   results indicate that prescribed burning and mechanical fuel reduction
   treatments conducted in winter or early spring have little impact on the
   community composition, relative abundance, or biomass of total
   arthropods or most arthropod orders and families, at least in the short
   term. However, because we did not use a killing agent, our trapping
   method probably undersampled macroarthropods that could climb or fly
   from traps, and results for those groups should be interpreted
   cautiously. Our study suggests that the fuel reduction methods studied
   may be used as a land management tool in upland hardwood forest with
   little effect on macroarthropod communities or the ground-dwelling
   arthropod prey base for vertebrates. FOR. Sci. 56(1):112-121.}},

Abstract = {{Tanzania rangelands are a stronghold for biodiversity harbouring a

Abstract = {{Biodiversity elements with narrow niches and restricted distributions
   (i.e., `short range endemics,' SREs) are particularly vulnerable to

   willardi obscurus, CWO), an SRE listed under the U.S. Endangered Species
   Act within three sky islands of southwestern North America, is
   constrained at low elevation by drought and at high elevation by
   wildfire. We combined long-term recapture and molecular data with
   demographic and niche modeling to gauge its climate-driven status,
   distribution, and projected longevity. The largest population (Animas)
   is numerically constricted (N = 151), with few breeding adults (N-b =
   24) and an elevated inbreeding coefficient (Delta F = 0.77; 100 years).
   Mean home range (0.07km(2)) is significantly smaller compared to other
   North American rattlesnakes, and movements are within, not among sky
   islands. Demographic values, when gauged against those displayed by
   other endangered/Red-Listed reptiles {[}e.g., Loggerhead Sea Turtle
   (Caretta caretta)], are either comparable or markedly lower. Survival
   rate differs significantly between genders (female<male) and life
   history stages (juvenile<adult) while a steadily declining population
   trajectory (r = -0.20 +/- 0.03) underscores the shallow
   predicted-time-to-extinction (17.09 +/- 2.05 years). Core habitat is
   receding upwards in elevation and will shift 750km NW under conservative
   climate estimates. While survival is significantly impacted by wildfire
   at upper elevations, the extinction vortex is driven by small population
   demographics, a situation comparable to that of the European Adder
   (Vipera berus), a conservation icon in southern Sweden. Genetic rescue,
   a management approach successfully employed in similar situations, is
   ill advised in this situation due to climate-driven habitat change in
   the sky islands. CWO is a rare organism in a unique environment, with a
   conserved niche and a predisposition towards extinction. It is a
   bellwether for the eventual climate-driven collapse of the Madrean

Abstract = {{Ptychosperma bleeseri is an endangered endemic palm known from eight
   rainforests near Darwin in the Northern Territory. Management actions
   target the threat of habitat disturbance from fire, weeds and introduced
   animals (buffalo, cattle and pigs). Population data from 1990 and 1995
   are presented for adult and juvenile palms, along with more detailed
   size class data for one population for the period from 1992 to 1995.
   There has been a positive response in the survival and growth of
   juvenile P. bleeseri in two populations where introduced animals have
   been controlled. This response reflects a general increase in the cover
   of rainforest understorey species through a reduction in trampling and
   grazing by introduced animals.
   A third population has been affected by wildfire twice in the last five
   years. It has lost more than 75\% of adult and more than 50\% of
   juvenile plants. Fire effects are apparent in other components of the
   rainforest, including formation of canopy gaps and the invasion of weedy
   grasses. Trends in P. bleeseri populations may provide a useful index of
   the health of the rainforests and illustrate the impact of disturbance
   by fire and introduced animals. Ptychosperma bleeseri provides an
   example where the management of an endangered species confers a
   significant conservation benefit for the habitat through addressing
   commonly occurring disturbance factors which impinge, more generally, on
   rainforests throughout the Northern Territory.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To compare fire behaviour and fire management practice at a site
   managed continuously by traditional Aboriginal owners with other sites
   in tropical northern Australia, including the nearby Kakadu National
   Park, and relate those observations to indicators of landscape
   condition.
   Location Dukaladjarranj, a clan estate in north-central Arnhem Land, in
   the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. The site abuts a vast
   sandstone plateau that is an internationally recognized cent re of plant
   and animal biodiversity.
   Methods Ecological assessments included: (1) mapping of the resource
   base of the estate from both traditional and ecological perspectives;
   (2) aerial survey of the extent of burning, distribution of the
   fire-sensitive native pine Callitris intratropica, rock habitats, and a
   range of macropod and other fauna resources; (3) fauna inventory; (4)
   detailed ecological assessment of the status of fire-sensitive
   vegetation; and (5) empirical assessment of the intensities of
   experimental fires. Ethnographic information concerning traditional fire
   management practice was documented in interviews with senior custodians.
   Results Experimental fires lit during the study were of low intensity
   compared with late dry season fires reported elsewhere, despite weather
   conditions favouring rapid combustion. In contrast to other parts of the
   savanna, fuel loads comprised mostly leaf litter and little grass. We
   found that (i) a large proportion of the estate had been burned during
   the year of the study (ii) burned sires attracted important animal food
   resources such as large macropods (iii) important plant foods remained
   abundant (iv) well represented in the landscape were fire sensitive
   vegetation types (e.g. Callitris intratropica Baker \& Smith woodlands)
   and slow growing sandstone `heath' typically dominated by myrtaceaous
   and proteaceous shrubs (v) diversity of vertebrate fauna was high,
   including rare or range-restricted species (vi) exotic plants were all
   but absent. Traditional practice includes regular, smaller fires, lit
   throughout the year, and cooperation with neighbouring clans in planning
   and implementing burning regimes.
   Main conclusions We attribute the ecological integrity of the site to
   continued human occupation and maintenance of traditional fire
   management practice, which suppresses otherwise abundant annual grasses
   (Sorghum spp.) and limits accumulation of fuels in perennial grasses
   (Triodia spp.) or other litter. Suppression of fuels and coordination of
   fire use combine to greatly reduce wildfire risk and to produce and
   maintain diverse habitats. Aboriginal people derive clear economic
   benefits from this style of management, as evidenced by abundant and
   diverse animal and plant foods. However, the motives for the Aboriginal
   management system are complex and include the fulfillment of social and
   religious needs, a factor that remains important to Aboriginal people
   despite the rapid and ongoing transformation of their traditional
   lifestyles. The implication of this study is that the maintenance of the
   biodiversity of the Arnhem Land plateau requires intensive, skilled
   management that can be best achieved by developing co-operative
   programmes with local indigenous communities.}},

Abstract = {{Over a 12-year period (1992-2003), we examined the impact of prescribed
   burning and hardwood removal on a population of nine-banded armadillos
   (Dasypus novemcinctus) located at Tall Timbers Research Station just
   north of Tallahassee, Florida. Although these armadillos are often found
   in close proximity to humans, there currently are no data on how they
   are affected by human impacts on the environment. Responses to annual
   burns between 1992-1997 indicated that in some years armadillos,
   particularly adults, avoided areas that had been burned, but effects
   were inconsistent and relatively weak. In contrast, hardwood removal
   during 1998-2000 coincided with a significant decline in population
   numbers that continued through 2003. However, interpretation of hardwood
   removal effects was complicated by the occurrence of a severe drought
   during the same time period. Comparisons between animals in logged and
   unlogged parts of the study area during the period of hardwood removal
   revealed few differences, suggesting drought was an important influence.
   However, because our population continued to decline after the drought
   ended, it seems likely that hardwood removal generated more persistent
   effects that were temporarily masked by the drought. We observed
   armadillos frequently in logged areas, probably because few other
   habitat choices were available. Armadillos weighed less during and after
   hardwood removal than prior to it. Although adult reproductive behavior
   appeared largely unaffected by logging, numbers of juveniles captured
   and recruited declined significantly with the onset of hardwood removal.
   There was no evidence that the disturbance from logging caused increases
   in distances moved by animals that remained in the study area. Our
   results may have broader implications for predicting how armadillo
   populations in Latin America will be affected by similar land management
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{On many occasions fire crews tasked to suppress fires at night in rugged
   landscapes have been surprised by fire intensity on mid slopes. While it
   has long been stated that this is due to a thermal belt, no studies have
   been done into how this occurs or the magnitude of its impact on fire
   behaviour.
   Radiative heat loss at night leads to cooling of surface air and
   subsequent density-driven drainage and pooling. This can produce a
   nocturnal inversion below the mid-slopes of a valley, and has been the
   subject of numerous studies of its effects on agriculture. The resultant
   pattern in weather can also be significant for fire managers. Mid slopes
   can be significantly warmer and drier than valley floors or ridgetops,
   and are termed the thermal belt. The formation of a thermal belt
   requires a continental air mass and light or no winds.
   A terrain model has been developed to show the formation pattern and
   intensity of the thermal belt. It uses adiabatic lapse rates, slope
   position and drainage patterns to model distinct dynamic elements of the
   system. When combined these provide a useful indication of the extent of
   the belt.
   Initially the model looks at a sunset temperature reading and uses the
   dry adiabatic lapse rate to estimate temperature across a local
   catchment. An ambient cooling rate of about 1 degrees C per hour applies
   to the entire system. Then the effects of radiative heat loss from the
   ground are considered. The portion of this that is transferred to air in
   contact with the ground makes that air denser. This air then flows along
   fall lines until it reaches a drainage line. Air flowing along the
   drainage becomes density stratified due to unequal sideslope drainage
   times. The time taken to reach the exit-point of the catchment can be
   readily estimated in the field.
   An additional consideration is pooling of cold air in the low points of
   the landscape. Some straightforward geometric techniques can be used to
   estimate the pooling depth at any point with time, as drainage flows
   from an increasing fraction of the area arrive.
   While the current model is empirical, there is a need for further work
   towards a physical model. The model successfully indicates the formation
   of a thermal belt with time after sunset. As the thermal belt develops,
   and using assumptions about variations in dew point temperature, it
   possible to use the model to estimate changes in fire behavior over
   time, across the catchment. More work is underway to link this model
   into bushfire management requirements.}},

   dynamics of greater sage-grouse populations}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Life histories determine how organisms interact with their environment
   and predict how populations respond to environmental change.
   Understanding relationships between life histories and environmental
   variability is therefore crucial for effective conservation under
   changing environmental conditions. Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus) is a species of major conservation concern in western
   North America following widespread disturbance of the sagebrush
   ecosystems to which they are endemic. Using robust design and Pradel
   capture-mark-recapture models, we evaluated the influence of climatic
   processes and disturbance associated with post-wildfire exotic grass
   invasion on annual survival, per-capita recruitment, and population
   growth of breeding male sage-grouse in eastern Nevada, USA. Climatic
   processes, indexed by annual rainfall and maximum summertime
   temperatures, had a strong relationship with recruitment and adult
   survival, respectively. The range of variation in recruitment during the
   study was greater than the range of variation in survival, consistent
   with a life-history strategy that features lengthened lifespan to
   capitalize on periodically favorable reproductive conditions. Annual
   variation in precipitation variables (e. g., rainfall or snow depth)
   explained as much as 75\% of the annual variance in population size
   during the study. Our results are consistent with bottom-up regulation
   of sage-grouse populations, where abundance is determined in large part
   by climate-driven variation in resource availability. Exotic grasslands
   had a negative influence on recruitment that was interactive with annual
   rainfall; recruitment was consistently low in areas with a substantial
   exotic grassland footprint even following years of favorable rainfall.
   We found males breeding at leks with substantial exotic grassland
   impacts had lower annual survival compared to males at leks surrounded
   by native sagebrush habitats. However, models containing an interaction
   between exotic grasslands and maximum summer temperature were not
   clearly superior to models that considered only additive effects of the
   two variables. This research has significant implications for
   sage-grouse persistence in a changing climate, where more frequent
   drought and increased spread of exotic grasslands will have negative
   impacts on sage-grouse populations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Questions Reordering of dominant species is an important mechanism of
   community response to global environmental change. We asked how wildfire
   (a pulse event) interacts with directional changes in climate
   (environmental presses) to affect plant community dynamics in a
   Chihuahuan Desert grassland.
   Location Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, Socorro County, New Mexico,
   USA.
   Methods Vegetation cover by species was measured twice each year from
   1989 to 2019 along two permanently located 400-m long line intercept
   transects, one in Chihuahuan Desert grassland, and the second in the
   ecotone between Chihuahuan Desert and Great Plains grasslands. Trends in
   community structure were plotted over time, and climate sensitivity
   functions were used to predict how changes in the Pacific Decadal
   Oscillation (PDO) affected vegetation dynamics.
   Results Community composition was undergoing gradual change in the
   absence of disturbance in the ecotone and desert grassland. These
   changes were related to the reordering of abundances between two
   foundation grasses, Bouteloua eriopoda and B. gracilis, that together
   account for >80\% of above-ground primary production. However,
   reordering varied over time in response to wildfire (a pulse) and
   changes in the PDO (a press). Community dynamics were initially related
   to the warm and cool phases of the PDO, but in the ecotone these
   relationships changed following wildfire, which reset the system.
   Conclusion Species reordering is an important component of community
   dynamics in response to ecological presses. However, reordering is a
   complex, non-linear process in response to ecological presses that may
   change over time and interact with pulse disturbances.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and red-cockaded woodpeckers
   (Picoides borealis) use mature pine woodlands characterized by
   well-spaced pines, an open midstory, and a dense understory of grasses
   and forbs. Populations of the Bachman's sparrow began declining in the
   1930s, with both a dramatic retraction in geographic distribution and
   the extinction of many local populations. Current land management
   practices in the southeastern United States often focus on the habitat
   requirements of the red-cockaded woodpecker without considering other
   species with similar habitat requirements (i.e., Bachman's sparrow). We
   examined habitat requirements of the Bachman's sparrow on Eglin Air
   Force Base, Florida, to determine if management practices directed at
   recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers are providing Bachman's sparrows
   with suitable habitat. Comparisons between active red-cockaded
   woodpecker clusters occupied (n = 8) and unoccupied (n = 13) by
   Bachman's sparrows showed that Bachman's sparrows selected areas with a
   dense understory of grasses and sparse midstory vegetation. Areas
   suitable for red-cockaded woodpeckers were not always suitable for
   Bachman's sparrows. Red-cockaded woodpeckers appear more tolerant of a
   hardwood midstory and do not require a dense cover of grasses and forbs.
   Prescribed burning is key for development and maintenance of the dense
   herbaceous understory preferred by Bachman's sparrow. In areas managed
   for red-cockaded woodpeckers, frequent (3-5 yr) burning early in the
   growing season appears the best way to increase habitat suitability for

Abstract = {{Seedling recruitment shapes tree communities, including those found in
   altered landscapes such as urban forests. However, little data exists on
   local- and broad-scale tree seed immigration and recruitment in these
   communities. Interspecific competition and seed predation are two major
   causes of recruitment failure for plants. In North American urban
   forests, these pressures may be exacerbated by an altered disturbance
   regime and prevalent invasive species combined with dense populations of
   rodents and browsers. Preliminary investigation in an urban forest on
   the eastern shore of Lake Erie indicated very low long-term tree
   seedling recruitment in the mature canopy stands. Our competing
   hypotheses were that seed establishment (habitat suitability) and seed
   limitations (seed availability) explained the tree recruitment failure.
   We tested seed establishment using field experiments (burning and
   vertebrate herbivore exclosures) and seed limitation by introducing
   native tree seeds. Moreover, we tested also seed limitation by examining
   local and regional seed input using seed traps. We found that seedling
   recruitment increased significantly with experimental reductions in
   predators and competitors, suggesting strong biotic establishment
   limitations in the urban forest. In addition, seed rain correlated
   significantly with immediately proximate parent plants, but no species
   arrived beyond what occurs within 50 m of the experimental plots.
   Essentially, then, the existing canopy species are not replacing
   themselves and extant seeds are not immigrating to replace them. At the
   patch scale, habitat quality, particularly seed predation and browsing,
   as well as competition from nonnative understory shrubs, constrained
   native tree recruitment in the urban forest. At the landscape scale, the
   evidence of poor long-term seed recruitment and the lack of
   long-distance seed input also suggest low native tree seed availability.
   The tree recruitment failure suggests that, in the absence of active
   management, this urban forest may eventually convert to an
   invasive-species dominated urban shrubland.}},

Title = {{Trade-offs in berry production and biodiversity under prescribed burning

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1658-1667}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Green tree retention and prescribed burning are the practices used to
   mitigate negative effects of boreal forestry. Beside their effects on
   biodiversity, these practices should also promote non-timber forest
   products (NTFPs). We assessed: (1) how prescribed burning and tree
   retention influence NTFPs by examining the production of bilberry,
   Vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry, Vaccinium vitis-idaea; (2) if there
   are synergies or trade-offs in the delivery of these NTFPs in relation
   to the delivery of species richness, focusing on five groups of
   forest-dwelling species.
   2. We used a long-term experiment located in eastern Finland, with three
   different harvesting treatments: clear-cut logging, logging with
   retention patches and unlogged, which were combined with or without
   prescribed burning. Eleven years after the treatment application, we
   scored plant cover and berry production in different microhabitats
   within these treatments, while species richness data for five species
   groups (ground layer lichens and bryophytes, vascular plants, saproxylic
   beetles, pollinators-here bees and hoverflies) were collected at the
   stand level.
   3. Logging favoured cowberry production, particularly for plants growing
   in the vicinity of stumps. Logging was detrimental for cover and berry
   production of bilberry. Retention mitigated these negative effects
   slightly, but cover and berry production were still substantially lower
   compared to unlogged forests. Prescribed burning increased the cowberry
   production in retention patches and in unlogged forest. Bilberry
   production decreased with burning, except in unlogged forest where the
   effect was neutral.
   4. No single management treatment simultaneously favoured all
   values-NTFPs and richness-and trade-offs among values were common. Only
   bilberry production and beetle diversity were higher under retention
   forestry, or in unlogged stands, compared to logged stands. Prescribed
   burning favoured many values when performed in combination with
   retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, but different treatment
   combinations favoured different species groups.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that widely
   applied conservation practices in managed boreal forests are unlikely to
   benefit all ecosystem values everywhere. If high multifunctionality is
   desired, managing at a landscape scale, countering the local trade-offs
   among values, may be more appropriate than the stand-scale conservation
   practices commonly practiced today.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDCogongrass (Imperata cylindrica Beav.) is an aggressive,
   invasive weed with a global distribution. In North America, it threatens
   the integrity of southeastern pine agroecosystems, including longleaf
   pine (Pinus palustris Mill.). While studies have examined the impacts of
   cogongrass and various vegetation management strategies on longleaf pine
   understory plant communities, little is known about how they impact
   associated insect communities. To understand the effect of cogongrass
   management strategies on arthropod natural enemies and bark beetles, a
   split-plot design was used to test fire (whole-plot) and four subplot
   treatments (control, herbicide, seeding and herbicide plus seeding).
   Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps and sweep samples.
   RESULTSAfter 2 years of sampling, total natural enemies were not
   significantly affected by subplot treatment but were affected by burn
   treatment. Upon subdividing natural enemies into groups, only spiders
   were significantly affected by subplot treatment, but predatory beetles
   and ants were significantly affected by burn treatment. The abundance of
   root-feeding bark beetles (Hylastes spp.) was not significant by subplot
   or whole-plot treatments.
   CONCLUSIONSMultiple applications of herbicide remain the most effective
   way to manage cogongrass in longleaf pine. In this study, we found
   limited evidence that cogongrass management with herbicides would
   negatively impact arthropod natural enemies associated with longleaf
   pine or locally increase root-feeding bark beetles. (c) 2014 Society of

   conservation of forest fungi}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{457}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The influence of forest management on fungal diversity and community
   composition has been the subject of a wide number of studies over the
   last two decades. However, the difficulty of studying the complex
   kingdom of fungi under real forest conditions has led to rather
   scattered scientific knowledge. Here, we provide the current state of
   knowledge suggesting future research directions regarding (i) stand
   structure attributes (age, tree cover, stand density, tree species
   composition), (ii) management history (managed vs unmanaged), (iii)
   silvicultural treatments (thinning, clearcutting, shelterwood methods,
   selective cutting) and (iv) other anthropogenic disturbances (mushroom
   picking, salvage logging, prescribed burning, fertilization) affecting
   fungal diversity and community composition. The reviewed studies
   reported a positive correlation between fungal diversity and stand
   structure variables such as canopy cover, basal area of the stand and
   tree species diversity, particularly for mycorrhizal species. Abundance
   and diversity in size, tree species and decomposition stage of deadwood
   are reported as positively related to richness of wood-inhabiting fungi.
   The main findings about the effects of silvicultural practices suggest
   that the higher is the management intensity the lower is the diversity
   of ectomycorrhizal and wood-inhabiting species, at least in the short
   term. We have therefore reported those silvicultural practices which may
   reduce trade-offs between timber harvesting and fungal diversity
   conservation. Indeed, fungal diversity can be conserved in managed
   forests if (i) low impact logging operations are performed; (ii) stand
   structural complexity and late-successional forest characteristics are
   enhanced; (iii) deadwood amount and diversity is promoted, (iv)
   landscape heterogeneity and connectivity is improved or maintained.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of savanna habitat in the upper Midwest has resulted in a
   decline of savanna and grassland birds. Many savanna restoration efforts
   involve the re-introduction of fire, a method which kills fire-sensitive
   trees, often leaving them standing as snags. The purpose of this study
   was to assess how the number of snags (standing dead trees) is
   associated with the breeding bird community and to document how the
   number of snags at a site varied over a 23 y period of restoration by
   fire. The effect of snags on bird communities was studied by
   establishing bird census plots along a wide range of snag abundances. To
   determine for what purposes birds utilized snags, observers documented
   all visits during an hour-long period for pairs of a dead and live tree.
   Change in the abundance of snags over time was documented over 23 y in a
   16 ha grid. We found both bird species richness and abundance were
   positively associated with the number of snags and that birds used dead
   trees for mating and reproductive purposes more than live trees. We
   found the introduction of fire for restoration purposes initially
   resulted in an increase in the number of snags, but repeated fires
   eventually caused the number of snags to decline substantially. If a
   primary goal of savanna restoration is to enhance breeding bird
   community, our results show how burn regimes can be managed to maximize
   the number of dead tree snags for as long as possible.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   The upland moorlands of Great Britain form distinctive landscapes of
   international conservation importance, comprising mosaics of heathland,
   acid grassland, blanket bog and bracken. Much of this landscape is
   managed by rotational burning to create gamebird habitat and there is
   concern over whether this is driving long-term changes in upland
   vegetation communities. However, the inaccessibility and scale of
   uplands means that monitoring changes in vegetation and burning
   practices is difficult. We aim to overcome this problem by developing
   methods to classify aerial imagery into high-resolution maps of dominant
   vegetation cover, including the distribution of burns on managed grouse
   moors.
   Location
   Peak District National Park, England, UK.
   Methods
   Colour and infrared aerial photographs were classified into seven
   dominant land-cover classes using the Random Forest ensemble machine
   learning algorithm. In addition, heather (Calluna vulgaris) was further
   differentiated into growth phases, including sites that were newly
   burnt. We then analysed the distributions of the vegetation classes and
   managed burning using detrended correspondence analysis.
   Results
   Classification accuracy was c. 95\% and produced a 5-m resolution map
   for 514 km2 of moorland. Cover classes were highly aggregated and strong
   nonlinear effects of elevation and slope and weaker effects of aspect
   and bedrock type were evident in structuring moorland vegetation
   communities. The classification revealed the spatial distribution of
   managed burning and suggested that relatively steep areas may be
   disproportionately burnt.
   Main conclusions
   Random Forest classification of aerial imagery is an efficient method
   for producing high-resolution maps of upland vegetation. These may be
   used to monitor long-term changes in vegetation and management burning
   and infer species-environment relationships and can therefore provide an
   important tool for effective conservation at the landscape scale.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores and pathogens impact the species composition, ecosystem
   function, and socioeconomic value of forests. Herbivores and pathogens
   are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable
   effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a
   few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to
   20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed \$1
   billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from
   herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development
   and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in
   tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of
   natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists
   (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of
   their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and
   physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change
   will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest
   insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in
   North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their
   responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12
   pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest
   decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and
   pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value,
   forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial
   (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect
   pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate
   insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and
   climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and
   their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and
   pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to
   climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems;
   one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect
   outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires
   and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from
   boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will
   allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management
   strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and
   mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   woodlands following drought-induced mortality}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{341}},
Pages = {{18-29}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Two decades of drought and rising temperatures have triggered bark
   beetle outbreaks and extensive mortality of Colorado pinon (Pinus
   edulis) and Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) across the southwest
   US. For example from 2002 to 2005, over one-third of the pinons in Mesa
   Verde National Park's old-growth woodlands were killed by the bark
   beetle Ips confusus and other drought-related factors. Extensive
   wild-fires have also burned through the Park over the last two decades,
   reducing the extent of old-growth woodlands by nearly one-half. We
   compared historical (1970-19905) and recent (2005-2011) data to gauge
   the effects of the 2002-2005 mortality event on canopy structure, woody
   surface fuels, and tree recruitment. Large, mature pinons were the most
   susceptible to mortality; we measured significant reductions in pinon
   cover and diameter. Due to the loss of large trees, woodlands that were
   subjected to substantial mortality had reduced structural complexity
   relative to nearby unaffected stands. In a longitudinal fuels
   comparison, 2010-2011 fuels were compared to historical 1993 values in
   the same plots; we could not detect a change in woody fuel load. However
   when the 2010-2011 fuels are compared across mortality severity classes,
   there was a trend toward slightly greater 1-100 h, greater 1000 h fuel
   loads, and more litter in stands with higher levels of tree mortality.
   However, modeled surface fire behavior did not differ across mortality
   severity classes. Modeled crown fires needed higher wind speeds to
   spread from tree to tree in stands without tree mortality, but this is
   likely due to the inherently more open canopy structure in stands that
   resisted mortality rather than due to tree mortality per se.
   Post-mortality pinon reproduction and recruitment were recorded from
   2005 to 2011 and compared with NPS monitoring data from 1975 to 1995.
   Cone production in 2005 was comparable to historical trends, but recent
   seedling and sapling densities were significantly below historical
   values. Yearly seedling and sapling density in 1975-2011 was positively
   correlated with precipitation during the sampling year and two years
   prior. The largest proportion of seedlings and saplings occurred under
   pinon or juniper canopies, and a smaller proportion under native shrubs.
   Given the loss of a substantial component of the adult trees, reduced
   stand structural complexity, and demonstrated need for moist conditions
   and nurse plants for effective recruitment, these old-growth woodlands
   may be vulnerable to decline under future warm and dry climate
   projections. Management strategies focusing on maintaining structural
   features of both the overstory and understory could help provide
   conditions for sustainable recruitment and contribute to the goal of
   conservation of rare old-growth pinon-juniper woodlands. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Herpetofauna are frequently cited as ideal indicators for environmental
   and restoration monitoring due to their importance to ecological
   functioning, dominance of vertebrate biomass, and sensitivity to
   environmental change. Despite this relevance, herpetofauna have yet to
   be fully integrated into comprehensive, community-scale restoration
   monitoring methodologies. We tested the applicability of one such
   method, abundance-biomass comparisons (ABCs), to monitoring restoration
   success in a longleaf pine ecosystem currently undergoing restoration
   via prescribed burning. W statistics (a metric of environmental
   perturbation) for herpetofaunal assemblages in longleaf pine stands
   managed under varying fire intervals closely tracked forest succession
   from recently burned longleaf pine stands to those characterized by
   longer times since last burn and high levels of hardwood encroachment.
   Our results suggest that ABCs may be an applicable method for
   terrestrial restoration monitoring that encompasses entire faunal
   assemblages and allows for generality in restoration or disturbance
   response. We emphasize, however, that applications of this method and
   others need to take into account the specific ecological characteristics
   of study organisms and the natural history of study sites to avoid
   incorrect interpretations of disturbance response and inappropriate

Abstract = {{Although forest wildfires threaten to impoverish vast expanses of once
   fire-resistant humid tropical forest, their effects on the vertebrate
   fauna remain poorly understood. We report results from a study in
   central Brazilian Amazonia examining a large area of terra firma
   (unflooded) forest that had been affected by fires during the 1997-1998
   El Nino-mediated dry season. By sampling 0.25-ha forest plots both one
   and three years after fire disturbance, we noted that over time the bird
   community became increasingly dissimilar from that in unburned control
   plots. The influences of burn severity and recurrent fires were then
   examined across 28 plots that were all sampled three years after the
   fires. Foraging guilds differed in their responses to the gradient of
   increasing burn severity; most guilds declined, although arboreal
   granivores, frugivores, and nectarivores showed unimodal responses and
   arboreal gleaning insectivores increased. These responses were strongly
   correlated with associated changes in the habitat structure and
   reflected differences in resource abundance where this was quantified.
   Rates of species turnover were high, and there was virtually no species
   overlap between unburned forest plots and those that had burned in more
   than one El Nino dry season. Our results indicate that, unless
   conservation strategies can prevent a recurrent fire regime from
   becoming established in seasonally dry tropical forests, only nonforest

   in measuring North American tallgrass prairie quality}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{58-64}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auchenorrhyncha (i.e., leafhoppers, treehoppers, spittlebugs, and
   planthoppers) represent some of the most diverse groups of herbivorous
   insects in the tallgrass prairie biome, they have close associations
   with many native prairie grasses and forbs, and respond in predictable
   ways to changes in native grassland degradation. These attributes make
   Auchenorrhyncha ideal candidates in the development of a habitat quality
   index to measure tallgrass prairie quality. In this study we propose the
   development of a species-based habitat quality index called the
   Auchenorrhyncha quality index or AQI as a useful method in tracking the
   condition of tallgrass prairie quality. The AQI is computed by summing
   six ecological characteristics (i.e., host plant specificity, voltinism,
   overwintering microhabitat, wing length, habitat fidelity, and origin)
   for each Auchenorrhynchan insect encountered, yielding coefficient of
   conservatism (CC) values that range from 0 (habitat generalist/tolerant
   to disturbance) to 18 (habitat specific/intolerant to disturbance).
   These CC values are averaged and combined with species richness
   producing un-weighted by abundance AQI (AQI(w/outN)) and weighted by
   abundance AQI (AQI(w/N)). The performance of the AQI was evaluated by
   examining the effects of sampling intensity on this index using a sweep
   net and a vacuum apparatus from 10 sites located on the three main North
   American tallgrass prairie communities, wet-mesic, sand, and loess hill.
   Scientists and land managers can adequately sample Auchenorrhyncha from
   four transects using a vacuum. Also, the highest AQI values were found
   from loess hill and sand prairies, indicating that conservation efforts
   should focus on these prairie communities. Additional applications of
   the AQI may include: (1) discriminating prairie quality at various
   spatial scales; (2) testing hypotheses about the effects of disturbance
   on prairie habitat (e.g. prescribed burning); (3) using the AQI as a
   model in developing habitat quality indices based on other diverse
   groups of grassland insects: and (4) the AQI has the capacity to be
   readily modified in assessing the quality of other biomes. Ultimately,
   the AQI should be used in combination with other habitat quality indices
   based on other diverse groups of organisms, such as plants and other
   insects, to provide a more complete assessment of native habitat
   quality. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The boreal forest covers 14\% of the earth's vegetated surface but
   contains about 27\% of the world's vegetation carbon and between 25\%
   and 30\% of the world's soil carbon. Unique features of this biome
   include cold climates, large areas of relatively flat topography,
   discontinuous permafrost, large and severe fire events, and the
   accumulation of peat. These characteristics are important in controlling
   energy and carbon cycling and either influence or are influenced by
   regional climate and hydrological regimes. Total carbon accumulation
   within an ecosystem reflects the balance between net primary production
   (NPP), decomposition, and nonrespiratory losses (dissolved carbon
   export, fire, and land-use changes). In this chapter, we use soil carbon
   storage as a long-term estimate of net ecosystem productivity (NEP; the
   balance between NPP and decomposition) and nonrespiratory losses that
   integrates annual variability in the ecosystem processes contributing to
   carbon balance. Our overall hypothesis is that a combination of regional
   and local physiography creates spatial heterogeneity in hydrology and
   soil temperatures. Hydrology and thermal regimes, in turn, influence
   distributions of fire, permafrost, peatlands, and vegetation and
   ultimately control long-term carbon storage in many boreal climatic
   zones. Soil carbon storage varies tremendously between boreal stand
   types or features and is particularly large in poorly drained peatland
   and permafrost ecosystems. Landscape composition, then, is important for
   scaling carbon storage in boreal regions. However, whether the
   configuration of upland and lowland ecosystems influences carbon
   processes has not been adequately explored but likely is important to
   variations in carbon emissions during fire. Biological controls such as
   herbivory and insect outbreaks are important to the distribution of
   plant species and nitrogen availability in forest ecosystems, but their
   influence on wetland systems or long-term carbon dynamics is not well
   understood.}},

Abstract = {{North American prairie vegetation has been a role model for designing
   highly attractive plantings for German urban green spaces for the past
   decade. In combination with gravel mulch top layers on planting sites
   and non-selective maintenance techniques like mowing or burning, prairie
   plantings are considered to be cost-effective and low-maintenance. This
   study was undertaken to assess the impact of different maintenance
   strategies and especially the necessity of fire management on the
   development success of ornamental prairie plantings in central Europe. A
   four factorial split-plot-block design was set up for investigation of
   different mixtures of prairie species under varying management
   conditions (mow-only, mowing plus selective weeding, mowing plus weeding
   and burning) on two differing soil types (in-situ topsoil and in-situ
   topsoil with a graywacke gravel mulch top layer) over three years.
   Significant effects of maintenance strategy on mortality rates and
   vitality were documented for a number of target species, which responded
   species specifically, either being slightly affected by the burning or
   thriving on it. Those effects were mostly restricted to topsoil sites. A
   strong impact on weed species presence and abundance and resulting
   maintenance times was found on both soil types. On topsoil sites,
   mow-only treatment resulted in a short-term loss of the original
   planting due to extensive weed growth. Corresponding gravel mulch sites
   were generally less colonised and visually dominated by weeds.
   Differences between weeded and weeded plus burned sites were minor.
   Unexpectedly, weed species populations were mostly unaffected by the
   additional burning treatment, while maintenance times and costs
   increased. No overall benefit of fire management for the establishment
   of prairie plantings was documented. The most effective management
   combination proved to be mowing plus regular selective weeding measures
   on gravel mulched planting sites.}},

   Wyoming) and the Snake River drainage (Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and
   probably Washington). Individual populations evolved distinct life
   history characteristics in response to the diverse environments in which
   they were isolated after the last glaciation. Anthropogenic activities
   have resulted in a substantial decline (42\% of the historical range is
   currently occupied; 28\% is occupied by core {[}genetically unaltered]
   populations), but the number of extant populations, especially in
   headwater streams, has precluded listing of this taxon under the
   Endangered Species Act. Primary threats to persistence of Yellowstone
   cutthroat trout include (1) invasive species, resulting in
   hybridization, predation, disease, and interspecific competition; (2)
   habitat degradation from human activities such as agricultural
   practices, water diversions, grazing, dam construction, mineral
   extraction, grazing, timber harvest, and road construction; and (3)
   climate change, including an escalating risk of drought, wildfire,
   winter flooding, and rising temperatures. Extirpation of individual
   populations or assemblages has led to increasing isolation and
   fragmentation of remaining groups, which in turn raises susceptibility
   to the demographic influences of disturbance (both human and stochastic)
   and genetic factors. Primary conservation strategies include (1)
   preventing risks associated with invasive species by isolating
   populations of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and (2) connecting occupied
   habitats (where possible) to preserve metapopulation function and the
   expression of multiple life histories. Because persistence of isolated
   populations may be greater in the short term, current management is
   focused on isolating individual populations and restoring habitats;
   however, this approach implies that humans will act as dispersal agents
   if a population is extirpated because of stochastic events.}},

Abstract = {{A key land management goal for the Tall Timbers Research Station
   property (1585 ha) is to maintain upland pine-dominated habitats with
   frequent (one- to three-year) low-intensity prescribed fires to provide
   habitat for characteristic native animals, particularly the Northern
   Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). Currently, loblolly and shortleaf pine
   (Pinus taeda and P. echinata), are common in the uplands, but the
   presence of scattered longleaf pine (P. palustris) suggest that this
   species was once more common. Dominance of fire-intolerant pines on
   upland sites has led to a land management dilemma: short fire return
   intervals (1-3 years) are needed to control hardwoods in the understory,
   but it kills seedling and sapling loblolly and shortleaf pines. Low
   levels of pine regeneration has created an age structure dominated by
   older age classes, and a steadily increasing hardwood component. For
   ecological and economic reasons, we have initiated a project to reduce
   hardwood dominance on upland habitats on 480 hectares of Tall Timbers.
   Management actions include a timber harvest to remove merchantable
   hardwoods and combinations of drum chopping, mowing and herbicide
   treatment. Longleaf pine is being planted as part of experiments testing
   different methods of restoration. Response of songbird, Northern
   Bobwhite, Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperi) populations and ground cover
   vegetation will be monitored before and after hardwood removal.}},

Abstract = {{Transhumance is a resource efficient means of livestock production by
   seasonally moving grazing animals to utilize pastures between varying
   ecological zones. This article investigated the interrelationship
   between the environmental services the transhumant provides whilst
   maintaining its cultural heritage and theorized what the cultural and
   environmental impacts would be if the practice of transhumance were to
   vanish. The authors interviewed 45 transhumant families during their
   2015 seasonal migration through the Taurus Mountains and in their
   settled tent sites in Central Anatolia. The interview topics related to
   geography of the region, migration routes, natural resource constraints
   and opportunities, animal husbandry, grazing strategies and their income
   sources. By practicing agro-ecological principles over millennia, the
   research showed that the transhumant has helped shape a complex mosaic
   of habitats in one of Mediterranean's most interesting ecosystems. The
   mobile pastoralist with conservation and natural resource management
   skills over a long period has reduced erosion control, improved soil
   quality and deterred the likelihood of forest fires, whilst weaving a
   resilient social web. The survey also indicated a clear link between
   social and ecological resilience emphasizing that sustainable
   development relies on the interconnectedness between biological and
   cultural diversity. The study recommends special provisions be made by
   the Turkish government for the educational needs for the children of the
   transhumant, provide initiatives for improved trading of their produce,
   introduce law enforcement for oppressive behavior against them and
   finally support the pastoralists to attain world heritage listing as a
   unique and an irreplaceable culture for the future welfare of humankind.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The concurrent discussions of landscape scale restoration among
   restoration ecologists, and of historic disturbance pattern as a
   guideline for forest management among forest scientists, offer a unique
   opportunity for collaboration between these traditionally separated
   fields. The objective of this study was to review the environmental
   history, early restoration projects, and current plans to restore
   landscape patterns at broader scales in the 450,000 ha northwest
   Wisconsin Pine Barrens. The Pine Barrens offer an example of a landscape
   shaped by fire in the past. In northwestern Wisconsin historically the
   barrens were a mosaic of open prairie, savanna, and pine forests on very
   poor, sandy soils. The surrounding region of better soils was otherwise
   heavily forested. Six restoration sites have been managed since the
   middle of this century using prescribed burns to maintain the open,
   barrens habitat. However, these sites are not extensive enough to mimic
   the shifting mosaic of large open patches previously created by fire.
   Extensive clear-cuts may be used as a substitute for these large fire
   patches so that presettlement landscape patterns are more closely
   approximated in the current landscape. We suggest that such
   silvicultural treatments can be suitable to restore certain aspects of
   presettlement landscapes, such as landscape pattern and open habitat for
   species such as grassland birds. We are aware that the effects of fire
   and clear-cuts differ in many aspects and additional management tools,
   such as prescribed burning after harvesting, may assist in further
   approximating the effect of natural disturbance. However, the
   restoration of landscape pattern using clear-cuts may provide an
   important context for smaller isolated restoration sites even without
   the subsequent application of fire, in this formerly more open
   landscape.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the effect of elevation and aspect on fire return intervals
   in the Canadian Rocky Mountains}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{384}},
Pages = {{248-261}},

Abstract = {{The effect of topography on wildfire distribution in the Canadian
   Rockies has been the subject of debate. We suspect the size of the study
   area, and the assumption fire return intervals are distributed as a
   Weibull distribution used in many previous studies may have obscured the
   real effect of topography on these fire-regulated ecosystems. The
   objective of this study was to quantify the effects of elevation,
   aspect, slope and dominant species on probabilities of burning. The
   study area covered three natural subregions: Subalpine, Montane, and
   Upper Foothills of the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada. Fire
   return interval (FRI) data from 870 fire history sampling sites were
   stratified by subregion and analyzed with the non-parametric
   Kaplan-Meier survival model and Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) regression
   model for survival data. The natural subregions were found to have
   distinct FRI distributions. The Kaplan-Meier probability median
   historical (pre-1948) FRI values ranged from 26 to 35 years for the
   Montane, was 39 years for the Upper Foothills and ranged between 65 and
   85 years for the Subalpine. Within each subregion elevation was the lead
   predictor variable influencing probabilities of burning, and its
   significant PH ratio indicated the effect of elevation was maintained
   through time. For every 100 m of increased elevation, the probability of
   burning decreased by 12\%, 21\% and 33\% for the Montane, Upper
   Foothills and Subalpine, respectively. Aspect was only significant in
   the Subalpine with a PH ratio indicating warm aspects are twice as
   likely (105\%) to burn than cool aspects. The combined topographic
   elements of high elevation and cool aspect produce the longest FRIs and
   are where fire refugia (old growth) tend to form. A salient finding of
   our study was the multiplicative effect that cool aspect has on burning
   probabilities of forests located at low or high elevation, as well as
   the interchangeable effect of some topographic combinations in the
   Subalpine. Our findings do not support the established assumptions from
   previous studies that the Little Ice Age was responsible for a change in
   the burning rate, nor that probabilities of burning are spatially
   homogeneous in mountain landscapes. The combined effect of aspect and
   elevation on FRIs need to be integrated when writing fire prescriptions
   for ecological restoration, and be part of adaptive forest management
   strategies working towards maintaining fire refugia patches. Timber
   managers aiming to emulate natural disturbances will also need to
   consider the effect of topography when planning seral stage
   distributions in mountainous landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Mountain systems are often recognised as biodiversity hotspots; however,
   most montane forests are human-modified. Understanding the conservation
   value of human-modified forests is essential to mountain biodiversity
   conservation. In this study, mist-nets and point-counts were used to
   compare the bird communities of primary forests on ridges in the Ailao
   Mountains of Yunnan, China, and secondary forests, firewood forests, and
   pine plantations in nearby lower elevation zones. We found that
   community turnover among habitats was very high using both methods.
   Although the percentage of forest interior species and insectivores in
   each habitat was higher in the primary forests than in the
   human-modified forests, relatively high percentages of forest interior
   species and insectivores were recorded in the human-modified forests.
   Moreover, many bird species, forest interior species, insectivores and
   babblers were only recorded in the human-modified forests. Our study
   indicated that the primary forests are important for sustaining mountain
   bird diversity. However, given that primary forests are restricted to
   ridges, secondary forests, firewood forests, and pine plantations at
   lower elevations also play important roles in bird conservation in
   mountainous regions by increasing landscape diversity and partially
   offsetting species loss from primary forests. Therefore, conservation
   efforts should also be concentrated on human-modified forests at lower

Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Polychlorinated dibenzo-P-dioxins (PCDDs), commonly known as dioxins,
   form as unwanted impurities in the manufacturing of chlorophenol and its
   derivatives-pulp and paper-and in the combustion of municipal,
   sewage-sludge, hospital, and hazardous waste. Combustion, in presence of
   a chlorine donor, seems to be a major source of these compounds. High
   levels of dioxins are also emitted from metallurgical industries
   including copper smelters, electric furnaces in steel mills, and wire
   reclamation incinerators. Trace levels are detectable in emissions from
   motor vehicles using leaded gasoline or diesel fuel, in forest fires,
   and in residential wood burning.
   Extremely persistent and widely distributed in the environment, PCDDs
   have been detected in all three primary and many secondary media.
   Releases into the air occur mainly from combustor emissions. Atmospheric
   dispersion, deposition, and subsequent accumulation in the food chain
   seem to be the major pathways of exposure to the general population.
   Residues of these chemicals have been detected in soil, sediment, fish,
   meat, cow's milk, human adipose tissue, and mothers' milk. In general,
   these chemicals have high lipophilicity. The elimination half-life of
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in humans is approximately
   7-11 years.
   Very little human toxicity data from exposure to PCDDs are available.
   Health-effect data obtained from occupational settings in humans are
   based on exposure to chemicals contaminated with TCDD. It produces a
   spectrum of toxic effects in animals and is one of the most toxic
   chemicals known. Most of the toxicity data available on TCDD are from
   high-dose oral exposures to animals. Very few percutaneous and no
   inhalation exposure data are available in the literature. There is a
   wide range of difference in sensitivity to PCDD lethality in animals.
   The signs and symptoms of poisoning with chemicals contaminated with
   TCDD in humans are analogous to those observed in animals. Dioxin
   exposures to humans are associated with increased risk of severe skin
   lesions such as chloracne and hyperpigmentation, altered liver function
   and lipid metabolism, general weakness associated with drastic weight
   loss, changes in activities of various liver enzymes, depression of the
   immune system, and endocrine-and nervous-system abnormalities. It is a
   potent teratogenic and fetotoxic chemical in animals. A very potent
   promoter in rat Liver carcinogenesis, TCDD also causes cancers of the
   liver and other organs in animals. Populations occupationally or
   accidentally exposed to chemicals contaminated with dioxin have
   increased incidences of soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   No comprehensive studies have been conducted to determine any health
   impact to the general population from environmental exposure to PCDDs.
   This paper presents a brief review of relevant animal and human data for
   projecting any possible health effects from environmental exposures to
   PCDDs.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{384}},
Pages = {{287-302}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Robinia pseudoacacia, invaded many countries a long time ago and is now
   a common part of the Central European landscape. Positive economic but
   negative environmental impacts of Robinia result in conflicts of
   interest between nature conservation, forestry, urban landscaping,
   beekeepers and the public when defining management priorities. Because
   current legislation will determine the future distribution of Robinia in
   the landscape, a comprehensive view of this species is necessary.
   Although this species is well studied, most of the scientific papers
   deal with the economic aspects. Other information is published in local
   journals or reports. Therefore we reviewed the ecological and
   socio-economic impact of Robinia placing particular emphasis on the
   species' history, vegetation ecology, invasiveness and management. In
   Central Europe, Robinia is limited climatically by late spring frost
   combined with a short vegetation period, soil hypoxia, shade and
   frequent major disturbances. The long historical tradition of using
   Robinia for afforestation has resulted in its popularity as a widespread
   forest tree and it being an important part of the economy in some
   countries. The main reasons are its fast growth, valuable and resistant
   wood, suitability for amelioration, reclamation of disturbed sites and
   erosion control, honey-making and recently dendromass production. On the
   other hand, a side-effect of planting this nitrogen-fixing pioneer tree,
   very tolerant of the nature of the substrate, is its propagation and
   spread, which pose a problem for nature conservation. Robinia is
   considered invasive, threatening especially dry and semi-dry grasslands,
   some of the most species-rich and endangered types of habitat in the
   region, causing extinction of many endangered light-demanding plants and
   invertebrates due to changes in light regime, microclimate and soil
   conditions. Other often invaded habitats include open dry forests and
   shrubland, alluvial habitats, agrarian landscapes, urban and industrial
   environments and disturbed sites, e.g. post-fire sites, forest clearings
   or degraded forestry plantations. Without forestry, black locust
   abundance would decrease during succession in forests with highly
   competitive and shade tolerant trees and in mature forests it occurs
   only as admixture of climax trees. The limited pool of native woody
   species, lack of serious natural enemies and a dense cover of grasses
   and sedges can suppress forest succession and favour the development of
   Robinia monodominant stands over 70 years old. A stratified approach,
   which combines both tolerance in some areas and strict eradication at
   valuable sites, provides the best option for achieving a sustainable
   coexistence of Robinia with people and nature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{407}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Lower-value biomass (LVB) in forests constitutes non-commercial material
   traditionally left on site following harvesting. Emerging markets for
   energy and bioproducts have increased incentives to harvest and utilize
   this material in some cases. Removal of LVB can reduce forest health
   risks stemming from wildfire, diseases, and pests but has raised
   questions about effects on forest productivity and environmental
   sustainability. The status, trends, and quantities of forest biomass are
   most often estimated from forest inventories but socioeconomic and
   physical factors limit the quantity of residual biomass available for
   use. National forest inventory data suggest quantities of LVB are likely
   substantial, with annual timberland growth exceeding harvest removals in
   all states where data are available and unutilized dead biomass roughly
   half that of current harvest removals. Cost-effective transport distance
   and logistical factors limit the practical availability of LVB, with
   in-woods chipping as part of conventional harvesting operations
   generally providing the greatest economic returns. Harvesting LVB
   removes higher quantities of nutrients from forested sites with greater
   potential impact on soil physical properties, soil carbon, and forest
   productivity than traditional, stem-only harvesting. However, global
   assessments show inconsistent forest productivity and soil responses and
   impacts across contrasting sites and soil types. Lower residue retention
   and changes in forest structure resulting from LVB harvesting can also
   influence habitat for some wildlife species. Some field studies suggest
   removals of downed coarse woody debris negatively impact bird diversity
   and abundance while other assessments suggest minimal or only temporary
   effects with benefits to other species, particularly those associated
   with early seral habitat. While LVB harvesting and residue removal have
   the potential to increase soil disturbance and delivery of sediment and
   nutrients to streams compared to traditional harvesting, best management
   practices demonstrated effective in protecting water quality through
   decades of field research should be largely applicable to practices that
   include LVB harvesting. Although states and other entities have
   developed biomass harvesting guidelines and revised certification
   standards that restrict or modify intensive harvesting practices, the
   efficacy of such guidelines is uncertain due to highly variable site
   limitations and responses and a lack of site-specific response data.
   This paper provides an overview of environmental implications and
   practical considerations related to harvesting LVB in forests and how
   they differ from harvesting of traditional, commercial biomass sources.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{574-581}},
Abstract = {{Context. Fallen timber is a key habitat feature in forests and woodlands
   for vertebrate and invertebrate fauna, and is either consumed or left
   partially burnt after the passage of fire. This impact on habitat
   quality assumes significance because increasing areas of land are
   subject to frequent hazard-reduction burning and wildfire in eastern
   Australia.
   Aims. We test here whether partially burnt or charred fallen timber is
   employed as habitat to the same extent as unburnt fallen timber.
   Methods. Vertebrate and invertebrate abundance beneath burnt and unburnt
   fence posts was monitored for 13 months in unburnt forest and forest
   burnt by a wildfire.
   Key results. Both vertebrate and invertebrate fauna made significantly
   less use of charred refuges. In most taxa, twice as many animals
   occurred under unburnt as under burnt artificial timber refuges, ant
   nests being the exception. Fauna made greater use of experimental
   refuges in burnt forest.
   Key conclusions. Partially burnt fallen-timber refuges, where the log
   surface is left charred, are inferior habitat for fauna. Habitat quality
   in burnt forest may be enhanced by introducing fallen timber.
   Implications. The study highlights an ecological consequence of fire for
   habitat quality, whether through wildfire or hazard-reduction burning,
   which should be considered in fire management.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{355-359}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to learn more about the potential for reintroduction of
   hare-wallabies to sites in Australia, 34 captive-bred hare-wallabies
   were released onto Peron Peninsula within the Shark Bay World Heritage
   Property in 2001 as part of an experimental reintroduction program. One
   objective of this experiment was to characterise their behaviour and
   daytime refugia to identify suitable habitat for future releases. The
   mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and merrnine (Lagostrophus fasciatus) were
   fitted with radio-transmitters and tracked daily. Merrnine were more
   faithful to a previously occupied shelter than mala. Mala maintained a
   solitary daytime habit at all times. Within the study area, mala
   preferentially sought low-lying vegetation primarily comprising the
   species Lamarchea hakeifolia, which provided dense cover up to 1 m in
   height, under which they constructed scrapes. L. hakeifolia was
   preferred as shelter vegetation instead of Triodia (spinifex) hummocks,
   despite Triodia hummock habitat being preferred by mala in central
   Australia. Merrnine occupied taller vegetation with an open understorey
   to 1.5 m, although the extremity of the understorey remained dense at
   this height. Individual merrnine sometimes sheltered with conspecifics
   of the opposite sex. Since both species utilised floristically and
   structurally variable vegetation, we suggest that they have the ability
   to cope with vegetation that has been altered by changes in fire regimes
   and introduced herbivores. This is particularly important for future
   reintroduction exercises as the results suggest that vegetation

Abstract = {{Erosion and sedimentation are natural geomorphic processes characterized
   by large temporal and spatial variability. Episodic events, particularly
   wildfire, appear to dominate long-term sediment yields. Early studies
   documented the effects of grazing and wildfire on erosion and sediment
   yields. Effects of harvesting and associated site preparation activities
   on surface erosion are generally minimal and usually controlled by
   providing downslope buffers. Roads consistently have been shown to have
   the greatest effect on both surface and mass erosion of all the
   practices associated with forest management. However, a large body of
   research shows that much of the erosional impacts of roads are
   manageable through proper land use planning, location, design,
   construction, maintenance, and closure (Best Management Practices).
   Several models, both empirical and process-based, have been developed to
   predict surface erosion rates, the effectiveness of a variety of erosion
   control practices, and downslope sediment delivery. Examples of
   downstream cumulative effects have been documented in terms of sediment
   delivery and associated channel responses. However, methods to predict
   downstream cumulative effects are crude, limited primarily to sediment
   delivery, and more applicable to smaller basins. The linkages between
   downstream cumulative effects and the impacts on beneficial uses,
   especially fish habitat, are poorly defined.}},

Abstract = {{Summer burning was used to reduce spittlebug (Aeneolamia albofasciata
   Lall.) populations in buffelgrass {[}Cenchrus ciliaris (L.) Link] on the
   Carbo Livestock Research Station in Sonora, Mexico. Five treatments
   included (1) an untreated control; (2) burning 7-14 days before the
   summer rains when the insect and the plant were inactive; (3) burning
   after the accumulation of 50 mm of summer precipitation during insect
   egg hatch or the second leaf stage; (4) burning between the second and
   third instars or early culm elongation; (5) and burning between the
   fifth instar and adult stages or active plant growth during the summer
   growing season. Summer burning after the accumulation of 50 mm of
   precipitation and between the egg hatch and the third instars or between
   the second leaf stage and early culm elongation reduced spittlebug nymph
   and adult populations by 100\% and appeared to stimulate buffelgrass
   growth for 3 and 4 years post treatment. Burning at the peak of
   buffelgrass live biomass production effectively controlled spittlebug
   populations but reduced plant production by almost 50\% for 4 years
   post-treatment. Equally detrimental was the untreated control where
   nymph and adult spittlebug populations killed more than 50\% of the
   buffelgrass population. Summer fires conducted after 50 mm of
   precipitation were easier to control than fires conducted before the
   growing season when plant material was dry.}},

Volume = {{75}},

Pages = {{174-179}},
Abstract = {{The effects on amphibians of forest insects, tree diseases, wildfire,
   and management strategies designed to improve forest health (e.g.,
   thinning, prescribed burns, road removal, and spraying with pesticides
   or biological microbial agents) are discussed. Those species that occur
   in forested habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington that are
   considered of concern include the Oregon spotted frog (Rana pretiosa),
   Columbia spotted frog (R. luteiventris), northern leopard frog (R.
   pipiens), Cascades frog (R. cascadae), tailed frog (Ascaphas truei),
   Larch Mountain salamander (Plethodon larselli), and Cope's giant
   salamander (Dicamptodon copei). Little is known regarding the effects of
   forest health on amphibians, although tree mortality resulting from
   insects and disease is unlikely to dramatically affect these species,
   except for the tailed frog and larch mountain salamander. Both these
   species depend on overstory canopy to maintain temperature and moisture
   conditions; timber harvest in their habitats has rendered them
   unsuitable. Wildfire and prescribed burning to a lesser extent, may
   alter the abundance of prey, coarse woody debris, and vegetation, which
   could influence movements and survival of dispersing amphibians.
   Spraying with pesticides could negatively affect these species if the
   abundance of their prey is decreased. Spraying with biological microbial
   agents is unlikely to affect prey abundance. Additional research is
   needed to determine if these disturbance agents are contributing to the
   decline of many of these amphibians.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Following the extensive 1988 fires in Yellowstone, a mosaic of
   high-density patches of fallen logs and regenerating lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.) saplings developed in
   the landscape. Such patches could potentially provide browsing refugia
   for post-fire aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) seedlings. We asked two
   primary research questions: (1) Do elk (Cervus elaphus L.) reduce their
   use of highdensity patches of coarse-wood and pine saplings? and (2) Are
   the abundance, height, and probability of presence of aspen positively
   related to the density of coarse wood or pine saplings? We visited 65
   sites distributed across density gradients of downed wood and
   regenerating saplings. At each site, aspen seedlings were counted along
   five 50 m x 2 m belt transects. The height, basal diameter and presence
   of browse damage were recorded for each individual. Fallen logs and elk
   fecal pellet groups were counted along the same transects. Aspen
   seedlings were heavily browsed throughout the study area and were less
   likely to be found near high-elevation meadows. Variation in elk pellet
   densities was not explained by the density of logs at the scale of the
   transect or the site. The height of aspen seedlings was not related to
   density of logs, pine saplings or elk fecal pellet groups. However,
   taller aspen were found at higher elevations and with more open meadow
   in the landscape. This suggests that later snowmelt and alternative
   forage may reduce browsing pressure on aspen. Given that some of the
   sites had densities of pine saplings in excess of 60,000 stems ha(-1)
   and densities of downed logs greater than 2000 logs ha(-1), these
   results suggest that fire-induced coarse wood and pine saplings will not
   create broad-scale browsing refugia for aspen in the landscape of the
   Yellowstone plateau. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Complex habitat drives mammal communities in a flammable landscape}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{462}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{In flammable ecosystems biodiversity can be influenced by multiple
   drivers, and conservation management requires knowledge of their
   relative influence. For example, land managers often manipulate fire
   regimes to increase environmental heterogeneity and promote
   biodiversity. However, the influence of fire relative to other drivers
   of biodiversity is often unknown. In this study, we used a temporally
   replicated dataset to (a) examine the effect of climate, topography,
   time since fire and habitat structure on mammal alpha- and
   beta-diversity and (b) assess the consistency of these responses through
   time. We surveyed ground-dwelling mammals within the Otway Ranges of
   Australia over four periods between 2010 and 2017. Alpha- and
   beta-diversity were most strongly influenced by habitat complexity.
   Alpha-diversity showed a strong positive relationship with habitat
   complexity, while there was a constant change in beta-diversity along
   the habitat complexity gradient. The remaining drivers, particularly
   time since fire, had relatively low influence. Alpha- and beta-diversity
   were often influenced by different environmental variables, emphasising
   the value of assessing multiple levels of species diversity. Finally,
   each survey period predicted the observed data in other years poorly,
   reflecting temporal change in response patterns, and demonstrating
   multiple years of data may be needed to characterise the response of
   species diversity to potential drivers. Overall, our results show
   environmental variables - particularly habitat structure - are more
   influential than time since fire in driving species diversity. Land
   managers seeking to manage species diversity may do so indirectly,
   through the influence of fire on habitat complexity. However, to do so
   effectively requires greater understanding of how fire interacts with
   other factors to influence floristics and vegetation recovery.}},

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2537-2547}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The pre-historical vegetation structure in temperate forest regions is
   much debated among European and North American ecologists and
   conservationists. Frans Vera's recent hypothesis that large mammals
   created mosaics of forest and openland vegetation in both regions
   throughout the Holocene has been particularly controversial and has
   provoked new approaches to conservation management. Thirty years
   earlier, American paleoecologists Herb Wright and Margaret Davis debated
   whether abundant ragweed pollen at Rogers Lake, Connecticut at 9500 yr
   BP signified local forest openings or long-distance transport of pollen
   from Midwestern prairies. Using new pollen records from Harvard Forest
   and the North American Pollen Database, we address this question and
   offer insights to the openland discussion. Ragweed and other forbs
   exceed 3.5\% at five sites in a restricted area of southern New England
   between 10 100 and 7700 yr BP. Strong evidence suggests this pollen
   originated from the landscapes surrounding these sites (supporting
   Davis), as ragweed pollen percentages do not increase with longitude
   from New England to the Midwest. Ragweed pollen percentages are also
   unrelated to basin size and therefore unrelated to the proportion of
   extraregional pollen in New England. High forbs values were associated
   with increases in oak, decreases in white pine, and relatively high
   charcoal values. Modern pollen records with similar forb and tree
   percentages occur along the Prairie Peninsula region of the Upper
   Midwest. However, the closest analogue to the southern New England early
   Holocene assemblages comes from Massachusetts' Walden Pond in the early
   18th century. These results and the affiliation of ragweed for open,
   disturbed habitats suggest that oak-pine forests with large openings
   persisted for over 2000 years due to dry conditions and perhaps
   increased fire frequency. This conclusion is corroborated by independent
   lake level and climate reconstructions. Because these early Holocene
   openlands have no detectable analogue in New England for the past 7000
   years before European settlement, we suggest that all important
   openlands today are almost exclusively a legacy of Colonial agriculture
   and should be managed accordingly. Nonetheless, our results may have
   implications for forest dynamics accompanying projected climate change
   to more and conditions in New England over the next century.}},

Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) forests in northern
   Arizona have degraded due to overgrazing, logging, and fire suppression
   that accompanied Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s. Overstocked
   stands of suppressed trees with low structural diversity dominate the
   landscape. These conditions create high risk of catastrophic fires and
   insect outbreaks. We investigated long-term effects (8-16 years
   post-treatment) of thinning and thinning + prescribed burning on
   ponderosa pine water stress, leaf carbon isotope discrimination and
   nitrogen concentration, oleoresin exudation flow, phloem, thickness,
   radial growth, and bark beetle abundance relative to unmanaged control
   stands over 2 years of measurement in 12 stands replicated across the
   landscape. Predawn water potential in late June, phloem thickness, and
   basal area increment were lower in unmanaged than managed stands.
   Oleoresin exudation flow in July was greater in unmanaged and thinned +
   burned stands than thinned stands, and greater in a warm year than a
   cooler year. Leaf nitrogen concentration differed between years, but not
   among treatments. Tree competition and water stress were positively
   correlated, and tree competition was negatively correlated with radial
   growth and phloem thickness. Pheromone-baited trap catches of
   Dendroctonus spp. (D. brevicomis Leconte pooled with D. frontalis
   Zimmerman) were higher in unmanaged than managed stands, whereas catches
   of Ips spp. did not differ among treatments. We conclude that thinning
   with and without prescribed burning can have long-term effects on
   ponderosa pine water stress, growth, phloem thickness, resin flow, and
   bark beetle abundance. Low levels of tree mortality from bark beetles at
   our study sites suggest remarkable resistance of ponderosa pine in
   mid-elevation forests in northern Arizona, even at high tree densities.

Abstract = {{In remote areas, wild-fires often must be controlled by applying
   fire-retardants and suppressants dropped from small aircraft. However,
   impacts of these chemicals on natural stream ecosystems are poorly
   known. Unintentional aerial application of fire-fighting chemicals
   (Phos-Chek WD-881 and ForExspan S) onto two small streams during a
   natural wildfire on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, provided an
   opportunity to study the short-term effects on water chemistry and
   aquatic invertebrates. Within 2 weeks of application, samples of water
   and macroinvertebrates were collected from sites upstream of the
   application point, within the zone of application, and downstream where
   burning had been controlled on two streams. Three sites on a reference
   stream in the same sub-catchment that had been burned by the same fire
   but without application of fire-suppressants were also sampled. All
   sites were resampled three months later (within two weeks of the first
   flushing rains). There were no marked differences in water quality among
   the sites on the reference stream but in one of the impacted streams
   where flow had ceased before the fire, dissolved and total phosphorus
   concentrations were elevated at the site where the fire-suppressants
   were applied. Phosphorus concentrations were reduced 2-3-fold at this
   site after brief flushing by rain. Conversely, dissolved and total N and
   P concentrations at the other impacted stream that flowed permanently
   did not differ among the sites and there was no evidence for persistent
   changes to water quality from the applied fire-suppressant foams. Taxon
   richness was higher at the application and downstream sites than at
   upstream sites in the two impacted streams. There were also no
   discernible effects of the fire-suppressants on macroinvertebrate
   assemblage composition or taxon richness within the two streams two
   weeks after the chemical application or soon after flushing rains.
   Assemblage composition in the temporary stream was significantly
   different from that in the reference and the other impacted stream but
   also appeared unaffected by the fire-suppressants. The lack of impact on
   resident stream macroinvertebrates may result partly from their inherent
   high tolerance to the harsh physical and chemical conditions of these
   streams, many of which typically cease flow in summer.}},

   individuals (0.8 vs. 3 fledglings respectively), mostly due to

   mortalities of at least four nestlings. Fostering captive-bred nestlings
   to the wild showed some potential as a recovery tool, with 2 of 4 nests

Abstract = {{We analyzed long-term (23 years) data of inorganic N deposition and loss
   for an extensive network of mature mixed hardwood covered watersheds in
   the southern Appalachians of North Carolina to assess trends and
   dynamics of N in baseline ecosystems, We also assessed watershed N
   saturation in the context of altered N cycles and stream inorganic N
   responses associated with management practices (cutting prescriptions,
   species replacement, and prescribed burning) and with natural
   disturbances (drought and wet years, insect infestations, hurricane
   damage, and ozone events) on reference watersheds. Reference watersheds
   were characterized as highly conservative of inorganic N with deposition
   < 9.0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and stream water exports below 0.25 kg ha(-1)
   yr(-1). However, reference watersheds appeared to be in a transition
   phase between stage 0 and stage 1 of watershed N saturation as evidenced
   by significant time trend increases in annual flow-weighted
   concentrations of NO3- in stream water and increases in the seasonal
   amplitude and duration of NO3 concentrations during 1972-1994. These
   stream water chemistry trends were partially attributed to significant
   increases in NO3- and NH4+ concentrations in bulk precipitation over the
   same period and/or reduced biological demand due to forest maturation.
   Levels and annual patterns of stream NO3- concentrations and
   intra-annual seasonal patterns characteristic of latter phases of stages
   1 and 2 of watershed N saturation were found for low-elevation and
   high-elevation clear-cut watersheds, respectively, and were related to
   the dynamics of microbial transformations of N and vegetation uptake.
   Evidence for stage 3 of N saturation, where the watershed is a net
   source of N rather than a N sink, was found for the most distributed
   watershed at Coweeta (hardwood converted to grass, fertilized,limed,
   treated with herbicide, and subsequently characterized by successional
   vegetation). Compared to other intensive management practices,
   prescribed burning had little effect on stream water NO3-

   and die-offs from 1974 to 1983. Similar declines were noted in Sonora,
   Mexico; however, the species still persists at many sites in Mexico.
   Chytridiomycosis was detected during some declines and implicated in
   others; however, airborne pollutants from copper smelters, predation,
   competition, and extreme weather may have also been contributing
   factors. We collected Tarahumara Frogs in Sonora for captive rearing and
   propagation beginning in 1999, and released frogs to two historical
   localities in Arizona, including Big Casa Blanca Canyon and vicinity,
   Santa Rita Mountains, and Sycamore Canyon, Atascosa Mountains. Releases
   in the Big Casa Blanca Canyon area began in 2004 and frogs prospered and
   reproduced there initially but were much reduced in numbers by late 2007
   after post-fire flooding and sedimentation of breeding pools and
   chytridiomycosis die-offs. We released additional frogs during
   2012-2015, and small numbers of Tarahumara Frogs have continued to
   persist at this site and an adjacent drainage through 2019. At Sycamore
   Canyon, we began releases of Tarahumara Frog in 2014, and small numbers
   have persisted into 2019 in a tributary canyon. We also established a
   population in 2002 at Kofa National Wildlife Refuge in western Arizona
   as a refugium and source of animals for reintroduction. As of 2019, it
   still persists as a robust breeding population. We discuss our methods
   for reintroducing Tarahumara Frogs, problems, adaptive management, and
   future options for reintroduction of this species into Arizona.}},
