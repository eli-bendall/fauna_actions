Abstract = {{Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) has been characterized as a ``burn
   specialist{''} because of its preference for nesting within burned pine
   forests. No prior study, however, has demonstrated the relative
   importance of crown-burned forests to this woodpecker species by
   examining its reproductive success in different forest types. We studied
   breeding Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) riparian
   forest patches of Colorado and crown-burned ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests of Idaho to compare their reproductive success,
   productivity, and potential source-sink status in the two forest types.
   Daily nest survival rates were significantly lower in cottonwood
   compared to burned pine forests. Nesting success was 46\% (n=65) in
   cottonwood forests and 78\% (n=283) in burned pine forests. Proportion
   of nests destroyed by predators was significantly higher in cottonwood
   forests (34\%) compared to burned pine forests (16\%). We consistently
   found crown-burned forests to be potential source habitat, whereas
   cottonwood riparian sites were more often concluded to be potential sink
   habitat. Cottonwood riparian forests were Surrounded primarily by an
   agricultural landscape where the composition and abundance of nest
   predators was likely very different than the predator assemblage
   occupying a large-scale burn in a relatively natural landscape.
   Conversion of riparian and adjacent grassland landscapes to agriculture
   and prevention of wildfire in ponderosa pine forests have likely reduced
   nesting habitat for this species. Prescribed understory fire is the
   prevailing management tool for restoring ponderosa pine ecosystems.
   Conditions created by crown fire may be equally important in maintaining
   ponderosa pine systems and conserving nesting habitat for the Lewis's
   Woodpecker.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a common disturbance in the Mediterranean ecosystem. A fire that
   broke out in the eastern Mediterranean pine forest on Mount Carmel in
   September 1989 destroyed thousands of hectares of natural forest. We
   carried out a comparative study of rodent recovery after fire under
   three different management regimes in order to establish the best
   treatment for recovery. Rodents were used as `bio-indicators', because
   of their limited home range, to assess the best management practice to
   be used in the recovery of the post-fire habitat. Our results show that
   the three arboreal Palaeoarctic species which lived in this habitat
   before the fire either died during the fire or left the habitat as a
   result of its destruction. A succession of rodent species was observed.
   The untreated burned forest had the highest species diversity in the
   initial stage, while during a later stage the highest diversity was
   observed in plots where the burned trees were cut down, the trunks
   removed and the twigs collected into small piles. The results also
   suggest that removing the trunks and twigs at the initial stage of
   recolonization results in a more xeric and warm habitat which will
   postpone the reinvasion of the forest species.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands and open savannas are transitioning to shrub-dominated or
   tree-dominated landscapes. This phenomenon, often referred to as woody
   plant encroachment, is occurring globally. The outcomes of interactions
   among the various drivers of this change differ biogeographically; in
   semi-arid and subhumid regions they are often related to grazing-induced
   changes in fire regimes. Two important theoretical and conceptual
   frameworks are emerging that help us understand the underlying
   mechanisms of these transformations and inform approaches for
   maintaining and restoring grasslands and open savannas: alternative
   stable state theory (ASST) and pyric herbivory. Alternative stable state
   theory is a way of explaining, understanding, and predicting ecosystem
   state transitions in dual-life-form systems, and pyric herbivory is
   built on the notion that reciprocal, spatially distributed interactions
   between grazing and fire are a key to maintaining grassland and open
   savanna landscapes. Considered in tandem, ASST provides insights into
   rates and dynamics of grasswoody vegetation transitions, with pyric
   herbivory providing a conceptual basis for designing sustainable,
   site-specific management strategies. Future progress will hinge on
   experimental evaluations of these linked frameworks and their subsequent
   refinement over longer time frames in an adaptive management context.}},

Abstract = {{Although belowground biomass patterns are important in understanding
   aboveground responses, few studies have quantified how belowground
   biomass changes in response to fire cycles. In this study, we determined
   if patterns of time-since-fire (TSF; range 3 yr to 25 yr) affect
   belowground and aboveground biomass in scrubby flatwoods, a type of
   Florida, USA, scrub ecosystem. We also examined if plant groups (oaks,
   palmettos and all other species) show variation in biomass partitioning
   between belowground to aboveground biomass. We found that TSF had a
   significant positive impact on shoot biomass of oaks and leaf litter but
   did not affect total aboveground biomass or the aboveground biomass of
   other species groups. Total belowground biomass was not significantly
   explained by TSF, although the belowground biomass of oaks showed a
   significant quadratic relationship with TSF (r(2) = 0.45, P = 0.023).
   Mean belowground to aboveground biomass ratios were 3.47 +/- 0.76

   belowground biomass patterns to avoid too-frequent burns that may reduce
   belowground biomass and affect the ability of ecosystems to respond to
   subsequent fires. Management actions should also maintain sufficient
   belowground biomass to buffer against periodic drought.}},

   Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs). Pellet-group counts of white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and eastern
   cottontails (Sylvilaqus floridanus), and cervid frequency of browse use
   were used to determine use of oak-pine sites subjected to an array of
   management prescriptions including timber harvest, prescribed fire, and
   traditional food plots. We found that sites subjected to timber harvest
   were used to a greater extent than unharvested sites. Use of food plots
   was similar to harvested and burned sites for elk and deer but not for
   cottontails. Use of burned treatments was unrelated to burn frequency.
   Pellet-group counts and browse utilization frequency measured different
   aspects of habitat use and thereby treatment use. Ranks of pellet-group
   counts by treatments were more reflective of preferred bedding areas or
   screening cover, while ranks of browse utilization frequency indexed
   cervid foraging on a given treatment. Management for elk, deer, and
   rabbits in forests of southeastern Oklahoma should incorporate a mixture
   of commercial timber harvest using natural regeneration and clearcuts to
   provide cover; harvested, thinned, and burned stands to provide forage;
   and a mosaic of mature timber to produce mast rather than relying solely

Abstract = {{Populations of many small mammals in the western United States have
   declined as a consequence of changes in land-use patterns over the past
   century. In California's Central Valley these changes have resulted in
   replacement of native grassland vegetation by non-native annual grasses.
   Jepson Prairie is a natural reserve that has been set aside to preserve
   native vernal pool and bunchgrass habitats. Jepson Prairie also provides
   habitat for several state and federally listed threatened or endangered
   species, including plants insects, and vertebrates. Current management
   of the reserve includes prescribed burning and grazing by domestic sheep
   to foster restoration of native grasses. We examined the effects of
   prescribed burning on small mammals by censusing small mammal
   communities inhabiting burned and unburned habitats over a one-year
   period. Nine censuses (6720 trap-nights) resulted in a total of 215
   captures of five species. Three of these species (deer mouse, Peromyscus
   maniculatus, California vole, Microtus californicus, and Botta's gopher,
   Thomomys bottae) are common in many parts of California. The remaining
   two are either reduced in numbers (California kangaroo rat, Dipodomys
   californicus) or listed as Federal Special Concern (FSC) species by the
   state of California (San Joaquin pocket mouse, Perognathus inornatus
   inornatus); it is worth noting that only one capture was made of the
   latter species. In general, extremely low and varying capture rates
   suggest that Jepson Prairie may be poorly suited to supporting
   populations of small mammals, although habitat management could
   substantially improve conditions for these species.
   For sites such as Jepson Prairie to be managed to maintain small mammal
   populations, we recommend 1) acquisition of upland habitat to provide
   refuge from seasonal flooding; 2) control of domestic and feral cats;
   and 3) a comprehensive prescribed burning program to restore native
   plant species, reducing the need for grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a vital agent of disturbance in African savanna systems, but the
   relative roles of microhabitat conditions, rainfall and species traits
   in faunal recolonization need clarification. In order to understand the
   proximate and ultimate drivers of recolonization after fire, small
   mammals and microhabitat vegetation were sampled in replicated burned
   and control sampling areas before and after randomly applied fire in a
   semi-arid tropical savanna in southern Africa. Vegetation was reduced by
   fire but had recovered well by the end of the first rainy season. A
   total of 6851 small-mammal captures were made during 18816 trap nights.
   Four of the five study species were positively associated with
   increasing vegetation cover and exhibited strong microhabitat
   associations. Fire caused a complete turnover of individuals (due to a
   combination of dispersal and mortality). As predicted using life-history
   traits, in the first year post-fire, Gerbilliscus leucogaster, Mastomys
   spp. and Mus indutus were fire positive/fire neutral at a population
   level, while Steatomys pratensis and Dendromus mesomelas were fire
   negative/fire neutral. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that each species responds to specific structural elements at the
   microhabitat level, has a suite of life-history traits that influence
   their microhabitat associations/response to fire and recolonizes after
   fire as relevant microhabitat elements recover. The hypothesis that
   rainfall stimulates microhabitat recovery and thus is a major
   determinant of the recovery of small-mammal populations after fire was
   also supported. Given the importance of rainfall, climate change could
   pose significant conservation challenges in the long term. Continued
   research on life-history attributes and fire response could result in a
   useful management tool in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{In many regions, planned burns are implemented to reduce fuel loads and
   mitigate wildfire risk; increasingly, they are also used to achieve
   conservation outcomes. However, there is uncertainty regarding how best
   to apply fire to landscapes in order to enhance biodiversity. The
   assumption that variable fire regimes are conducive to biodiversity
   conservation is appealing given its basis in landscape ecological
   theory, which predicts that spatially complex landscapes sustain greater
   biodiversity. This supposition is often used as a basis for fire
   management but has rarely been tested in the context of fire. We sought
   to test predicted positive relationships between bird diversity and both
   landscape diversity and configuration in the fire-prone Otway Ranges,
   southeast Australia, where vegetation transitions from treeless heath to
   tall open eucalypt forest across a rainfall gradient. We used a
   whole-of-landscape sampling approach, and mapped fire age classes and
   vegetation types separately within thirty-six 300 ha landscape sampling
   units. Bird surveys were undertaken at sub-sampling locations during two
   successive years, and presence-absence data were used to generate
   landscape-level estimates of species richness and turnover. Generalized
   linear mixed models, model selection and model averaging were used to
   investigate how birds responded to landscape diversity and configuration
   across the rainfall gradient. Species richness was positively associated
   with age class diversity, age class configuration and vegetation type
   diversity. Species turnover was positively associated with age class
   diversity in areas of lower rainfall but exhibited a negative response
   in areas of higher rainfall. Neither response variable was associated
   with vegetation type configuration. This study is one of few landscape
   scale analyses to provide empirical support for the widely held
   assumption that spatially variable fire regimes can increase the
   diversity of faunal assemblages. Further, our results demonstrated
   consistency in responses of species richness to fire-mediated landscape
   complexity across a rainfall gradient. Managers can potentially increase
   bird species richness by increasing both the diversity of fire age
   classes, and the complexity of age class configuration, within
   relatively small (300 ha) areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Invasion of native lowland dry forests and shrublands on the island of
   Hawai`i by fountaingrass (Pennisetum setaceum) has created a fine fuel
   bed capable of carrying surface fires at frequent, regular intervals. A
   corresponding expansion of the human population into arid leeward areas
   has resulted in an increase in roadside ignitions. These two factors are
   contributing to the conversion of native dry forest and shrubland to
   savanna and grassland, and have resulted in dramatic declines or
   extinction of > 30 endemic plant and animal species. The new fire regime
   also increasingly threatens life and property throughout the northwest
   region of the island. In an effort to develop and refine roadside fuels
   management techniques that could break this cycle, we evaluated the
   effects of single applications of prescribed burning, cattle grazing,
   and aerially applied herbicide, applied alone and in combinations
   between January and May 2004. Fuel loading, vegetation response, and
   soil seedbank composition were monitored over a 1-y period. Prescribed
   burns were the first burns conducted on state land and entailed
   extensive cooperative planning and coordination by local state, county,
   and federal land management and civil service agencies. Burns caused an
   immediate reduction in fountaingrass fuel load. Cattle grazing was not
   effective in reducing fuel loading in this study due to low stocking
   rates applied. Aerially applied glyphosate herbicide effectively killed

Abstract = {{Snags are important components of wildlife habitat, providing nesting
   and feeding sites for over 75 species of animals in the southwestem
   United States. Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of
   snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our
   objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed
   snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona
   and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We
   established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in
   northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 {[}H96] and Pumpkin fire of
   2000 {[}P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by
   wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison,
   six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned
   plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and
   measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in
   unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996
   in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the POO fire. We
   remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were
   standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41\% had fallen.
   Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and
   remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still
   standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density
   of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha(-1)) and
   unburned (2.2 ha(-1)) plots, even though burned areas produced much
   higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were
   most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with
   broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in
   ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags
   is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage
   logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest,
   retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain
   snags for cavity-excavating species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We collated an environmental history for a 8580 km(2) study area in the

   hunter-gatherer economy to pastoralism, the loss of 11 mammal species,
   the cessation of small scale burning by Aboriginal people and the
   introduction of the fox and cat. Annual rainfall was highly variable and
   was influenced by the phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
   Irruptions of rodents, marked increases in the populations of native and
   introduced predators and extensive wildfires were associated with the La
   Nina phase of ENSO and occurred when rain-year (July-June) rainfall
   approached or exceeded the 90th percentile of the historical rainfall
   distribution. Large rainfall events in and Australia have been viewed
   traditionally as the `boom' times that benefit wildlife and pastoral

   wildfire, we show that the years including and immediately following
   flooding rains should be identified as critical, or `bust' periods for
   wildlife and conservation management. ENSO related climatic forecasts
   appear to be useful cues which can be incorporated into fire and

Abstract = {{Intensive management of boreal forests has replaced natural
   disturbances, leading to losses of residual deadwood and saproxylic
   biodiversity. Declining population sizes have been well documented for
   insect groups such as bark and wood-boring beetles, whilst other groups
   such as flat bugs (Heteroptera: Aradidae) are less well-studied and
   little is known about their response to forest restoration. We conducted
   two restoration experiments addressing this lack of knowledge. We
   predicted the following responses to restoration: (1) artificial
   gap-creation and prescribed burning will attract more flat bugs than
   control stands, (2) increasing pre-burning fuel loads will have a
   positive influence on flat bug response to fire restoration. To test
   these predictions we conducted two field experiments; in Sweden we
   compared prescribed burning of standing forest with artificial
   gap-creation and in Finland we compared differing levels of fuel-load
   prior to burning. We found partial support for our first prediction,
   total numbers of flat bugs collected was higher in burned forest stands
   compared to controls in both countries. By contrast, gap-cutting only
   resulted in a marginal increase in the numbers and species of flat bugs
   collected. We found no support for our second hypothesis. The red-listed
   Aradus angularis and A. laeviusculus were primarily found in burned
   stands. Aradus betulae, A. betulinus and A. lugubris were more frequent
   in burned stands than gap-cuttings and untreated controls. Our study
   therefore suggests that ecological restoration, especially burning, is
   an efficient way of attracting flat bugs to suitable habitat, we
   therefore recommend ecological restoration to be incorporated in boreal
   forest management.}},

Pages = {{690-701}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly, patchy prescribed fire of low severity is used by land
   managers to mitigate wildfire risk, but there are relatively few
   experimental studies on the effects of low-severity fire on fauna. We
   used a before-after control-impact experiment to examine avian responses
   to prescribed fire at two scales in topographically variable, tall-open
   eucalypt forest in south-east Australia. We surveyed birds at control
   and impact areas twice before and twice after fire, and applied mixed
   models to investigate responses of avian turnover, richness and the
   occurrence of selected species. Approximately half of the impact area
   was burnt and topographic variation generated a finger-like
   configuration of burnt patches on ridges and unburnt patches in gullies.
   Our findings at the smaller scale (0.8 ha) indicated that the fire
   resulted in increased bird diversity because a patchwork of burnt and
   unburnt areas provided a mosaic of distinct successional states in which
   different species occurred. Additionally, we found that the effect of
   fire on species richness and occurrence was a function of the presence
   of unburnt topographic refuges. In contrast, we found no compelling
   evidence to suggest that birds responded to the fire at the larger scale
   (400 ha). We conclude that application of low-severity fire in a patchy
   manner enhanced avian diversity and facilitated the persistence of the
   birds detected in pre-fire surveys. Although the levels of patchiness
   required to sustain diverse taxa warrant further study, our findings
   highlight the importance of formally incorporating patchiness into
   prescribed burning for the ecologically sensitive management of
   contemporary landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Fire refugia - the unburned areas within fire perimeters - are important
   to the survival of many taxa through fire events and the revegetation of
   post-fire landscapes. Previous work has shown that species use and
   benefit from small-scale fire refugia (1-1000 m(2)), but our
   understanding of where and how fire refugia form is largely limited to
   the scale of remotely sensed data (i.e., 900 m(2) Landsat pixels). To
   examine the causes and consequences of small fire refugia, we
   field-mapped all unburned patches >= 1 m(2 )within a contiguous 25.6ha
   forest plot that burned at generally low-to-moderate severity in the
   2013 Yosemite Rim Fire, California, USA. Within the Yosemite Forest
   Dynamics Plot (YFDP), there were 685 unburned patches >= 1 m(2),
   covering a total unburned area of 12,597 m(2) (4.9\%). Small refugia
   occurred in all fire severity classifications. Random forest models
   showed that the proportion of unburned area of 100 m(2) grid cells
   corresponded to pre-fire density and basal area of trees, distance to
   the nearest stream, and immediate fire mortality, but the relationships
   were complex and model accuracy was variable. From a pre-fire population
   of 34,061 total trees >= 1 cm diameter at breast height (1.37 m; DBH)
   within the plot (1330 trees ha(-1)), trees of all five of the most
   common species and those DBH < 30 cm had higher immediate survival rates
   if their boles were wholly or partially within an unburned patch (P <=
   0.001). Trees 1 cm <= DBH < 10 cm that survived were located closer to
   the center of the unburned patch than the edge (mean 1.1m versus 0.6 m;
   ANOVA; P <= 0.001). Four-year survival rates for trees 1 cm <= DBH < 10
   cm were 58.8\% within small refugia and 2.7\% in burned areas (P <=
   0.001). Species richness and the Shannon Diversity Index were associated
   with unburned quadrats in NMDS ordinations 3 years post-fire. Bum
   heterogeneity in mixed-conifer forests likely exists at all scales and
   small refugia contribute to diversity of forest species and structures.
   Thus, managers may wish to consider scales from 1-m(2) to the landscape
   when designing fuel reduction prescriptions. The partial predictability
   of refugia location suggests that further work may lead to predictive
   models of refugial presence that have considerable potential to preserve
   ecological function or human habitation in fire-frequent forests.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is frequently used as a land management tool for cattle ranching
   and annual crops in the Amazon. However, these maintenance fires often
   escape into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for
   forest biodiversity. We examined the effect of experimental fires on
   leaf-litter arthropod abundance in a seasonally-dry forest in the
   Brazilian Amazon. The study plots (50 ha each) included a thrice-burned
   forest and an unburned control forest. Pitfall-trap samples were
   collected at 160 randomly selected points in both plots, with sampling
   stratified across four intra-annual replicates across the dry and wet
   seasons, corresponding to 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after the most recent
   fire. Arthropods were identified to the level of order (separating
   Formicidae). In order to better understand the processes that determine
   arthropod abundance in thrice-burned forests, we measured canopy
   openness, understory density and litter depth. All arthropod taxa were
   significantly affected by fire and season. In addition, the interactions
   between burn treatment and season were highly significant for all taxa
   but Isoptera. The burned plot was characterized by a more open canopy,
   lower understory density and shallower litter depth. Hierarchical
   partitioning revealed that canopy openness was the most important factor
   explaining arthropod order abundances in the thrice-burned plot, whereas
   all three environmental variables were significant in the unburned
   control plot. These results reveal the marked impact of recurrent
   wildfires and seasonality on litter arthropods in this transitional
   forest, and demonstrate the overwhelming importance of canopy-openness
   in driving post-fire arthropod abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Plant dispersal and colonisation are important processes in vegetation
   recovery after fire and, for several species, depend on the presence of
   frugivorous avian seed dispersers. In burned and salvage-logged
   Mediterranean pine forests, the occurrence of disperser birds is
   enhanced by the presence of wood debris piles built as erosion barriers,
   which become seed dispersal foci. We hypothesised that the distribution
   of bird-dispersed plants after fire could be determined by the presence
   of wood piles. We analysed the differences in species richness and
   overall cover of bird-dispersed plants, as well as the cover of the most
   common species, within piles and outside them. We also tested if
   micro-environmental conditions (slope orientation and pile size) might
   influence plant occurrence. We found more species and overall cover
   within piles, when located on southern and south-eastern slopes, than
   outside them. Moreover, taller piles showed higher values of
   bird-dispersed plant cover and richness. Therefore, wood piles may
   provide the necessary conditions for bird-dispersed plant recruitment in
   dry burned areas. To our knowledge, this is the first reported man-made
   structure that clearly benefits the recovery of bird-dispersed plants in

Abstract = {{The effects of spring burning and habitat-area on breeding bird
   communities were studied on 11 Illinois prairie fragments between 1987
   and 1990. Comparisons of bird distribution and abundance patterns within
   prairie fragments showed three species, the Henslow's sparrow, bobolink,
   and grasshopper sparrow, to be most influenced by prescribed burning.
   Henslow's sparrows completely avoided prairie areas that had been
   recently burned, whereas bobolinks and grasshopper sparrows tended to be
   more common on recently burned prairie areas. A comparison of the
   relative importance of habitat-area and prescribed burning showed that
   habitat-area had a much greater influence on breeding bird community
   composition than prescribed burning. Ten of the 15 most common species
   examined were significantly influenced by habitat-area. An ordination of
   bird communities from the different prescribed burn categories showed
   that bird communities on small prairie fragments were, in general, more
   similar to one another than they were to bird communities on large
   prairie fragments, regardless of the current management status of the
   prairies. I suggest that optimal management strategies for small and
   large prairie fragments need not be the same. Small prairie fragments
   can be burned with little regard to breeding birds because the
   occurrence of their characteristic bird species is not significantly
   influenced by prescribed burning. In contrast, large prairie fragments
   must be managed to provide a mosaic of burned and unburned areas to
   ensure the availability of suitable habitat for management-sensitive
   bird species, species that in the Midwest are experiencing significant
   population declines and are predominately restricted to large grassland

Abstract = {{Land use and fire exclusion have contributed to an increase in ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest extent and density in west-central Idaho.
   Open areas within ponderosa pine forests are decreasing, thus reducing
   habitat for the endemic northern Idaho ground squirrel (NIDGS;
   Urocitellus brunneus brunneus). In 2000, the NIDGS was listed on the
   Endangered Species Act as threatened in part due to habitat loss.
   Therefore, recovery plans encourage the use of burning to expand meadows
   and open corridors. We gathered data on habitat attributes altered by
   prescribed fall burning at three sites selected for habitat restoration.
   Each site was divided into two units: a CONTROL unit occupied by the
   NIDGS and a BURN unit not occupied by the NIDGS. We sought to assess
   whether the prescribed fall burning fulfilled management goals and
   generated habitat features similar to CONTROL conditions that are
   suitable for the NIDGS. Data were collected before the fall prescribed
   burn and one and two years post-burn. Before the prescribed burn, BURN
   units had higher tree densities and canopy cover than CONTROL units;
   however, the prescribed fall burn did not reduce tree density or canopy
   cover one year later. Understory height in the BURN unit decreased
   slightly post-burn, approaching CONTROL conditions. Majority of
   understory characteristics were similar between CONTROL and BURN units
   before, one, and two years after the burn, but understory community
   structure remained strongly dissimilar. This study preliminarily
   examines NIDGS habitat and is the first paper to evaluate the effects of
   prescribed burning as restoration practices to create NIDGS habitat. Key
   habitat attributes associated with NIDGS presence include tree canopy
   cover, understory height and community structure, and litter depth.
   Management goals were not attained within the stated timeline, one year
   post-burn, or even two years after prescribed burn was implemented.
   Based on our results, managers should consider extending the timeframe
   for restoration goal achievement and perhaps modifying goals to include
   changes in tree canopy cover, understory height and community structure,
   and litter depth. Future efforts should monitor beyond two years
   post-fire, focus on long-term effects of prescribed burning, and examine

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands world-wide provide a host of ecosystem services. In
   particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a
   myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds,
   which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by
   extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland
   management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production
   through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that
   historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing
   factor to these declines. An alternative approach to this homogeneous
   management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance
   patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal
   interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of
   pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat
   heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and
   enhancing grassland bird populations. We compared reproductive rates and
   estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands
   maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in
   the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a
   sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. =1)
   and source-sink population dynamics under the two management practices.
   Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows
   Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in
   traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern
   meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed
   grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands. Dickcissels and grasshopper
   sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats
   occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than
   traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source-sink
   dynamics of eastern meadowlarks.Synthesis and applications. Management
   strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore
   landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining
   livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands
   can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for
   reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats
   more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results
   emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine
   source-sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices.
   However, land managers should consider that source-sink models have
   shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily
   mean the habitat has low conservation value.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug]. ex. Laws.) forests
   of the northern Rocky Mountains historically experienced frequent
   low-intensity fires that maintained open uneven-aged stands. A century
   of fire exclusion has contributed to denser ponderosa pine forests with
   greater competition for resources, higher tree stress and greater risk
   of insect attack and stand- destroying fire. Active management intended
   to restore a semblance of the more sustainable historic stand structure
   and composition includes selective thinning and prescribed fire.
   However, little is known about the relative effects of these management
   practices on the physiological performance of ponderosa pine. We
   measured soil water and nitrogen availability, physiological performance
   and wood radial increment of second growth ponderosa pine trees at the
   Lick Creek Experimental Site in the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana,
   8 and 9 years after the application of four treatments: thinning only;
   thinning followed by prescribed fire in the spring: thinning followed by
   prescribed fire in the fall; and untreated controls. Volumetric soil
   water content and resin capsule ammonium did not differ among
   treatments. Resin capsule nitrate in the control treatment was similar
   to that in all other treatments, although burned treatments had lower
   nitrate relative to the thinned-only treatment. Trees of similar size
   and canopy condition in the three thinned treatments (with and without
   fire) displayed higher leaf-area-based photosynthetic rate, stomatal
   conductance and mid-morning leaf water potential in June and July, and
   higher wood radial increment relative to trees in control units.
   Specific leaf area, mass-based leaf nitrogen content and carbon isotope
   discrimination did not vary among treatments. Our results suggest that,
   despite minimal differences in soil resource availability, trees in
   managed units where basal area was reduced had improved gas exchange and
   growth compared with trees in unmanaged units. Prescribed fire (either
   in the spring or in the fall) in addition to thinning, had no measurable
   effect on the mid-term physiological performance and wood growth of
   second growth ponderosapine.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are highly imperiled as a result of widespread conversion for
   agriculture and alteration from human development. Remaining grasslands
   are susceptible to mismanagement, development and fragmentation, and
   variable weather associated with global climate change. Understanding
   the response of declining grassland species to these challenges will be
   important for informed conservation and management. We assessed Greater
   Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) survival and nest site selection in
   tallgrass prairie characterized by interacting fire and grazing
   disturbance and oil and gas infrastructure. We found that Greater
   Prairie-Chicken survival was most affected by weather variability
   (expressed in our models as solar radiation) while most other variables
   had little influence. Focal disturbance did not affect survival
   directly, but vegetation height, which is greatly influenced by fire and
   grazing processes, was positively associated with nest survival. Greater
   Prairie-Chickens chose nesting locations that maximized time post fire
   while minimizing tree cover and distance to leks. Future conservation
   efforts for Greater Prairie-Chickens should focus on variable fire
   regimens that create areas of residual biomass to increase vegetation
   height and potentially reduce the effects of solar radiation while
   decreasing woody vegetation that is avoided by nesting females. However,
   even the best management practices may prove to be futile in the
   southern Great Plains if climate change continues to create unfavorable
   nest survival conditions. Management that creates and maintains suitable
   nesting sites through the use of interacting fire and grazing should
   maximize the potential for high reproduction in years when local weather
   variables are favorable. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society

Abstract = {{Elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are highly valued for their game,
   aesthetic, and spiritual qualities by sportsman, wildlife enthusiasts,
   and Native Americans in North America. As part of the Interior Columbia
   Basin Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP) of the US Forest Service and
   Bureau of Land Management, we: (1) defined key habitat associations of
   those species that could be used for a broad-scale (58 million hectares)
   analysis of management practices and (2) determined how three ecosystem
   management alternatives of a supplemental draft environmental impact
   statement (SDEIS) might affect the regional distribution of habitat for
   those species across the Basin over the next 100 years. For the three
   species, we developed a Bayesian Belief Network model that used
   available SDEIS datasets to estimate historical, current, and future
   habitat capability under the management alternatives in each of the 7467
   subwatersheds (mean 8000 ha) in the study area. The model quantified
   ``inherent habitat capability{''} as a function primarily of forage
   habitat capability, with cover as a minor influence. Forage habitat
   capability was a function of the percentage area of rangeland and early
   seral forest community types, and the qualitative influences of
   livestock overgrazing, wildfire, and prescribed fire. For the current
   and future periods, an ``adjusted habitat capability{''} was estimated
   by adjusting inherent habitat capability for the negative effects of
   poor security from human disturbance. Open road density, cover area, and
   a terrain relief index were used to estimate the security effect.
   Habitat capability was reported by 15 ecological regions within the
   study area as mean subwatershed capability. Under all management
   alternatives, habitat capability increased about 5\% for all three
   ungulate species over the next 100 years. Limitations of the coarse
   analysis scale restrict application of the model to large-scale
   assessments. Lacking regional population data, verification of model
   output was not feasible at the scale of analysis. However, the model was
   considered useful for tracking regional changes given the available
   habitat data and regional-scale objectives of the effort. Published by

Abstract = {{A two-hectare plot of a deciduous dipterocarp-oak forest of Doi
   Suthep-Pui National Park of northern Thailand protected against fire for
   28 years was compared with a similar, but frequently burnt forest nearby
   with respect to changes in tree phenology. The twin objectives of the
   study were to find out the effects of forest fire protection on tree
   phenology using Crown Density Method (CDM) and identify the potential
   uses of satellite images in monitoring tree phenology. Study area was
   identified and located with the help of satellite images (SPOT, Landsat,
   and ERS) and global positioning satellite (GPS). To survey the tree
   communities, six meter wide transects with a total length of 650 m in
   each site were laid out across the slope of the mountain following a
   bearing of 60 degrees. The seasonal variation in leafing, flowering and
   fruiting of trees was monitored over the period of eight months from May
   to December 1996, using crown density method.
   The mean community scores for senescent leaves in November and December
   were significantly higher in the burnt area, than in the protected area.
   Shorea siamensis var. siamensis and Craibiodendron stellatum (Pierre)
   W.W. Sm. retained their leaves longer in the dry season or early rainy
   season in the protected area than in the burnt area. Trees in the burnt
   area had less fruit in May than in the Protected area, even if their
   flowering scores were comparatively higher. Leafing phenologies of
   certain species were greatly altered. Burning seemed to affect the
   fruiting capacity of some of the trees. Overall, this study shows that
   fire protection is a useful conservation management tool in deciduous
   dipterocarp forest for changing tree phenologies toward more favorable
   conditions for wild animals.
   The weak and strong points behind using CDM are given. Potential uses of
   Satellite Images in monitoring tree phenology are described in terms of
   cost, reliability and availability of the space data.}},

Abstract = {{Little fire-related research has been conducted in the high-rainfall
   (>700 mm) Kimberley rangelands, but some extrapolation from studies
   elsewhere in tropical northern Australia can be justified. An increase
   in broad-scale early dry season burning is likely to reduce the extent
   of later more destructive fires while providing other benefits for
   cattle enterprises. Improved animal performance, and contributions to
   the maintenance of rangeland condition and biological diversity would be
   expected. In areas dominated by annual sorghum which escape dry season
   fire, burning during the early part of the wet season should be
   effective in reducing subsequent fuel loads, but effects on pasture
   composition should be monitored. There are considerable difficulties in
   implementation and evaluation of imposed fire regimes, especially
   outside fenced areas. Problems include the logistics of burning large
   areas within a restricted time, integration with mustering operations
   and control of post-fire grazing pressure. Collection of reliable animal
   performance data is hampered by very limited station infrastructure.
   Economic assessment of risks, costs and benefits of fire management
   options should be explored at a property level. Collection and
   application of fire history from satellite data is of crucial importance
   for research, monitoring and management. Urgent efforts are required to
   document the traditional knowledge of local Aboriginal people in

Abstract = {{Restoration and management activities targeted at recovering
   biodiversity can lead to unexpected results. In part, this is due to a
   lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape
   factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management
   practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors
   may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit
   lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the
   importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for
   understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40
   longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the
   federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United
   States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and
   composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with
   agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields)
   supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due
   to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape
   effects did not influence the total number of species in either
   historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory
   species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only
   for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and
   restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was
   accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were
   key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness
   in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these
   activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced
   composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level,
   landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different
   controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying
   land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use
   history and landscape effects during restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying management actions required to maintain desired ecological
   conditions in response to high intensity disturbance events remains a
   critical question, especially as disturbance regimes and species
   composition shift due to human activities and climate change. Feedbacks
   between novel fire disturbance and invasive species on islands, in
   particular, have resulted in the degradation and conversion of native
   ecosystems into more alien species-dominated communities. Further,
   monitoring and evaluation of management responses to these events
   remains sparse. We draw on 14 years of monitoring to assess the effects
   of fire and management response (weed removal and experimentally
   controlled outplanting of native plants), on the structure, composition
   and diversity of a native, mesic tropical forest in Hawaii. Natural
   regeneration of the native, disturbance-adapted tree, Acacia koa was
   rapid and abundant and formed the dominant canopy component after 14
   years. However, naturally recruited native small trees and understory
   plants all declined in abundance over the course of the study. In
   contrast, nonnative, invasive species were highly successful at
   establishing at the site and currently dominate the understory.
   Outplanted native species (Acacia koa, Dodonea viscosa, and Alyxia
   stellata) had relatively high survival and significantly increased
   native species abundance and richness at the site. We conclude that
   despite high natural recruitment of a native overstory tree (Acacia
   koa), restoration management intervention enhanced the native component
   of post-fire vegetation. However, continued intervention will likely be
   required over the long-term to facilitate the recovery of vegetation to
   the pre-fire, native-dominant conditions. As high intensity disturbances
   increase across island ecosystems, understanding and monitoring the
   successional trajectory of both nonnative and native forest species can
   improve the efficiency of management response and allow managers to
   adapt to changes in conditions as well as prioritize actions across
   larger disturbance events.}},

Title = {{Linking landscape futures with biodiversity conservation strategies in

Abstract = {{The most prominent factors inducing landscape change in the rural
   regions of south west Europe are depopulation and the associated
   socio-ecological modifications. The aim of this work was to assess the
   future implications of these processes on land use/land cover and
   biodiversity in northwest Iberia. To achieve our goal, we developed a
   virtual spatially explicit dynamic model to simulate regional
   socio-ecological dynamics. For the period between 1960 and 2040, we
   tested four different environmental scenarios ranging from small
   decreases in conifer forest and a stabilization of agricultural areas
   and shrublands to more radical shifts, substantial decreases in
   agricultural areas and massive expansion of eucalyptus stands. The model
   considers also fire, whose role increased significantly in the scenarios
   of expanded forests. Bird assemblages, which we used as a surrogate for
   biodiversity, showed complex patterns although with overall decreases in
   richness and abundance. Species with narrow niche and from Mediterranean
   open habitats were particularly sensitive to the ongoing changes
   simulated. Our results suggest that landscape management actions and
   planning assessments designed for conserving biodiversity should focus
   on the maintenance of the traditional agricultural mosaic combined with
   a regulatory legislation limiting the expansion of fast growing tree
   forests (e.g Eucalyptus stands). This strategy can contribute to
   maintaining a diversity of land use/land cover in a heterogeneous
   landscape and the prevention of the occurrence of large wildfires,
   fundamental for the implementation of national biodiversity strategies
   and action plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large wild herbivores are crucial to ecosystems and human societies. We
   highlight the 74 largest terrestrial herbivore species on Earth (body
   mass >= 100 kg), the threats they face, their important and often
   overlooked ecosystem effects, and the conservation efforts needed to
   save them and their predators from extinction. Large herbivores are
   generally facing dramatic population declines and range contractions,
   such that similar to 60\% are threatened with extinction. Nearly all
   threatened species are in developing countries, where major threats
   include hunting, land-use change, and resource depression by livestock.
   Loss of large herbivores can have cascading effects on other species
   including large carnivores, scavengers, mesoherbivores, small mammals,
   and ecological processes involving vegetation, hydrology, nutrient
   cycling, and fire regimes. The rate of large herbivore decline suggests
   that ever-larger swaths of the world will soon lack many of the vital

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of how disturbances such as fire shape habitat structure and
   composition, and affect animal interactions, is fundamental to ecology
   and ecosystem management. Predators also exert strong effects on
   ecological communities, through top-down regulation of prey and
   competitors, which can result in trophic cascades. Despite their
   ubiquity, ecological importance and potential to interact with fire, our
   general understanding of how predators respond to fire remains poor,
   hampering ecosystem management. To address this important knowledge gap,
   we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of
   fire on terrestrial, vertebrate predators world-wide. We found 160
   studies spanning 1978-2018. There were 36 studies with sufficient
   information for meta-analysis, from which we extracted 96 effect sizes
   (Hedges' g) for 67 predator species relating to changes in abundance
   indices, occupancy or resource selection in burned and unburned areas,
   or before and after fire. Studies spanned geographic locations,
   taxonomic families and study designs, but most were located in North
   America and Oceania (59\% and 24\%, respectively), and largely focussed
   on felids (24\%) and canids (25\%). Half (50\%) of the studies reported
   responses to wildfire, and nearly one third concerned prescribed
   (management) fires. There were no clear, general responses of predators
   to fire, nor relationships with geographic area, biome or life-history
   traits (e.g. body mass, hunting strategy and diet). Responses varied
   considerably between species. Analysis of species for which at least
   three effect sizes had been reported in the literature revealed that red
   foxes Vulpes vulpes mostly responded positively to fire (e.g. higher
   abundance in burned compared to unburned areas) and eastern racers
   Coluber constrictor negatively, with variances overlapping zero only
   slightly for both species. Our systematic review and meta-analysis
   revealed strong variation in predator responses to fire, and major
   geographic and taxonomic knowledge gaps. Varied responses of predator
   species to fire likely depend on ecosystem context. Consistent reporting
   of ongoing monitoring and management experiments is required to improve
   understanding of the mechanisms driving predator responses to fire, and
   any broader effects (e.g. trophic interactions). The divergent responses
   of species in our study suggest that adaptive, context-specific
   management of predator-fire relationships is required.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a critical land management issue in the western United

   to debate over ecological restoration versus species conservation framed
   at the conjuncture of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and their

   disrupt watershed processes and degrade habitats of sensitive fishes.
   However, the restoration of forest structure, process, and
   functionality, including more natural fire regimes, might also benefit
   longer-term habitat complexity and the persistence of species and
   populations that are now only remnants of once-larger and more diverse
   habitat networks. Common language, clear communication of goals and
   objectives, and spatially explicit analyses of objectives will help
   identify conflicts and convergences of opportunities to enable more
   collaborative management. We explore this integration in the context of
   native fisheries and wildfire, but expect the approach to be relevant in

Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging (i.e. felling and removing burnt trees, often
   eliminating the remaining woody debris) is a practice routinely
   performed by forest managers worldwide. In Mediterranean-type
   ecosystems, salvage logging is considered a measure to reduce future
   reforestation costs, but this assumption remains largely untested. We
   made a cost analysis of different management schemes, addressing the
   immediate post-fire burnt-wood management as well as the costs and
   success of subsequent reforestation efforts. Two experimental 25-ha
   plots were established in a burnt pine reforestation of SE Spain, in
   which three replicates of three post-fire treatments were applied:
   non-intervention (NI), partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and
   lopping off the branches from most of the trees, leaving all biomass in
   situ), and salvage logging (SL). After 4 years, a mechanised
   reforestation was undertaken, and seedling mortality was monitored for 2
   years. The cost of all management operations was recorded in situ, and
   the cost of re-planting the dead seedlings was estimated according to
   the expenses of previous reforestation. Initial cost of wood management
   was greatest in SL and zero in NI. Reforestation cost was highest in NI
   and lowest in SL, and seedling-mortality rates proved lowest in PCL (43
   \% vs. 51 \% and 52 \% in SL and NI, respectively). Considering all the
   post-fire management operations, salvage logging did not provide
   particular economic advantages for forest restoration, and had an
   overall cost of 3,436 +/- A 340 a,not sign/ha. By contrast, NI and PCL
   reduced total restoration costs by 50 and 35 \%, respectively, and PCL
   indeed promoted restoration success. We suggest that the full cost of
   management operations needs to be considered when evaluating the
   economic implications of post-fire salvage logging.}},

Abstract = {{Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in two replicate 1 ha plots of
   each of three experimental fire treatments (annually burned, biennially
   burned, and unburned for over 14 years) in a eucalypt-dominated savanna
   of tropical northern Australia. The ant fauna was extremely diverse,
   with 81 species from 24 genera recorded. Species were classified into
   functional groups based on habitat requirements and competitive
   interactions, with the most important groups being dominant species of
   Iridomyrmex (11 species, 14-63\% total ants in traps); generalized
   myrmicines (mostly species of Monomorium and Pheidole; total of 22
   species, 11-61\% total ants in traps); hot climate specialists (species
   of Melophorus, Monomorium ({''}Chelaner{''}) and Meranoplus; total of 14
   species, 1-16\% total ants in traps); cryptic species (many genera;
   total of 13 species, 2-27\% total ants in traps); and, opportunists
   (mostly species of Rhytidoponera and Tetramorium; total of 11 species,
   3-12\% total ants in traps). Ant communities in the annually burned
   plots were characterized by relatively high numbers of dominant
   Iridomyrmex, hot climate specialists and opportunistic Rhytidoponera
   aurala, and low numbers of generalized myrimicines and cryptic species.
   The reverse was true for unburned plots. Many species were common under
   one fire regime, but were rarely or never recorded under the other.
   These differences were attributed to structural changes in the habitat
   caused by fire, and in particular to the levels of litter accumulation
   and insolation on the ground. These changes influenced ants directly,
   but also had important indirect effects through their influence on the
   abundance of dominant Iridomyrmex, and therefore on competitive
   interactions. The ant communities in the biennially burned plots were
   generally intermediate to those of the unburned and annually burned
   plots. However, one was more similar to those in the annually burned
   plots, while the other resembled those in the unburned plots.
   These results demonstrate that different fire regimes have a major
   influence on one of the most important faunal groups in tropical
   savannas, and this has important implications for conservation
   management in these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous groups are increasingly combining traditional ecological
   knowledge and Western scientific approaches to inform the management of
   their lands. We report the outcomes of a collaborative research project
   focused on key ecological questions associated with monsoon vine
   thickets in Wunambal Gaambera country (Kimberley region, Western
   Australia). The study mapped monsoon rainforests and analysed the
   environmental correlates of their current distribution, as well as the
   historical drivers of patch dynamics since 1949. Remote sensing was used
   to chart the effectiveness of an intervention designed to re-instate
   Aboriginal fire regimes according to customary principles. We identified
   the most vulnerable patches based on size, distance from neighbouring
   patches, and fire frequency. More than 6000 rainforest patches were
   mapped. Most were small (<1 ha), occurring predominantly on
   nutrient-rich substrates (e.g., basalt) and fire-sheltered topographic
   settings (e.g., slopes and valleys). Rainforests with low fire frequency
   and no cattle were more likely to expand into surrounding long-unburnt
   savannas. Frequent fires and cattle did not cause substantial
   contraction, although the latter affected rainforest understories
   through trampling. Fire management performed by Aboriginal rangers
   effectively shifted fire regimes from high-intensity late dry season
   fires to early dry season fires, particularly in areas with clusters of
   vulnerable rainforests. The remote sensing methods developed in this
   project are applicable to the long-term monitoring of rainforest patches
   on Aboriginal-managed land in North Kimberley, providing tools to
   evaluate the impacts of fire management, feral animal control, and
   climate change. The study confirmed the importance of the cattle-free
   and rarely burnt Bougainville Peninsula as one of the most important

Abstract = {{Fire is a major agent involved in landscape transformation and an
   indirect cause of changes in species composition. Responses to fire may
   vary greatly depending on life histories and functional traits of
   species. We have examined the taxonomic and functional responses to fire
   of eight taxonomic animal groups displaying a gradient of dietary and
   mobility patterns: Gastropoda, Heteroptera, Formicidae, Coleoptera,
   Araneae, Orthoptera, Reptilia and Aves. The fieldwork was conducted in a
   Mediterranean protected area on 3 sites (one unburnt and two burnt with
   different postfire management practices) with five replicates per site.
   We collected information from 4606 specimens from 274 animal species.
   Similarity in species composition and abundance between areas was
   measured by the Bray-Curtis index and ANOSIM, and comparisons between
   animal and plant responses by Mantel tests. We analyze whether groups
   with the highest percentage of omnivorous species, these species being
   more generalist in their dietary habits, show weak responses to fire
   (i.e. more similarity between burnt and unburnt areas), and independent
   responses to changes in vegetation. We also explore how mobility, i.e.
   dispersal ability, influences responses to fire. Our results demonstrate
   that differences in species composition and abundance between burnt and
   unburnt areas differed among groups. We found a tendency towards
   presenting lower differences between areas for groups with higher
   percentages of omnivorous species. Moreover, taxa with a higher
   percentage of omnivorous species had significantly more independent
   responses of changes in vegetation. High- (e.g. Aves) and low-mobility
   (e.g. Gastropoda) groups had the strongest responses to fire (higher R
   scores of the ANOSIM); however, we failed to find a significant general
   pattern with all the groups according to their mobility. Our results
   partially support the idea that functional traits underlie the response
   of organisms to environmental changes caused by fire.}},

Abstract = {{The Florida Scrub ecosystem depends on fire to sustain ecosystem
   function and to support resident plant and animal species. A recent
   study addressed the relationship between the time since last fire (TSF)
   and resident amphibians and reptiles in rosemary bald, one Florida Scrub
   habitat type. This is a parallel study in another Florida Scrub habitat
   type, scrubby flatwoods, at Archbold Biological Station (ABS), Lake
   Placid, Florida, USA. We installed 36 400-m(2) enclosures (four burn
   units within each of three TSF categories X 3 replicates per burn unit)
   at ABS. Bucket trap sampling, within and outside the enclosures,
   occurred during the spring and late summer in 2007 and 2008. Ten
   environmental variables that reflect differences in the biotic and
   abiotic conditions of the microhabitats associated with different TSF
   were surveyed. Eleven species of reptiles and six species of amphibians
   were captured. Three lizard species together accounted for > 95\% of the
   reptile captures, and two toad species together accounted for > 96\% of
   the amphibian captures. Abundance of the Florida Sand Skink (Plestiodon
   reynoldsi Stejneger) was highest in long-unburned areas, probably
   because of the accumulated litter; but abundances of the other two
   lizard species did not show a relationship with TSF. Differences in
   relative abundances of species between sampling years may be a function
   of the difference in rainfall. Despite substantial variation in sampling
   methods between this study and the previous one, the herpetofaunal
   composition of the two habitat types were found to be similar;
   differences in diversity between them was attributable mostly to
   differences in relative abundances. Species inhabiting the Florida Scrub
   ecosystem respond differently to TSF: the federally-listed Florida Scrub
   Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens Bosc), for example, requires more frequent
   burning than appears to be the case for the Florida Sand Skink. A land
   management plan of stochastic return intervals and spatial variation of
   high-intensity fires to maintain a mosaic landscape would be ideal; but
   management options for maintaining the diversity of all species
   inhabiting the Florida scrub ecosystem are limited, because of the
   generally small size of remaining habitat patches.}},

Abstract = {{Background Even though fire has been used extensively as part of

   Histopathological examinations of species were conducted from different

   smoke inhalation as a possible cause of death. However, the relative
   absence of carbon-rich particulate matter and the occasional presence of
   pulmonary oedema suggested asphyxiation, heat-induced cardiac arrest, or
   gas intoxication as the most likely cause of death. The association of
   most specimens with microhabitats rich in leaf litter may indicate
   higher reptile densities in this habitat or increased mortalities due to
   smoldering detrital material, or both. Detrital combustion and
   smoldering may result in advective transportation of heated gasses into
   underlying soil layers, with subsequent increased mortalities.
   Conclusion Even though burrowing could potentially offer protection from
   fire to fossorial vertebrates through vertical movements into deeper
   substrate, our results indicated that they are not necessarily protected
   from fire effects. We speculate that seasonal reproductive behavior may
   contribute to fire mortality. These observations may contribute to
   improved understanding and management of fire in areas where fossorial
   reptiles occur.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of a disturbance regime, flora at historical oak sand
   barrens change as leaf litter builds up and increasing canopy cover
   shades bare soils. Over time, black oak sand barrens become more mesic,
   and other trees including Acer rubrum, Fraxinus sp., Prunus serotina,
   and Sassafras albidum often mix with oaks in the canopy. Three different
   restoration techniques were applied to recreate disturbance across 10
   sites within degraded black oak (Quercus velutina) glacial kames, which
   are mounds of sand and gravel deposited by melting ice sheets: select
   canopy tree thinning favoring 5-30\% tree canopy cover, forest floor
   leaf litter removal, and prescribed fire. Ground layer richness and
   abundance 1 and 3 y after treatment were assessed within modified North
   Carolina Vegetation Survey plots and compared against both temporally
   and spatially equivalent control sites. Thinning the canopy induced the
   greatest vegetation response in species diversity, whether as
   xeric-tolerant indicator species, graminoid species, as a taxonomic
   group, or pooling all plants. Leaf litter removal produced a modest
   pulse response from a few select species released from the
   shade-creating effects of accumulating leaf litter. Prescribed burns did
   not create a disturbance sufficient for any significant plant response,
   presumably because low-intensity burning minimally reduced leaf litter
   cover. Thus, manipulations that opened the canopy and reduced soil
   moisture more directly induced barren-species recovery than did efforts
   to recreate historical disturbance processes.}},

   Relationship of Termites to Fire}},
Journal = {{SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{313-352}},
Abstract = {{In forests, termites serve as ``soil engineers,{''} translocating
   mineral soil to the surface, constructing macropores to improve water
   infiltration, increase soil minerals and organic carbon, facilitate the
   growth of microbes and affect the growth of vegetation. The future
   productivity of a forest site therefore depends to some degree on
   termite activity. Termites could reduce the probability of forest fire
   by reducing fuel loads, either through direct consumption of the wood or
   through the augmentation of decay fungi. Should a fire adversely affect
   termite populations in a forest, the decomposition of unburned woody
   debris will be delayed and nutrient cycling in the forest will be
   interrupted. For small fires, such as prescribed burning, such
   interruption is largely a non-issue. Catastrophic or stand-replacing
   wildfire, however, might affect termite populations in three
   non-mutually exclusive ways: direct mortality due to the fire itself,
   through the conversion of cellulose to indigestible materials, and
   through alterations of the soil. Due to their slow dispersal relative to
   other soil organisms, termites re-colonize severely burned areas slowly,
   but can be instrumental in the rehabilitation of waste areas. Termite
   presence might be augmented to increase the future productivity of a
   severely burned site. This paper is a review of termite contributions to
   forest health and fire prevention, the effects of fire on termite
   populations, the re-colonization of severely burned areas, and the
   contribution of termites to waste area rehabilitation.}},

Pages = {{73-85}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Surface coal mining and subsequent reclamation of surface mines have
   converted large forest areas into early successional vegetative
   communities in the eastern United States. This reclamation can provide a
   novel opportunity to conserve northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus).
   We evaluated the influence of habitat management activities on nest
   survival, nest-site selection, and brood resource selection on managed
   and unmanaged units of a reclaimed surface mine, Peabody Wildlife
   Management Area (Peabody), in west-central Kentucky, USA, from 2010 to
   2013. We compared resource selection, using discrete-choice analysis,
   and nest survival, using the nest survival model in Program MARK,
   between managed and unmanaged units of Peabody at 2 spatial scales: the
   composition and configuration of vegetation types (i.e., macrohabitat)
   and vegetation characteristics at nest sites and brood locations (i.e.,
   microhabitat). On managed sites, we also investigated resource selection
   relative to a number of different treatments (e.g., herbicide, disking,
   prescribed fire). We found no evidence that nest-site selection was
   influenced by macrohabitat variables, but bobwhite selected nest sites
   in areas with greater litter depth than was available at random sites.
   On managed units, bobwhite were more likely to nest where herbicide was
   applied to reduce sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) compared with
   areas untreated with herbicide. Daily nest survival was not influenced
   by habitat characteristics or by habitat management but was influenced
   by nest age and the interaction of nest initiation date and nest age.
   Daily nest survival was greater for older nests occurring early in the
   breeding season (0.99, SE<0.01) but was lower for older nests occurring
   later in the season (0.08, SE=0.13). Brood resource selection was not
   influenced by macrohabitat or microhabitat variables we measured, but
   broods on managed units selected areas treated with herbicide to control
   sericea lespedeza and were located closer to firebreaks and disked
   native-warm season grass stands than would be expected at random. Our
   results suggest the vegetation at Peabody was sufficient without
   manipulation to support nesting and brood-rearing northern bobwhite at a
   low level, but habitat management practices improved vegetation for
   nesting and brood-rearing resource selection. Reproductive rates (e.g.,
   nest survival and re-nesting rates) at Peabody were lower than reported
   in other studies, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies
   caused by the abundance of sericea lespedeza. On reclaimed mine lands
   dominated by sericea lespedeza, we suggest continuing practices such as
   disking and herbicide application that are targeted at reducing sericea
   lespedeza to improve the vegetation for nesting and brood-rearing
   bobwhite. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{An intense debate exists on the effects of post-fire salvage logging on
   plant community regeneration, but scant data are available derived from
   experimental studies. We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on
   plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity,
   cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a
   Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots
   located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments
   were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of
   intervention: ``Non-Intervention{''} (all trees left standing),
   ``Partial Cut plus Lopping{''} (felling 90\% of the trees, cutting the
   main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and ``Salvage
   Logging{''} (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody
   debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years
   after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was
   associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total
   plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species
   assemblages and 25\% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of
   resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs
   was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential
   slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent
   among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities.
   Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species
   richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species,
   which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Although native herbivores can alter fire regimes by consuming
   herbaceous vegetation that serves as fine fuel and, less commonly,
   accumulating fuel as nest material and other structures, simultaneous
   considerations of contrasting effects of herbivores on fire have
   scarcely been addressed. We proposed that a colonial rodent, vizcacha
   (Lagostomus maximus), reduces and increases fire intensity at different
   stages in its population cycle in the semiarid scrub of Argentina.
   Specifically, we hypothesized that, when colonies are active, vizcachas
   create natural fire-breaks through intense grazing, generating over time
   patches of large unburned shrubs in grazed zones. In contrast, when
   colonies are abandoned, recovery of fine fuels and previous accumulation
   of coarse wood on colonies during territorial displays increases fire
   intensity, creating patches of high shrub mortality. To test these
   hypotheses, we estimated stem age of the dominant shrub (Larrea
   divaricata) and measured aboveground biomass in zones actively grazed by
   vizcachas and in ungrazed zones, and compared densities of live and dead
   shrubs on abandoned colonies and adjacent zones following fire. In
   active colonies, age and biomass of shrubs were much greater in grazed
   than ungrazed zones. In abandoned colonies that had been burnt, density
   of dead, burned shrubs was higher and density of live shrubs was lower
   than in adjacent zones. These results support our hypotheses and reveal
   a new interaction between native herbivores and fire, in which
   herbivores augment fire intensity by gathering fuel. Our findings
   indicate that, through opposing effects on fire, native herbivores
   enhance the heterogeneity of vegetation in woody-dominated ecosystems.}},

   assemblages is independent of fire regime}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prescribed burning is an important management tool in jarrah
   (Eucalyptus marginata Sm.) forests of southwest Western Australia to
   reduce the risk of damaging bushfires. In 1986 to 1987, we established
   long-term study sites in dry (mean annual rainfall similar to 700 mm)
   and moist (mean annual rainfall similar to 1000 mm) jarrah forests to
   assess the effects of prescribed burning, as well as other fire
   treatments including fire exclusion, on the composition, richness, and
   relative abundance of forest understory vegetation.
   Results: Over almost 30 years, species assemblages within all fire
   treatments changed significantly through time, but the changes were
   independent of treatment. The pattern of change in composition of fire
   response types over elapsed time was different between sites. At the dry
   site, changes in species assemblages were initially relatively large in
   the first decade or so of the study, but slowed thereafter. At the moist
   site, compositional change driven by obligate seeding shrubs occurred
   faster and more uniformly with time across all treatments. Species
   richness was also independent of fire treatment at both sites. Species
   richness decreased with elapsed time on the moist site but increased
   with elapsed time on the dry site. The stronger elapsed-time effect
   rendered the time since fire effect on loss of species richness on the
   moist site to be insignificant, but there was an inverse relationship
   with time since fire at the dry site. Within each site, there were clear
   patterns of changing abundance based on life form and fire response
   groups, but this was not consistent between sites.
   Conclusions: At the scale of the current study, jarrah forest plant
   communities displayed resilience to imposed experimental fire regimes.
   Over time, either elapsed time or time since fire, species assemblages
   across all treatments changed regardless of fire treatment, but changes
   were mostly associated with specific plant life forms and fire response
   traits, suggesting that the process is both deterministic and
   stochastic. While many species changed in abundance over time, no
   species were lost as a result of the fire treatments. Within the fire
   frequency and intensity ranges investigated in this study, there was
   flexibility in the application of prescribed fire to achieve management
   objectives without loss of plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Native bushland fragmented by urbanization often experiences increased
   cover of flammable weeds, reduced biomass turnover and an absence of
   fuel management combined with increased ignitions. Depending on species'
   mobility and dispersal traits, and the extent of burns within urban
   remnants, such fires may reduce individual survival rates or limit
   natural recolonization. We monitored the survival of mygalomorph spiders
   for a year following high-intensity and low-intensity fires in Banksia
   woodland remnants in urban Perth. Of the 257 burrows found, 115 spiders
   were confirmed to initially survive after intense wildfire, but none
   were confirmed alive after 12months. In sharp contrast, only one spider
   from 103 observed burrows was confirmed dead after a low-intensity
   prescribed fire. As there were instances of our monitored mygalomorphs
   relocating a short distance following only low intensity fires, we also
   tested whether predation rates were higher in burnt than unburnt areas.
   Higher rates of predation were found in burnt areas, but this was
   strongly influenced by both site and predator type. We recommend further
   consideration of low-intensity prescribed fire as well as alternative

   microclimates within talus and explore habitat factors promoting
   persistence and abundance in fire-affected habitat. During the fire,
   temperatures in talus interstices remained below 19 degrees C,
   suggesting that animals could have survived in situ. Within 2 years,
   pikas were widely distributed throughout burned areas and did not appear
   to be physiologically stressed at severely burned sites. Furthermore,
   pika densities were better predicted by topographic variables known to
   affect this species than by metrics of fire severity. This widespread
   distribution may reflect quick vegetation recovery and the fact that the
   fire did not alter the talus microclimates in the following years.
   Together, these results highlight the value of talus as a thermal refuge

Abstract = {{1. Fire-killed timber is considered as a loss of potential revenues and
   is thus increasingly salvaged, though not without concerns for
   biodiversity conservation. Indeed, a large diversity of burn-associated
   saproxylic beetles use recently burned trees.
   2. This study intends to reduce potential impacts of salvage logging on
   biodiversity by identifying high conservation value forests (HCVFs) for
   burn-associated beetles, which are considered the most at risk.
   3. In five burns ignited naturally in 2010 in the eastern Canadian
   boreal forest, we selected 31 and 29 stands of black spruce and jack
   pine respectively. Three 50-cm bole segments were retrieved from each
   stand and placed in emergence cages to measure tree utilisation by
   saproxylic beetles. This yielded 7235 beetles from 103 taxa, of which 67
   were considered rare (<5\% occurrence in logs) and 36 as common taxa
   (>5\% occurrence in logs).
   4. Among the common taxa, we identified six groups of ecologically
   related species using co-occurrence-based hierarchical clustering, among
   which three were mainly formed by opportunistic species that are
   currently of little concern in a post-fire logging context. The three
   other groups were formed by burn-associated species that could be
   affected by salvage logging.
   5. HCVFs include jack pine stands and large trees of either tree species
   of low-to mid-range burn severity. We also recommend retaining the
   periphery of burned stands, as ecotones are rich habitats used by
   several burn-associated species that are found in low numbers in green
   forests but they benefit from burned habitats by increasing their
   populations significantly.}},

   and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3
   stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we
   conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6
   and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3
   years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence
   analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying
   bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We
   detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in
   burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle
   and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker
   home range size increased across stands representing increasing time
   since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned
   areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3
   years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after
   fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in
   high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy
   woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the
   interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and
   woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance
   and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and
   woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in
   response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range
   size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas
   provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary
   cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and
   greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers
   suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey
   and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when
   trees are removed along severely burned edges.}},

Abstract = {{A population of frillneck lizards, Chlamydosaurus kingii, was monitored
   by radio telemetry and mark-recapture techniques between April 1991 and
   April 1994, as part of a landscape-scale fire experiment, in Kakadu
   National. Park, Northern Territory. The study aimed to investigate both
   the short- and longer-term effects of fire on a lizard species in a
   tropical savanna where fires are frequent and often annual. Frillneck
   lizards are able to survive fires that occur in the first few months of
   the dry season by remaining perched in trees. A high level of mortality
   (29\%) occurred during late dry-season fires, along with changes in
   their behavioural response to fire: sheltering in either larger trees or
   hollow termite mounds. Food is more accessible after fires due to the
   removal of ground vegetation This is reflected in greater volume and
   diversity of prey in stomach contents after fires. This increase is more
   pronounced after late dry-season fires, possibly due to increased
   accessibility of prey caused by more complete vegetation removal.
   Frillneck lizards show an overall preference for trees with a dense
   canopy cover located in an area with a low density of grass. Fire has an
   effect on this relationship. Frillneck lizards in habitat unburnt for a
   number of years tend to perch, in trees with a smaller canopy, whereas
   lizards in annually burnt habitat perch in trees with a dense canopy.
   Volume and composition of Lizard stomach contents was broadly similar
   among fire treatments over a 2 year period, although termites were more
   predominant in stomach contents of lizards in unburnt habitat.
   Wet-season body condition is lower in lizards from unburnt habitat,
   although the reason for this is unclear. These results demonstrate the
   importance of different fire intensities and regimes on the ecology of a
   lizard species in a tropical savanna.}},

Abstract = {{Forestry practices such as prescribed fire and wildfire management can
   modify the nutritional resources of ungulates across broad landscapes.
   To evaluate the influences of fire and forest management on ungulate
   nutrition, we measured and compared forage quality and abundance among a
   range of land cover types and fire histories within 3 elk ranges in
   Montana. We used historical fire data to assess fire-related variations
   in elk forage from 1900 to 2015. Fire affected summer forage more
   strongly than winter forage. Between 1900-1990 and 1990-2015, elk summer
   range burned by wildfire increased 242-1772 per cent, whereas the area
   on winter range burned by wildfire was low across all decades. Summer
   forage quality peaked in recently burned forests and decreased as time
   since burn increased. Summer forage abundance peaked in dry forests
   burned 6-15 years prior and mesic forests burned within 5 years. Forests
   recently burned by wildfire had higher summer forage quality and
   herbaceous abundance than those recently burned by prescribed fire.
   These results suggest that the nutritional carrying capacity for elk
   varies temporally with fire history and management practices. Our
   methods for characterizing nutritional resources provide a relatively
   straightforward approach for evaluating nutritional adequacy and
   tracking changes in forage associated with disturbances such as fire.}},

Abstract = {{In developing countries, governments often lack the authority and
   resources to implement conservation outside of protected areas. In such
   situations, the integration of conservation with local livelihoods is
   crucial to species recovery and reintroduction efforts. The hirola
   Beatragus hunteri is the world's most endangered antelope, with a
   population of <500 individuals that is restricted to <5\% of its
   historical geographic range on the Kenya-Somali border. Long-term hirola
   declines have been attributed to a combination of disease and rangeland
   degradation. Tree encroachment-driven by some combination of extirpation
   of elephants, overgrazing by livestock, and perhaps fire suppression-is
   at least partly responsible for habitat loss and the decline of
   contemporary populations. Through interviews in local communities across
   the hirola's current range, we identified socially acceptable strategies
   for habitat restoration and hirola recovery. We used classification and
   regression trees, conditional inference trees, and generalized linear
   models to identify sociodemographic predictors of support for
   range-restoration strategies. Locals supported efforts to conserve
   elephants (which kill trees and thus facilitate grass growth), seed and
   fertilize grass, and remove trees, but were opposed to livestock
   reduction. Locals were ambivalent toward controlled burns and soil
   ripping (a practice through which soil is broken up to prevent
   compaction). Livestock ownership and years of residency were key
   predictors of locals' perceptions toward rangeland-restoration
   practices. Locals owning few livestock were more supportive of elephant
   conservation, and seeding and fertilization of grass, while longer term
   residents were more supportive of livestock reduction but were less
   supportive of elephant conservation. Ultimately, wildlife conservation
   outside protected areas requires long-term, community-based efforts that
   are compatible with human livelihoods. We recommend elephant
   conservation, grass seeding and fertilization, manual tree removal and
   resting range from livestock both to enhance the potential for hirola
   recovery and to build positive rapport with local communities in the
   geographic range of this critically endangered species.}},

Abstract = {{We used the LANDIS model to study the long-term cumulative effects of
   postfire 10-year management (harvest and reforestation) on species
   abundance, age structure, and spatial pattern in the Tuqiang Forest
   Bureau on the northern slopes of the Great Hing'an Mountains after a
   catastrophic fire in 1987. Two simulation scenarios were constructed:
   the actual postfire management scenario and the natural regeneration
   scenario that assumed no postfire management activities occurred after
   the 1987 fire. Both scenarios were run with 10 replicated simulations
   per scenario over a 300-year period. Our results indicated that postfire
   management had a significant influence on species abundance, age
   structure, and spatial pattern. Postfire management effectively
   increased the abundance of coniferous trees (larch (Larix gmelinii) and
   Mongolian Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica)), increased the
   abundance of white birch in the short-term simulation stage, and
   decreased the abundance of white birch (Betula platyphylla) in the long
   run. The aggregation level of white birch responded similarly to
   postfire management - increasing initially, and then decreasing over
   time. However, compared with the natural regeneration scenario, postfire
   management resulted in more fragmented larch and Mongolian Scotch pine,
   which could last for about 100-150 years because of timber harvesting in
   the first 10 years postfire. In addition, the age structure of larch
   forests under the postfire management scenario changed dramatically
   during the 300 simulation years: the abundance of mature and old-growth
   age classes of larch forests decreased dramatically in the first 10
   years, but then increased and exceeded that under the natural
   regeneration scenario after about 100 simulation years. Therefore,
   although postfire management had a positive cumulative effect (less
   fragmented and more larch abundance) on forest recovery at the long-term
   successional stage, postfire management, especially timber harvesting
   within the first 10 years after the 1987 fire, posed negative effects
   (more fragmented and less mature forests) at short- and mid-term
   successional stages (about 100 years).}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone ecosystems, many species regenerate after fire from
   persistent soil seed banks. Species with physically dormant (PY) seeds
   have dormancy broken by fire-related heat. The magnitude of post-fire
   recruitment, to predict response to varying fire severity, is commonly
   estimated by testing dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds of fresh
   PY seeds. However, seeds spend years in the soil during the inter-fire
   period, and determining whether dormancy-breaking thresholds change over
   time is essential to accurately predict population persistence.
   Germination of four south-eastern Australian PY species from the
   Fabaceae family (Acacia linifolia, Aotus ericoides, Bossiaea
   heterophylla and Viminaria juncea) were studied. Dormancy-breaking
   temperature thresholds vary inter-specifically and the species
   represented either high or low dormancy-breaking threshold classes.
   Freshly collected seeds, and seeds that had been buried in the field or
   stored in dry laboratory conditions for 6 and 18 months were subjected
   to a fire-related range of heat treatments (40-100 degrees C). Seed
   ageing increased germination response to heat treatments, effectively
   lowering the dormancy-breaking thresholds of three species. The fourth
   species, A. linifolia, initially had a relatively large non-dormant
   fraction which was lost as seeds aged, with older seeds then displaying
   PY broadly similar to the other study species. Patterns of threshold
   decay were species-specific, with the thresholds and viability of
   low-threshold species declining more rapidly than high-threshold
   species. The non-dormant fraction did not increase over time for any of
   our study species. Instead of increasing their non-dormant fraction, as
   is common in other vegetation types, these fire-prone PY species
   displayed a change of dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds. This is
   an important distinction, as maintaining dormancy during the inter-fire
   period is essential for population persistence. While changes in
   sensitivity to dormancy-breaking treatments have previously been
   reported as seeds age, our study provides the first test of changes to
   temperature thresholds, which increases the range of germination
   response from the seed bank under varying fire severity.}},

Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fire shapes the composition and functioning of ecosystems globally. In
   many regions, fire is actively managed to create diverse patch mosaics
   of fire-ages under the assumption that a diversity of post-fire-age
   classes will provide a greater variety of habitats, thereby enabling
   species with differing habitat requirements to coexist, and enhancing
   species diversity (the pyrodiversity begets biodiversity hypothesis).
   However, studies provide mixed support for this hypothesis. Here, using
   termite communities in a semi-arid region of southeast Australia, we
   test four key assumptions of the pyrodiversity begets biodiversity
   hypothesis (i) that fire shapes vegetation structure over sufficient
   time frames to influence species' occurrence, (ii) that animal species
   are linked to resources that are themselves shaped by fire and that peak
   at different times since fire, (iii) that species' probability of
   occurrence or abundance peaks at varying times since fire and (iv) that
   providing a diversity of fire-ages increases species diversity at the
   landscape scale. Termite species and habitat elements were sampled in
   100 sites across a range of fire-ages, nested within 20 landscapes
   chosen to represent a gradient of low to high pyrodiversity. We used
   regression modelling to explore relationships between termites, habitat
   and fire. Fire affected two habitat elements (coarse woody debris and
   the cover of woody vegetation) that were associated with the probability
   of occurrence of three termite species and overall species richness,
   thus supporting the first two assumptions of the pyrodiversity
   hypothesis. However, this did not result in those species or species
   richness being affected by fire history per se. Consequently, landscapes
   with a low diversity of fire histories had similar numbers of termite
   species as landscapes with high pyrodiversity. Our work suggests that
   encouraging a diversity of fire-ages for enhancing termite species
   richness in this study region is not necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat has changed unfavorably during the past 150 y for the desert
   tortoise Gopherus agassizii, a federally threatened species with
   declining populations in the Mojave Desert and western Sonoran Desert.
   To support recovery efforts, we synthesized published information on
   relationships of desert tortoises with three habitat features (cover
   sites, forage, and soil) and candidate management practices for
   improving these features for tortoises. In addition to their role in
   soil health and facilitating recruitment of annual forage plants, shrubs
   are used by desert tortoises for cover and as sites for burrows.
   Outplanting greenhouse-grown seedlings, protected from herbivory, has
   successfully restored (>50\% survival) a variety of shrubs on disturbed
   desert soils. Additionally, salvaging and reapplying topsoil using
   effective techniques is among the more ecologically beneficial ways to
   initiate plant recovery after severe disturbance. Through differences in
   biochemical composition and digestibility, some plant species provide
   better-quality forage than others. Desert tortoises selectively forage
   on particular annual and herbaceous perennial species (e.g., legumes),
   and forage selection shifts during the year as different plants grow or
   mature. Nonnative grasses provide low-quality forage and contribute fuel
   to spreading wildfires, which damage or kill shrubs that tortoises use
   for cover. Maintaining a diverse ``menu{''} of native annual forbs and
   decreasing nonnative grasses are priorities for restoring most desert
   tortoise habitats. Reducing herbivory by nonnative animals, carefully
   timing herbicide applications, and strategically augmenting annual
   forage plants via seeding show promise for improving tortoise forage
   quality. Roads, another disturbance, negatively affect habitat in
   numerous ways (e.g., compacting soil, altering hydrology). Techniques
   such as recontouring road berms to reestablish drainage patterns,
   vertical mulching ({''}planting{''} dead plant material), and creating
   barriers to prevent trespasses can assist natural recovery on
   decommissioned backcountry roads. Most habitat enhancement efforts to
   date have focused on only one factor at a time (e.g., providing fencing)
   and have not included proactive restoration activities (e.g., planting
   native species on disturbed soils). A research and management priority
   in recovering desert tortoise habitats is implementing an integrated set
   of restorative habitat enhancements (e.g., reducing nonnative plants,
   improving forage quality, augmenting native perennial plants, and
   ameliorating altered hydrology) and monitoring short-and long-term
   indicators of habitat condition and the responses of desert tortoises to
   habitat restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an integral disturbance shaping forest community dynamics over

   induced habitat disturbance and biodiversity remain equivocal.
   Ecological theories including the intermediate disturbance hypothesis
   (IDH) and the habitat accommodation model (HAM) offer predictive
   frameworks that could explain faunal responses to fire disturbances. We
   used an 80 year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small reptile
   community responses to fires in temperate forests across 74 sites.
   First, we evaluated if changes in species richness, abundance and
   evenness post-fire followed trends of prior predictions, including the
   IDH. Second, using competing models of fine scale habitat elements we
   evaluated the specific ways which fire influenced small reptiles. Third,
   we evaluated support for the HAM by examining compositional changes of
   reptile community post-fire. Relative abundance was positively
   correlated to age post-fire while richness and evenness showed no
   associations. The abundance trend was as expected based on the prior
   prediction of sustained population increase post-disturbance, but the
   trend for richness contradicted the prediction of highest diversity at
   intermediate levels of disturbance (according to IDH). Abundance changes
   were driven mainly by changes in overstorey, ground layer, and shelter,
   while richness and evenness did not associate with any vegetation
   parameter. Community composition was not strongly correlated to age
   since fire, thus support for the HAM was weak. Overall, in this
   ecosystem, frequent fire disturbances can be detrimental to small
   reptiles. Future studies utilizing approaches based on species traits

Abstract = {{There are 195 vertebrate species occurring in mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) infested areas in interior British
   Columbia that will likely be impacted by beetle control measures. The
   effects of these measures on wildlife will depend on whether they
   increase or decrease the availability of critical habitat attributes
   such as large trees, dead and dying trees, down wood, shrubby
   undergrowth, continuous canopy cover, and deciduous trees. Shifting the
   forest age class distribution to early seral stages to reduce landscape
   susceptibility to mountain pine beetle attack will harm many wildlife
   species that are dependent on mature forest conditions, but will benefit
   the few species that thrive in more open habitats. In contrast, the
   conversion of lodgepole pine forests to non-pine tree species, and fall
   and burn treatments, should have relatively minor impacts. The effects
   of many beetle control measures on wildlife will devolve to the effects
   of tree retention level on wildlife. Manipulating the tree retention
   level, and the size, location and dispersion pattern of residual trees
   and tree patches can significantly advance wildlife management goals. We
   conclude this paper by suggesting potential approaches to integrating
   mountain pine beetle control with wildlife and sustainable management
   objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that the Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides
   tridactylus) is strongly favored by large-scale disturbances, including
   forest fires. However, natural disturbances have largely disappeared
   from European boreal forests because of modern forestry practices and
   fire suppression. We currently lack knowledge on the foraging activity
   and resource use of the Eurasian Three-toed Woodpecker, especially in
   burned forests, and this restricts our ability to develop strategies for
   sustainable forest management and ecological restoration aiming at
   improving the situation of this woodpecker and associated species. In
   order to fill this knowledge gap, we studied the characteristics of
   selected foraging substrates and the foraging behavior of the Three-toed
   Woodpecker during the breeding season in unburned forests and forests
   that have been subjected to prescribed burning. We used instantaneous
   sampling during two consecutive springs (2016-2017), where we observed
   the woodpeckers' foraging behavior during a total of 977 minutes in
   burned forest and 962 minutes in unburned forests. The preferred
   foraging substrate for Three-toed Woodpeckers in both burned and
   unburned forests can be characterized as freshly dead trees with a DBH >
   15 cm. However, data on time spent foraging on different substrates
   suggest that also substrates in the 5-15 DBH range and living trees are
   important. Additionally, prescribed burnings led to less pronounced
   selection of tree species, which suggest that fire may reduce
   differences in abundance of saproxylic insect prey between tree species.
   This information on substrate selection and foraging time provide
   complementary knowledge and thus should be used simultaneously when
   management strategies for improved woodpecker habitat are developed. Our
   results suggest that both prescribed burning and protecting forests with
   high density and diversity of dead wood provides habitat opportunities
   for Three-toed Woodpeckers and using both in management may maximize
   conservation outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Many ecologically important, five-needle white pine forests that
   historically dominated the high elevation landscapes of western North
   America are now being heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus spp.) outbreaks, the exotic disease white pine blister
   rust (WPBR), and altered high elevation fire regimes. Management
   intervention using specially designed strategic treatments will be
   needed to conserve these keystone species. The goal of this intervention
   is to promote self-sustaining five-needle white pine ecosystems that
   have both resilience to disturbances and genetic resistance to white
   pine blister rust. Many tools and methods are available for land
   managers. In this paper we outline important steps for implementation of
   restoration treatments in declining high elevation white pine stands and
   discuss a number of proactive treatments in threatened ecosystems to
   mitigate adverse impacts of rust, beetles, and lack of fire. These steps
   for restoration include (1) create a strategy for restoration across
   multiple scales, (2) develop materials and techniques for conducting
   restoration treatments, such as seed collections and rust resistance
   assessments of the genetic material, (3) prioritize stands or landscapes
   by integrating the strategy with other management issues, administrative
   barriers, climate change mitigation, and other local concerns, (4)
   implement silvicultural cuttings and prescribed fire according to
   landscape and stand level strategies, (5) conduct activities and
   assessments to enhance and ensure restoration treatments are effective
   including planting rust-resistant pine seedlings and protecting valuable
   seed-sources, and finally (6) monitor treated landscape and stands for
   effects and adjust and modify future treatment designs accordingly.
   Examples from whitebark pine ecosystems in the northern Rocky Mountains
   will be presented to demonstrate this process. For those high elevation
   white pine ecosystems that are threatened by white pine blister rust or
   mountain pine beetle, there are actions that can be taken proactively to
   gain necessary information to evaluate risk and prepare landscapes for
   invasion to mitigate future impacts. The proactive strategy includes:
   (1) educate and engage the public and managers to shift from crisis
   management to management for resiliency, (2) conserve genetic diversity
   from native populations before they are impacted by WPBR or other
   stresses, (3) conduct research on patterns, processes and responses of
   native ecosystems to provide process level understanding of ecosystem
   behavior and (4) develop and conduct appropriate management activities
   to increase the resiliency of high elevation five-needle pine ecosystems
   to prepare them for change. Whether it is restoring impacted landscapes
   or interventions to mitigate the development of impacts on threatened
   landscapes, there are two important factors that will govern the success
   of these species even with comprehensive and effective rangewide
   strategies: (1) the magnitude of resources available over time to
   conduct restoration efforts, and (2) the commitment of natural resource
   agencies to conduct restoration activities over the long term, most
   likely for many decades to centuries.}},

Abstract = {{The red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta (RIFA) is an invasive
   species found throughout the southern and southeastern United States.
   Since its introduction, RIFA has been shown to negatively affect a wide
   range of native vertebrate and invertebrate species. The purposes of
   this study were to delineate the annual RIFA activity pattern,
   investigate the association between overstory canopy cover and RIFA
   captures, and evaluate the effects of low-intensity prescribed fire
   around pond edges on RIFA in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas, a region
   that provides habitat for most of the remaining endangered Houston toads
   Bufo houstonensis. We found that annual RIFA activity followed a
   quadratic curve, with above-average activity between May and October. We
   found an inverse relationship between mean percentage of canopy cover
   near pond edges and mean number of RIFA captured. We found that
   low-intensity prescribed burning had no significant influence on RIFA
   captures during our study period. However, strong spatial and temporal
   capture variability was apparent, and thus a strong impact would have
   been necessary to detect an effect. Although this study provides
   evidence that should decrease concerns that wildlife managers,
   conservation biologists, and landowners in the Lost Pines ecoregion may
   have about exacerbating RIFA abundance when using fire as an ecosystem
   management tool, we recommend additional work be conducted using a
   greater sample size, greater sampling effort, and longer study duration.
   We found that RIFA activity was highest during the time frame in which
   juvenile Houston toads emerge from ponds. Thus, RIFA control may be a
   useful Houston toad recovery tool where breeding ponds are not within
   dense canopy habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Pine forests managed for economic return comprise 19\% of southeastern
   U.S. forests and can provide vegetation structure and composition
   necessary for many wildlife species adapted to open pine conditions.
   However, in the absence of frequent fire and other disturbance in
   southeastern pine (Pinus spp.) forests, midstory hardwoods create closed
   canopy conditions limiting value of pine stands for many endemic,
   disturbance-adapted wildlife species. Limitations of past research
   investigating exact mechanisms for producing and maintaining open pine
   conditions in managed pine systems have led to a paucity of information
   regarding ecoregion applications and outcomes. This study evaluated (1)
   to what extent managed pine stands replicate open pine structural
   conditions and (2) to what extent managed pine stands provide habitat
   for the gopher tortoise, an open pine keystone species. We used summary
   statistics from existing literature to identify structural metrics
   provided by managed loblolly pine (P. taeda) stands and compared them to
   disturbance-maintained open pine woodlands. We used spatially-explicit
   forest management simulations to determine amount and configuration of
   open pine woodland conditions within two large (> 9000 ha),
   economically-feasible managed pine landscapes in the East and West Gulf
   Coastal Plains ecoregions. As a case study, we estimated availability
   and connectivity of gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) habitat, in
   managed pine stands of the East Gulf Coastal Plains. Pine stands planted
   at <= 1310 stems/ha (<= 530 stems/ac) provide up to four years of
   ``excellent{''} open pine condition for wildlife following commercial
   thinning, based on desired conditions for southern pine forests, with
   temporal availability depending on site quality. Mid-rotation
   applications of prescribed fire and selective herbicide can extend
   ``excellent{''} open pine condition initiated by commercial thinning up
   to an additional four years. Landscape metrics indicated that, under
   typical management practices, open pine stands can be spatially and
   temporally connected to the extent necessary to facilitate among-patch
   movement for many open pine-adapted species of conservation concern. Our
   landscape analyses indicated tortoises using primarily regenerating and
   thinned stands potentially can have a relatively even flow of suitable
   habitat conditions and opportunities to move to adjacent or nearby open
   stands when currently-occupied stands reach canopy closure. The
   disturbance regimes inherent in pine plantation management create
   diverse landscapes that conserve plant and wildlife biodiversity while
   meeting economic objectives. Therefore, pine plantations may complement
   current conservation efforts for open pine woodland species dependent on
   or tolerant of large-scale disturbance and shifting habitat conditions
   while offering refuge for high vagility species.}},

Abstract = {{Two prominent mechanisms proposed to structure biodiversity are
   niche-based ecological filtering and chance arrival of propagules from
   the species pool. Seed arrival is hypothesized to play a particularly
   strong role in high-diversity plant communities with large potential
   species pools and many rare species, but few studies have explored how
   seed arrival and local ecological filters interactively assemble
   species-rich communities in space and time. We experimentally
   manipulated seed arrival and multiple ecological filters in
   high-diversity, herbaceous-dominated groundcover communities in longleaf
   pine savannas, which contain the highest small-scale species richness in
   North America (up to >40 species/m(2)). We tested three hypotheses: (1)
   local communities constitute relatively open-membership assemblages, in
   which increased seed arrival from the species pool strongly increases
   species richness; (2) ecological filters imposed by local fire intensity
   and soil moisture influence recruitment and richness of immigrating
   species; and (3) ecological filters increase similarity in the
   composition of immigrating species. In a two-year factorial field
   experiment, we manipulated local fire intensity by increasing pre-fire
   fuel loads, soil moisture using rain shelters and irrigation, and seed
   arrival by adding seeds from the local species pool. Seed arrival
   increased species richness regardless of fire intensity and soil
   moisture but interacted with both ecological filters to influence
   community assembly. High-intensity fire decreased richness of resident
   species, suggesting an important abiotic filter. In contrast,
   high-intensity fire increased recruitment and richness of immigrating
   species, presumably by decreasing effects of other ecological filters
   (competition and resource limitation) in postfire environments. Drought
   decreased recruitment and richness of immigrating species, whereas wet
   soil conditions increased recruitment but decreased or had little effect
   on richness. Moreover, some ecological filters (wet soil conditions and,
   to a lesser extent, high-intensity fire) increased similarity in the
   composition of immigrating species, illustrating conditions that
   influence deterministic community assembly in species-rich communities.
   Our experiment provides insights into how dispersal-assembly mechanisms
   may interact with niche-assembly mechanisms in space (spatial variation
   in disturbance) and time (temporal variation in resource availability)
   to structure high-diversity communities and can help guide conservation
   of threatened longleaf pine ecosystems in the face of habitat
   fragmentation and environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Mismatches between invasive species management policies and ecological
   knowledge can lead to profound societal consequences. For this reason,
   natural resource agencies have adopted the scientifically-based
   density-impact invasive species curve to guide invasive species
   management. We use the density-impact model to evaluate how well
   management policies for a native invader (Juniperus virginiana) match
   scientific guidelines. Juniperus virginiana invasion is causing a
   sub-continental regime shift from grasslands to woodlands in central
   North America, and its impacts span collapses in endemic diversity,
   heightened wildfire risk, and crashes in grazing land profitability. We
   (1) use land cover data to identify the stage of Juniperus virginiana
   invasion for three ecoregions within Nebraska, USA, (2) determine the
   range of invasion stages at individual land parcel extents within each
   ecoregion based on the density-impact model, and (3) determine policy
   alignment and mismatches relative to the density-impact model in order
   to assess their potential to meet sustainability targets and avoid
   societal impacts as Juniperus virginiana abundance increases. We found
   that nearly all policies evidenced doublethink and policy-ecology
   mismatches, for instance, promoting spread of Juniperus virginiana
   regardless of invasion stage while simultaneously managing it as a
   native invader in the same ecoregion. Like other invasive species,
   theory and literature for this native invader indicate that the
   consequences of invasion are unlikely to be prevented if policies fail
   to prioritize management at incipient invasion stages. Theory suggests a
   more realistic approach would be to align policy with the stage of
   invasion at local and ecoregion management scales. There is a need for
   scientists, policy makers, and ecosystem managers to move past
   ideologies governing native versus non-native invader classification and
   toward a framework that accounts for the uniqueness of native species
   invasions, their anthropogenic drivers, and their impacts on ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest birds have adapted to changes caused by natural
   disturbances such as fire and this adaptation forms the basis for the
   Natural Disturbance Paradigm (NDP) underlying recent proposed changes in
   forest harvesting practices in western Canada. To date, this paradigm
   has been evaluated primarily at the stand level and within conventional
   harvesting systems. The potential for improvements in avian conservation
   at the landscape scale by adopting the NDP approach is largely unknown.
   We examined the effects of landscape-scale disturbances on forest bird
   communities by contrasting richness and abundance of birds in (1) 16
   single-pass harvest sites with residual forest patches, (2) 29
   multi-pass harvest sites with residuals; and (3) 15 salvage-logged
   post-fire sites with variable harvest intensity. We contrasted bird
   communities in these treatments with those in unsalvaged post-fire sites
   of similar age. Post-fire sites were used to provide a metric of the
   Natural Range of Variation (NRV) to be expected in bird communities.
   Sites were surveyed for avian community composition and abundance 1-5
   years post-disturbance. Redundancy analysis indicated that bird
   communities differed from the NRV in all of the harvest treatments.
   However, single-pass harvests provided a somewhat better fit to NRV than
   did multipass harvesting. Avian community similarity was influenced by
   non-linear responses to area harvested, amount of residual retention,
   residual composition and pre-disturbance forest composition. An
   optimization routine created from a General Linear Model, suggests that
   community similarity to NRV can be maximized by using single-pass
   harvests over multi-pass harvests, harvesting 66-88\% of the timber in
   the planning unit, and retaining 5-19\% of the disturbance area as live
   residual patches, with 50\% of harvests having at least 9\% of the area

Abstract = {{Ecological fire management in Australia is often built on an assumption
   that meeting the needs of plant species will automatically meet the
   needs of animal species. However, the scarcity of ecological data on the
   needs of fauna in relation to fire undermines the confidence managers
   should place in current popular frameworks for planning ecological
   burning. Such frameworks are built almost entirely around the goal of
   maintaining plant community diversity. They provide little guidance to
   managers regarding the characteristics of desirable `mosaics' (e.g.
   patch size, connectivity or composition of age-since-burnt classes) or
   the timing of fires in relation to faunal population trends linked to
   other cycles (e.g. El Nino events). Claims by agencies of adopting an
   adaptive management approach ('learning by doing') to cope with a dearth
   of knowledge are credible only if monitoring and evaluation are carried
   out and future actions are modified in light of new evidence.Much
   monitoring of fauna is of such a small scale and short duration that the
   statistical likelihood of detecting a positive or negative effect of the
   management regime is minute.Such shortcomings will only be overcome
   through broad-scale and/or long-term studies of fauna. The funding for
   such research is unlikely to be forthcoming if fire ecologists and land
   managers convey the impression that the current data are adequate for
   the implementation of the current planning frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction has resulted in the fragmented distribution of
   numerous terrestrial species, which poses a challenge for

   compounded by life history constraints such as low dispersal, hindering
   the ability of species to recolonize areas they formerly occupied. For
   these species, a thorough understanding of the local threats and factors
   that limit their distribution is crucial for effective management. We
   used occupancy models to examine which factors at landscape and habitat
   scales (i.e. land uses, fire history, and vegetation structure) explain
   the presence of terrestrial tortoises within the range of the
   westernmost isolated population of the endangered Testudo hermanni
   hermanni in the Albera Range (NE of the Iberian Peninsula). We randomly
   surveyed 25 sites (75\% of the area known with presence of tortoises) of

   From a sampling effort of 148 hours, we only detected 52 tortoises in 12
   of 25 transects. These low numbers are evidence of low population
   densities. Sites with presence of tortoises were spatially aggregated
   although the species was absent from apparently adequate sites on the
   edges of its distribution range. Current and historic land-use primarily
   explained the presence of tortoises. Besides, wildfires and reduction of

Abstract = {{Wildlife managers use spring prescribed burns to set back succession in
   managed grasslands throughout the prairie pothole region. Yet,
   prescribed burns are expensive and weather dependent. Autumn biomass
   harvest of native prairie plants may also simulate natural disturbances
   and help prevent the invasion of woody species. As such, biomass harvest
   can be an attractive management option that can augment, and in some
   cases, replace spring burning programs. We compared vegetation
   characteristics (vegetation ht and density, and residual litter depth)
   and changes to the plant community (e.g., species richness, relative
   abundance of native and exotic plant species) in restored native
   grasslands of Minnesota, during 2007-2009, in response to spring
   prescribed burns and autumn biomass harvest. We used a randomized block
   design to control for site-to-site variability, and compared treatments
   using mixed models that accounted for this source of variation as well
   as within-plot repeated measures. This framework also allowed us to
   consider additional variables (e.g., Julian date, yr effects) thought to
   influence response patterns, and also additional fields that were
   treated with an autumn biomass harvest during the same time period.
   Vegetation characteristics exhibited substantial site-to-site and
   temporal variability, but, with the exception of litter depths,
   vegetation characteristics were largely similar in biomass harvest and
   burned subplots. We conclude that autumn biomass harvests deserve more
   consideration as a potential grassland management tool. (C) 2013 The

Title = {{Response of African savanna ants to long-term fire regimes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{1. Despite the fact that fire is considered an important disturbance in
   savannas across the world and is used widely as a management tool in
   conservation areas, little is known about the effects of burning on
   their insect communities.
   2. This study made use of a 50-year fire experiment to investigate the
   responses of ant assemblages to long-term burning regimes. The effects
   of fire frequency, season and time since fire (fuel age) were tested on
   epigaeic ants across three savanna vegetation types (Mopane woodland,
   Acacia savanna and Terminalia woodland) in Kruger National Park, South
   Africa.
   3. There was no significant effect of burning on mean ant species
   richness and abundance between treatments, although there were
   significant differences in ant assemblage composition between burned
   (treatment) and unburned (control) plots. The effects of season,
   frequency of burn and plot age on assemblage structure were weak and
   often not significant.
   4. Epigaeic ant assemblages in this savanna system appeared to be highly
   resistant and resilient to burning. The response of ants to fire was
   linked to changes in habitat cover and structure: the effect of fire on
   vegetation and ants was less pronounced in lower rainfall areas, where
   differences in vegetation structure between burnt and unburnt plots were
   less pronounced than in higher rainfall areas.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The effect of fire on ant assemblages in
   the mid- to northern Kruger National Park depends on whether a patch
   burns or not, rather than the specifics of the burning treatment. Thus,
   conservation managers can focus concerns regarding the subtleties of
   fire regimes on other taxa or areas of particular concern.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire recovery of arid shrublands is typically slow, and planting
   greenhouse-raised seedlings may be a means of jump-starting this
   process. Recovery can be further accelerated by understanding the
   factors controlling post-planting survival. In fall 2007 and 2009, we
   outplanted seedlings of two contrasting native evergreen
   shrubs-fast-growing Nevada jointfir and slow-growing blackbrush-across
   five burned sites in the Mojave Desert. To increase soil moisture and
   optimize seedling survival, we experimentally applied and evaluated soil
   amendments and supplemental watering. We also evaluated two herbicides
   that reduce competitive invasive annual grasses and two types of
   herbivore protection. Survival of jointfir outplanted in 2007 was 61\%
   after 43 months, and site largely influenced survival, while herbicide
   containing imazapic applied more than one year after outplanting reduced
   survival. Reduced survival of jointfir outplanted in 2009 coincided with
   delayed seasonal precipitation that intensified foliar damage by small
   mammals. In contrast, blackbrush survival was 4\% after 43 months, and
   was influenced by site, type of herbivore protection, and greenhouse
   during the 2007 outplanting, and soil amendment during 2009. Counter to
   expectations, we found that supplemental watering and soil amendments
   did not influence long-term survival of either blackbrush or jointfir.
   Shrub species with rapid growth rates and broad environmental
   tolerances, such as jointfir, make ideal candidates for outplanting,
   provided that seedlings are protected from herbivores. Re-introduction
   of species with slow growth rates and narrow environmental tolerances,
   such as blackbrush, requires careful consideration to optimize pre- and
   post-planting conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Historical forests in the Southeastern Mixed Forest province of the
   United States have been less researched than other regions using
   historical tree surveys. We used 81,000 tree records from surveys during
   the 1800s to quantify composition of this ecological province. Upland
   oaks and pines comprised about 75\% of all trees, with relatively equal
   composition. Oak composition may have comprised >= 45\% to the northern
   and eastern sides of the province. Hickories were about 10\% of
   composition and a few species were present at 1\% to 2\% composition.
   Currently, pine has increased to 49\% composition; loblolly pine was
   46\% of all trees. Upland oaks decreased to 8\% composition. Paralleling
   other historically oak- or pine-dominated regions, fire-intolerant
   species increased to 40\% of composition, particularly
   early-successional sweetgum. Historical oak-pine forests mostly have
   converted to loblolly pine plantations and broadleaf forests in this
   region. A large extent of the eastern United States historically was
   dominated by oak or pine forests, which likely were open old growth
   forests due to a frequent, low-to-moderate severity fire regime that
   reduced tree densities and infrequently disturbed overstory trees. Open
   old growth forests should be recognized as distinct ecosystems with
   unique characteristics, ecological functioning, and associated
   management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Many western conifer forests were historically affected by frequent,
   low- to mixed-severity fires. A legacy of fire suppression, logging,
   grazing and other factors has created current forest habitats that do
   not reflect historical conditions. The increasing size, severity, and
   costs of catastrophic forest wildfires are now focusing wildland
   management and research towards proactive fuel treatments designed to
   reduce fire hazards across landscapes. As part of the National Fire and
   Fire Surrogate (FFS) study, we researched the effects of three fuel
   treatments on small mammal populations within Sierra Nevada
   mixed-conifer forests. Twelve mixed-conifer stands were selected
   randomly from a set of available stands. Each stand was assigned to one
   of four treatment groups: controls, prescribed fire only, mechanical
   only, and mechanical plus fire combined. Abundance of California ground
   squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi), long-eared chipmunks (Tamias
   quadrimaculatus), brush mice (Peromyscus boylii), and deer mice
   (Peromyscus maniculatus) were monitored both pre- and post-treatment.
   Only the deer mouse had a significant treatment effect. Deer mice
   abundance significantly increased from pre- to post-treatment within
   fire only and mechanical plus fire treatments, and declined within
   mechanical only treatments. All four species had a significant effect of
   year, with higher overall abundance in the post-treatment period. In
   addition to the experimental analysis, models containing stand-level
   covariates of vegetation and fuel characteristics were examined and
   compared using model selection procedures. The models only improved upon
   the experimental analysis for the brush mouse. Brush mice were found to
   have a positive association with stand-level canopy cover. Our results
   suggest that burning had a positive effect on deer mice and that
   mechanical only treatments had a negative effect. For the other three
   species, the dominant effect of year suggests that other, more regional
   factors may have affected abundance. Possible explanations included an
   increase in precipitation from pre- to post-treatment, a major cone crop
   in 2002, and a major decline in gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus)
   occurrence. For the brush mouse, an evaluation of trap locations within
   stands indicates that this species was associated with dense clumps of
   tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) or riparian areas. Leaving areas of
   dense low vegetation cover may benefit this species where fuel reduction
   treatments are implemented. Our study only documented the immediate
   impacts of fuel treatments and more research is needed to determine if
   our results will persist through time. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Context Effective conservation planning for species depends on
   vegetation models that can capture the dynamics of habitat elements

   at landscape scales is essential for understanding the impact of natural
   disturbance, management, and climate change on habitat availability and
   stability on fauna. Objectives To explore the impact of resource
   availability, wildfire, forest management (timber harvesting and planned
   burning), and climate change on the habitat of the critically endangered
   Leadbeater's possum (LBP; Gymnobelideus leadbeateri McCoy) with the goal
   of understanding the importance of these factors on future habitat
   availability. Methods We used a spatially explicit landscape-simulation
   model, LANDIS-II, linked to habitat suitability and patch modelling, to
   identify quantity, configuration, and temporal stability of habitat for
   LBP. We used boosted regression trees and general additive modelling to
   explore the importance of management and disturbance factors on future
   LBP habitat availability. Results Wildfire was the main factor
   determining all habitat components for LBP, both alone and in
   interaction with climate change and forest management. We identified
   stable habitat patches that will likely persist under future conditions,
   and that might be prioritised for conservation in a dynamic landscape.
   Conclusions We highlight how the current reserve network could be
   augmented to improve the future conservation status of LBP. Our approach

Abstract = {{Climate influences natural processes at multiple spatial and temporal

   evaluation of the adaptive capacity of forest management under changing

   Adaptation begins by reinterpreting current practices dealing with

   regeneration enhancement can contribute to coping with some impacts of
   climate change. However, there is an increasing need to develop more
   integrative and spatially explicit management strategies to decrease the

   developing management strategies, such as fuel management or the triad
   approach (zoning system for conservation, intensive, and extensive
   forest management), present an interesting potential for integrating the
   fire risk in management plans. While fuel management and fire
   suppression are indicated for particularly severe fire regimes,
   protection against insects, and maintaining a shorter disturbance cycle

Abstract = {{Fire is a natural feature of many ecosystems, with some vegetation types
   highly adapted to fire. However, very little is known about the effect
   of fire on spiders, especially as fires have become more frequent owing
   to human activity. We determine whether different spider functional
   guilds (web builders vs. wanderers) respond differently to fires in the
   sclerophyllous fynbos. We determine also the effect of rockiness as
   refuge for these guilds and whether it influences their post-fire
   recovery. There were three site categories of time-since-last fire: 3
   months, 1 year, and 7 years. We found that fire caused a decline in
   spider richness and abundance, with the 3-month category supporting the
   lowest. In sites that were burned within 1 year, abundance of wanderers
   was as high as in sites that had 7 years to recover, whereas species
   richness and abundance of web builders in sites that were burned 1 year
   ago were as low as in recently burned sites. However, assemblages of
   wanderers differed among categories, while no differences were observed
   for web builders, highlighting that wanderers took longer time to
   recover than web builders. Species richness and abundance of both guilds
   were not affected by different levels of rockiness. However, rockiness
   is important in shaping assemblages of wanderers. The results emphasize
   that the assemblages of greatest conservation concern with increased
   fire frequencies are wanderers and are candidate surrogates for
   monitoring post-fire recovery. These results highlight the need to allow
   fynbos vegetation to recover fully between fire intervals and draws
   attention to the dangers of frequent unplanned fires.}},

Abstract = {{Several large, uncharacteristic wildfires occurred on the Boise National
   Forest in Southwest Idaho, from 1986 to 2003. From 1987 to 1994, severe
   wildfires burned almost 50\% of the ponderosa pine forest types (about
   200,000 ha). The intensity of the fires varied across the landscape,
   with a mix of low to moderate severity, and lesser amounts of high burn
   severity. After the fires, localized debris flows favored smaller order
   streams in watersheds less than 4000 ha in size, where there had been
   mostly high severity burning. Locally, areas experiencing high heat and
   post-fire debris flows had reduced fish numbers and altered fish
   habitats. Uncharacteristic wildfires on the managed portions of the
   Boise National Forest appeared to have more pronounced, short-term
   effects on fish habitats as compared with characteristic wildfires in
   the Central Idaho Wilderness. Even in the most severely impacted
   streams, habitat conditions and trout populations improved dramatically
   within 5-10 years. Post-fire floods apparently rejuvenated stream
   habitats by exporting fine sediments and by importing large amounts of
   gravel, cobble, woody debris, and nutrients, resulting in higher fish
   productivities than before the fire. These observations suggest that
   important elements of biodiversity and fish productivity may be
   influenced, or even created by fire-related disturbances. In some cases,
   habitats that were completely devoid of salmonid fishes just after the
   debris floods, were later re-colonized with migrants returning from
   downstream or nearby tributary rearing habitats. Re-population was
   likely enhanced by higher fecundity, homing instinct, and greater
   mobility of the larger migratory fish. Ecosystem restoration activities
   that reduce both short- and long-term threats of uncharacteristic
   wildfire on imperiled fishes could be emphasized in areas where local
   populations may be weak and/or isolated, but potentially recoverable.
   But forest ecosystem restoration alone may not reduce risks to fish if
   existing habitat conditions and isolation are limiting the population.

Abstract = {{Despite inhabiting fire-adapted grasslands and shrublands across much of
   their continental distribution, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus,
   hereafter bobwhite) behavior relative to disturbance (e.g., fire) is
   poorly understood, especially in the western fringe of their

   dormant season burning (January-March 2013-2014) in a sand shinnery oak
   (Quercus havardii, hereafter shinnery oak) plant community. We captured
   and radio-marked bobwhites (n = 369) and monitored them via
   radiotelemetry across burn treatments (averaging 254 ha) ranging from 0
   to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, and > 36 months post fire (hereafter, time
   since fire {[}TSF]) at the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area in
   western Oklahoma, United States. Mean covey home range size was 76.6 ha
   +/- 5.9 {[}SE] (range; 12 - 270 ha) (n = 61 coveys), which is
   substantially larger than covey home ranges reported for other regions.
   Prescribed fire affected space use of coveys (F-4,F- 54 = 2.95, P <
   0.05), which was driven by smaller home range sizes of coveys using 25 -
   36 TSF (52.07 ha {[}+/- 6.6]) than 0 - 12 (85.0 ha {[}+/- 15.53]), 13 -
   24 (86.7 ha {[}+/- 20.7]) and > 36 TSF (78.9 ha {[}+/- 6.54]).
   Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that neither spring
   dispersal (movements or area traversed) were correlated with TSF, age,
   or sex (n = 114), further demonstrating a minimal effect of prescribed
   fire; however, dispersal areas were greater in 2013 than in 2014 (P <
   0.05). Our research shows that prescribed fire applied at a landscape
   scale had limited effects on short-term bobwhite movement and space use.
   These findings also suggest that in shinnery oak vegetation communities
   land managers can use prescribed fire across large spatial extents
   without substantially altering the space use or movement of bobwhites.

   as part of stepwise multiple linear regressions for each of 15
   specialist and 12 grassland species. Most specialists showed
   significantly increased numbers associated with less frequent and/or
   less intrusive managements. However, leaving habitat entirely unmanaged
   was rarely optimal. Single occasional wildfires were typically more
   favorable for specialist abundance than regular rotational burning,
   which often produced very low numbers. Mechanical cutting appeared more
   favorable than grazing. No management type was clearly favorable for all
   specialists of a given habitat. The grassland species tended to respond
   similarly to the specialists except that several favored more frequent
   and/or more intrusive management and that mechanical cutting was not
   markedly better for their abundance than grazing, nor wildfire than
   rotational burning. For conserving specialist butterflies, both
   consistency of management type within site and deliberate differences in
   management type among sites of like habitat is desirable. (C) 1997

   experiment. The spatially explicit, ecological process model FireBGCv2
   was used to simulate whitebark pine populations on two U.S. Northern
   Rocky Mountain landscapes over 95 years under two climate, three
   restoration, and two fire management scenarios. Major findings were that
   (1) whitebark pine can remain on some high mountain landscapes in a
   future climate albeit at lower basal areas (50\% decrease), (2)
   restoration efforts, such as thinning and prescribed burning, are vital
   to ensure future whitebark pine forests, and (3) climate change impacts
   on whitebark pine vary by local setting. Whitebark pine restoration
   efforts will mostly be successful in the future but only if future
   populations are somewhat resistant to WPBR. Results were used to develop
   general guidelines that address climate change impacts for planning,
   designing, implementing, and evaluating fine-scale restoration
   activities.}},

   vegetation types that are fire-prone. Dotted within this landscape are

   to vernal pools are anostracan crustaceans that survive the pool's dry
   period as encysted embryos. We hydrated anostracan cysts from the soil
   of a recently burned pool and from soil samples intentionally burned in
   a prescribed fire. We also sampled burned pools when refilled the next
   rainy season. We found that anostracan cysts in the soil can survive
   fire and that shrimp occur in pools in the first post-burn season. This

Abstract = {{The nematode communities in spruce forests were compared with the
   short-term effects of forest damage, caused by windstorm, wildfire and
   management practices of forest soils. Soil samples were collected in
   June and October from 2006 to 2008 in four different sites: (1) forest
   unaffected by the wind (REF); (2) storm-felled forest with salvaged
   timber (EXT); (3) modified forest affected by timber salvage (wood
   removal) and forest fire (FIR); and (4) storm-felled forest where timber
   had been left unsalvaged (NEX). Nematode analysis showed that the
   dominant species in all four investigated sites were Acrobeloides nanus
   and Eudorylaimus silvaticus. An increase of A. nanus (35\% of the total
   nematode abundance) in the first year in the FIR site led to the highest
   total abundance of nematodes compared with other sites, where nematode
   abundance reached the same level in the third year. In the FIR site
   bacterial feeders appeared to be the most representative trophic group,
   although in the second and third year, after disturbance, the abundance
   of this trophic group gradually decreased. In the NEX site, the number
   of nematode species, population densities and Maturity Index were
   similar to that recorded for the FIR site. In EXT and NEX sites, the
   other dominant species was the plant parasitic nematode Paratylenchus
   microdorus. Analyses of nematodes extracted from different forest soil
   samples showed that the highest number of species and diversity index
   for species (H'spp) were in the REF site. Differences between the
   nematode fauna in REF and other localities were clearly depicted by
   cluster analysis. The greatest Structure Index and Enrichment Index
   values were also in REF. In the EXT site, the number of nematode
   species, their abundance, H'spp and Maturity Index were not
   significantly different from those recorded in the reference site.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of natural and human disturbances on forest
   biota is critical for improving forest management. Many studies have
   examined the separate impacts on fauna and flora of wildfire,
   conventional logging, and salvage logging, but empirical comparisons
   across a broad gradient of simultaneous disturbances are lacking. We
   quantified species richness and frequency of occurrence of vascular
   plants, and functional group responses, across a gradient of
   disturbances that occurred concurrently in 2009 in the mountain ash
   forests of southeastern Australia. Our study encompassed replicated
   sites in undisturbed forest (similar to 70 yr post fire), forest burned
   at low severity, forest burned at high severity, unburned forest that
   was clearcut logged, and forest burned at high severity that was
   clearcut salvage logged post-fire. All sites were sampled 2 and 3 yr
   post fire. Mean species richness decreased across the disturbance
   gradient from 30.1 species/site on low-severity burned sites and 28.9
   species/site on high-severity burned sites, to 25.1 species/site on
   clearcut sites and 21.7 species/site on salvage logged sites.
   Low-severity burned sites were significantly more species-rich than
   clearcut sites and salvage logged sites; high-severity burned sites
   supported greater species richness than salvage logged sites. Specific
   traits influenced species' sensitivity to disturbance. Resprouting
   species dominated undisturbed mountain ash forests, but declined
   significantly across the gradient. Fern and midstory trees decreased
   significantly in frequency of occurrence across the gradient. Ferns
   (excluding bracken) decreased from 34\% of plants in undisturbed forest
   to 3\% on salvage logged sites. High-severity burned sites supported a
   greater frequency of occurrence and species richness of midstory trees
   compared to clearcut and salvage logged sites. Salvage logging supported
   fewer midstory trees than any other disturbance category, and were
   distinctly different from clearcut sites. Plant life form groups,
   including midstory trees, shrubs, and ferns, were dominated by very few
   species on logged sites. The differences in biotic response across the
   gradient of natural and human disturbances have significant management
   implications, particularly the need to reduce mechanical disturbance
   overall and to leave specific areas with no mechanical disturbance
   across the cut area during logging operations, to ensure the persistence
   of resprouting taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has an important influence on the biota of Royal National Park and
   is a factor over which park managers exert some control. Fire management
   guidelines for biodiversity conservation are expressed as thresholds
   that define fire-regimes associated with elevated risks of extinction
   that management must aim to avoid. These thresholds strongly reflect
   fire-interval effects on fire-sensitive (non-resprouting) species. In
   contrast, the guidelines are less prescriptive about the characteristics
   of particular fire events (e. g. intensity, season, post-fire rainfall)
   or competition because the long-term importance of these factors is less
   well understood. On-going monitoring is required to determine if
   conservation goals will be met by management actions under these
   guidelines, or if they should be adapted to counter previously
   unidentified negative trends. In particular, populations of resprouting
   species which appear to be relatively resilient to interval-dependent
   effects must be monitored to detect subtle, but ultimately dangerous
   declines. We describe population trends in the iconic grass-tree
   Xanthorrhoea resinosa based on observations of over 3000 individual
   plants over a period of 23 years. We identify divergent population
   trends predicted to result in either local extinction within 200 years
   or slight declines depending on rates of mortality. Experimental
   evidence is presented for a strong impact of competition on survival
   which, at one of the study sites, led to local extinction following a
   single fire interval of 17 years. The relative importance of mortality
   associated with heat shock during fire, the effort of post-fire
   resprouting and flowering and other factors such as disease and
   competition are discussed. Our results suggest that a focus on minimum
   fire intervals alone will not guarantee the long-term persistence of key
   understorey species and that fire regime thresholds should more directly
   consider functional groups containing species with low potential for
   population growth.}},

Pages = {{587-593}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance can directly affect the interactions among species at
   different trophic levels. Because disturbances are typically localized,
   and many consumers are constrained in their mobility, disturbances can
   generate spatial variability in trophic interactions. Here, we consider
   how fire alters plant-insect interactions in a longleaf pine ecosystem
   in central Florida, USA. We hypothesized that fire in the short term
   would directly depress herbivore abundance, and that the rate of
   re-colonization by herbivores would depend upon distance from the edge
   of the recently burned area. Thus, fire should generate spatially
   varying herbivory. Orthopterans are dominant insect consumers in our
   system, and many species are flightless, either as juveniles or adults;
   these species are particularly likely to show constrained post-fire
   mobility. We quantified insect abundance and herbivory levels on eight
   common understory plants in the, edge and interior of three recently
   burned sites. As predicted, insect abundance at the edge of burned areas
   was much higher than in the interior. In addition, all plant species
   experienced at least twice the level of herbivory in the edge than in
   the interior of burned sites. This demonstrates that disturbance can
   create strong spatial variation in the magnitude of trophic
   interactions. We suggest that larger burns may aid in plant management
   by reducing herbivory, whereas the presence of unburned refugia may be
   critical to insect conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystems can change rapidly and sometimes irreversibly due to a number
   of anthropogenic and natural factors, such as deforestation and fire.
   How individual animals exposed to such changes respond behaviourally and
   physiologically is poorly understood. We quantified the phenotypic
   plasticity of activity patterns and torpor use - a highly efficient
   energy conservation mechanism - in brown antechinus (Antechinus
   stuartii), a small Australian marsupial Mammal. We compared groups in
   densely vegetated forest areas (pre-fire and control) with a group in a
   burned, open habitat (post-fire). Activity and torpor patterns differed
   among groups and sexes. Females in the post-fire group spent
   significantly less time active than the other groups, both during the
   day and night. However, in males only daytime activity declined in the
   post-fire group, although overall activity was also reduced on cold days
   in males for all groups. The reduction in total or diurnal activity in
   the post-fire group was made energetically possible by a similar to
   3.4-fold and similar to 2.2-fold increase in the proportion of time
   females and males, respectively, used torpor in comparison to that in
   the pre-fire and control groups. Overall, likely due to reproductive
   needs, torpor was more pronounced in females than in males, but low
   ambient temperatures increased torpor bout duration in both sexes.
   Importantly, for both male and female antechinus and likely other small
   mammals, predator avoidance and energy conservation - achieved by
   reduced activity and increased torpor use - appear to be vital for
   post-fire survival where ground cover and refuges have been obliterated.

Abstract = {{1 Although the season of fire occurrence is known to affect recruitment
   to plant populations, it has received little attention. This study
   investigated the dynamics of the canopy-stored seed banks of two
   Australian obligate seeder shrubs, Petrophile sessilis and Hakea sericea
   (Proteaceae), with the objective of determining the changes in viable
   seed supply over a year.
   2 The total number of germinable seeds in the canopy, each month for 12
   months during 1996-97, was estimated from separate measures of (i)
   pre-dispersal predation of fruits; (ii) seed predation of insect
   parasitoids; (iii) viability of intact seeds; and (iv) loss of seed
   viability following experimental heating.
   3 The two species had very different seed bank dynamics throughout the
   year. The seed store of P. sessilis appeared to be being replaced
   annually, as seeds in the older fruits rapidly lost germinability and
   new fruits matured to replace them. For H. sericea, the seed store
   appeared to be accumulating each year, because older fruits retained a
   high level of germinability.
   4 The study indicates that no one fire season will maximize the
   germinable seed release after fire for all species. Management
   strategies should therefore include varied seasons of prescribed burning
   to avoid compositional change and a decrease in diversity that may
   result from a single-season approach.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Habitat heterogeneity is a key driver of biodiversity in many
   ecosystems. Wildlife inhabiting the native prairies of North America
   evolved in a heterogeneous mosaic of habitat conditions created by fire
   and grazing by native ungulates. Current rangeland management practices
   in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem evenly distribute fire and grazing
   across management units and promote homogeneous habitat conditions.
   Patch-burn grazing is a rangeland management strategy that seeks to
   restore heterogeneity to rangelands via fire-grazing interactions. Our
   3.5-year study tested the effects of patch-burn grazing on habitat
   heterogeneity and small mammal community dynamics in the Flint Hills
   ecoregion of eastern Kansas. To study the ecological effects of
   patch-burn grazing, we sampled habitat conditions and the small mammal
   community. We assessed habitat conditions once each growing season in a
   negative control that was annually burned and grazed, a positive control
   that was burned every four years and ungrazed, and within each of three
   units of a patch-burn grazing experiment (PBG) managed with rotational
   fire. Habitat conditions were significantly different among treatments,
   and a principal components analysis showed that the patch-burn grazing
   treatment had higher canopy cover of forbs and habitat heterogeneity
   than our two control units. To sample the small mammal community, we
   conducted monthly live trapping of small mammals on two randomly located
   trap grids in each of our two controls and three units of our PBG
   treatment. Small mammal diversity was significantly higher in the
   patch-burn grazing treatment and in the positive control, vs. the
   negative control. Moreover, a canonical correspondence analysis showed
   that a fire-grazing interaction was the major driver structuring small
   mammal communities. Patch-burn grazing is an effective strategy for
   restoring heterogeneity to vegetative structure and composition, and can
   increase-biodiversity of small mammals in managed rangelands in the
   tallgrass prairie ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic disturbances could have different impacts on

   achieve biodiversity protection objectives. Using post-fire (20-90
   years) and post-clearcutting (20-70 years) forest chronosequences placed
   on similar sites, we examined which environmental factors are the main
   drivers of bryophyte community assembly in eastern Canadian boreal
   forests, using information on bryophyte life-history strategies
   (colonist: high reproductive effort but a short potential life span;
   perennial: low reproductive effort and a long potential life span) to
   interpret the resulting patterns. The fire origin stands were affected
   by high-severity fires followed by natural regeneration, whereas the
   clear-cut stands were regenerated through the advance regeneration
   present in the understory of the harvested stands. Our results indicate
   that by killing the existing mosses and baring the mineral soil, fire
   tends to decrease the cover of perennial species (such as Pleurozium
   scherberii) and increase the presence of colonist species compared with
   clear-cut. Overall species richness does not increase much in older
   stands, but some species that have been identified by previous studies
   as being more sensitive to management activities, such as liverworts,
   tend to be strongly associated with balsam fir basal area, which is
   higher in mature clear-cut origin stands. This tree species tends to be
   heavily affected by partial mortality events after >50 years (insect
   outbreaks, windthrow), which could accelerate the creation of
   heterogeneous canopy structure and generate a greater diversity of
   microhabitats suitable for sensitive bryophyte species. More research

Abstract = {{The management decisions of private landowners affect forest structure

   this case study we assessed barriers to both intentional and incidental

   owners in eastern Oregon, USA. In this context, incidental adaptations
   result from synergies between climate-adaptive forest management and
   actions motivated by goals such as wildfire mitigation, which landowners
   may prioritize regardless of concerns about climate change. Through
   semistructured interviews we used qualitative analyses to identify
   barriers to adaptation, including subjective (cognitive and
   experiential) and structural barriers (social, political, and economic)
   by comparing individual cases. Overall, we found that intentional
   climate change adaptation had low salience among participants, though a
   large majority of forest owners were active managers motivated by other
   goals, contributing to widespread incidental adaptation. We found that
   nonindustrial private forest owners who engaged in or considered
   intentional climate adaptation actions generally believed that
   anthropogenic climate change is occurring. Many respondents perceived
   local environmental change, notably reduced snowpack, but this was not
   associated with adaptive actions or intentions. The few participants who
   considered or implemented intentional climate adaptation actions
   generally had written forest management plans containing both forest
   inventories and specific management goals. Improving access to resources
   for forest management planning may enhance fire- and climate-smart
   forest management by facilitating scenario visioning and formalizing
   intentions. Although climate change beliefs were subjective barriers to
   intentional climate adaptation, many of the same structural barriers
   limited intentional and incidental adaptation. Place-based education,
   reliable funding mechanisms, and cooperative approaches among landowners
   may enhance adaptive capacity and promote the resilience of these

   following. pinyon-juniper mechanical reduction treatments. Thinning in
   April 2006 removed a mean of 92\% (+ 6.4\% SE) of live trees from
   treatment blocks. The avian guild most greatly influenced by mechanical
   thinning included pinyon-juniper obligate species. Species eliminated
   following mechanical thinning were Gray Vireo (Vireo vicinior) and
   Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater). while Chipping Sparrow (Spizella
   passerine) numbers were significantly reduced. Birds in the
   shrub-nesting guild, including the sagebrush specialist Brewer's Sparrow
   (Spizella breweri), and habitat generalists such as the Bushtit
   (Psaltriparius minimus). increased in relative abundance following
   treatment. We conclude that mechanical thinning within the Intermountain
   West has the potential for natural area managers to design treatments
   that can influence numbers of both pinyon-juniper and sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) steppe avian species.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous palm species of Paraguay are presented with data on their
   diversity, distribution, threats and conservation status. The Paraguayan
   palm flora consists of 23 native species in 11 genera, representing two
   of the five subfamilies recognized in the group. The palm distribution
   in the country is strongly related to the different ecoregions present
   in Paraguay, with number of species by ecoregion being as follow:
   Cerrado (18), Upper Parana Atlantic forest (6), Wet Chaco (4), Pantanal
   (2), and Dry Chaco (1). Half of the species display an acaulescent habit
   reflecting an interesting ecological adaptation to natural fires in the
   Cerrado. The alarming rate of habitat modification that the country is
   undergoing since 1940s has put palms under a high risk of extinction in
   the wild. A GIS model was used to calculate the extent of occurrence and
   the area of occupancy of the species in order to assess their
   conservation status applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria.
   This analysis shows that about 30\% of the species are threatened; one
   species is Critically Endangered, three of them are Endangered, and
   three are Vulnerable. One species (Acrocomia hassleri) is considered
   Near Threatened, 13 are Least Concern whereas two species are
   insufficiently known and therefore unable to be assessed. Important
   areas for palm conservation in Paraguay were identified, revealing the
   importance of the Amambay department. Conservation measures for the
   threatened species identified are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires across western North America have increased in number and size
   over the past three decades, and this trend will continue in response to
   further warming. As a consequence, the wildland-urban interface is
   projected to experience substantially higher risk of climate-driven
   fires in the coming decades. Although many plants, animals, and
   ecosystem services benefit from fire, it is unknown how ecosystems will
   respond to increased burning and warming. Policy and management have
   focused primarily on specified resilience approaches aimed at resistance
   to wildfire and restoration of areas burned by wildfire through fire
   suppression and fuels management. These strategies are inadequate to
   address a new era of western wildfires. In contrast, policies that
   promote adaptive resilience to wildfire, by which people and ecosystems
   adjust and reorganize in response to changing fire regimes to reduce
   future vulnerability, are needed. Key aspects of an adaptive resilience
   approach are (i) recognizing that fuels reduction cannot alter regional
   wildfire trends; (ii) targeting fuels reduction to increase adaptation
   by some ecosystems and residential communities to more frequent fire;
   (iii) actively managing more wild and prescribed fires with a range of
   severities; and (iv) incentivizing and planning residential development
   to withstand inevitable wildfire. These strategies represent a shift in
   policy and management from restoring ecosystems based on historical
   baselines to adapting to changing fire regimes and from unsustainable
   defense of the wildlandurban interface to developing fire-adapted
   communities. We propose an approach that accepts wildfire as an
   inevitable catalyst of change and that promotes adaptive responses by
   ecosystems and residential communities to more warming and wildfire.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{581-593}},
Abstract = {{Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) is threatened across its
   native range by an exotic fungal pathogen introduced within the last
   century. Mortality has been extensive, and projected potential range
   shifts based on impending climate change have revealed further pressures
   to survival and adaptation for this long-lived, high-elevation conifer.
   Quantifying genetic variation and the mating system of whitebark pine in
   its northern range provides a basis for effective conservation measures.
   Isozyme analysis of vegetative bud tissue revealed high expected
   heterozygosity (0.262), moderate population differentiation (F-ST =
   0.061) and highly significant correlations between observed
   heterozygosity and geographic variables (R-2 = 0.36, latitude; R-2 =
   0.30 longitude), supporting the hypothesis that this species recolonized
   its current northern range following glacial retreat from several
   refugia in the Washington and Oregon Cascades and in the northern
   Rockies. Mating system analysis based on simultaneous isozyme analyses
   of embryo and haploid megagametophyte tissues found relatively high
   levels of consanguineous mating and selfing for a conifer (t(m) = 0.73)
   within populations. Avian seed distribution by the Clark's nutcracker
   (Nucifragia columbiana Wilson) appears to be the overriding factor
   influencing genetic patterns: being a mutualistic seed disperser, caches
   comprised of related seeds develop into clumped stands with strong
   family substructure. While it is a critical wildlife habitat component,
   lack of commercial utilization has made in situ adaptation the primary
   conservation focus. Encouraging regeneration success and nutcracker
   caching by maintaining natural fire regimes will provide an
   ecosystem-based conservation solution; however, in the Rocky Mountains
   between 52degreesN and 47degreesN, disease-resistant individuals should
   be located and propagated in order to ensure long-term survival of the
   species in high pathogen hazard areas.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial vertebrates exhibit dynamic, positive interactions that form
   and dissolve under different circumstances, usually with multiple
   species as participants. Ecosystem engineers are important facilitators
   of other species because they cause physical changes in the environment
   that alter resource availability. Although a species can be associated
   with more than one partner, facilitators may not be interchangeable if
   they differ in abundance, behavioral characteristics, or interactions
   with other factors in ways that condition the outcome of the
   association. We examined interactions between burrowing owls (Athene
   cunicularia) and two burrowing mammals, hairy armadillos (Chaetophractus
   villosus) and plains vizcachas (Lagostomus maximus), and determined
   whether these ecosystem engineers are interchangeable for owls. We
   examined reproductive success for owls nesting in these mammal burrows,
   constructed a logistic regression model to identify habitat
   characteristics associated with owl nests, and examined the engineering
   activities of the mammals. Data on reproduction and habitat indicate
   that armadillos and vizcachas are not interchangeable for owls.
   Thirty-five percent of the nests in vizcacha burrows produced
   fledglings; no fledglings were produced from nests outside vizcachas
   colonies, even though owls nest successfully in armadillo burrows in
   other parts of Argentina. Vizcachas facilitate burrowing owls by
   construction of burrows and by producing open understory vegetation
   through herbivory. In contrast, armadillos do not alter vegetation, and
   their burrows are suitable for nest sites only when they occur in
   recently burned areas or areas maintained by anthropogenic disturbance.
   Our habitat model also suggests that fire plays a key role in
   maintaining owl populations because fire is the only natural process
   that reduces shrubs to the level required by owls. Current management
   practices of eradication of vizcachas and fire suppression in shrublands
   could have strong negative consequences for burrowing owls.}},

Abstract = {{No published data exist on responses of grassland passerines and their

   (1998-2000) on 5 prescribe-burned, mixed-grass prairie management units
   (range = 50-534 ha, each burned 3-6 times in the previous 10-20 years).
   All breeding passerine species characteristic of upland, northern
   mixed-grass prairie were common (> 10\% occurrence) during at least 1 of
   3 years on burned and grazed units, except Chestnut-collared Longspur
   (Calcarius ornatus), which was uncommon. Vegetation was generally
   shorter and sparser than that found on 4 nearby units treated by fire
   only (1999; density, visual obstruction, and height, all P < 0.01).
   Regardless, occurrences of individual bird species resembled those
   previously documented on prairie units at LNWR with similar fire
   histories but no grazing; however, Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)
   occurred 2.4 times more frequently on burned and grazed units studied.

Abstract = {{The current challenge in a context of major environmental changes is to
   anticipate the responses of species to future landscape and climate
   scenarios. In the Mediterranean basin, climate change is one the most
   powerful driving forces of fire dynamics, with fire frequency and impact
   having markedly increased in recent years. Species distribution
   modelling plays a fundamental role in this challenge, but better
   integration of available ecological knowledge is needed to adequately
   guide conservation efforts. Here, we quantified changes in habitat
   suitability of an early-succession bird in Catalonia, the Dartford
   Warbler (Sylvia undata), which is globally evaluated as Near Threatened
   in the IUCN Red List. We assessed potential changes in species
   distributions between 2000 and 2050 under different fire management and
   climate change scenarios, and described landscape dynamics using a
   spatially-explicit fire-succession model that simulates fire impacts in
   the landscape and post-fire regeneration (MEDFIRE model). Dartford
   Warbler occurrence data were acquired at two different spatial scales
   from: (1) the Atlas of European Breeding Birds (EBCC) and (2) the
   Catalan Breeding Bird Atlas (CBBA). Habitat suitability was modelled
   using five widely-used modelling techniques in an ensemble forecasting
   framework. Our results indicated considerable habitat suitability losses
   (ranging between 47 and 57 \% in baseline scenarios), which were
   modulated to a large extent by fire regime changes derived from fire
   management policies and climate changes. Such result highlighted the
   need for taking the spatial interaction between climate changes,
   fire-mediated landscape dynamics and fire management policies into
   account for coherently anticipating habitat suitability changes of
   early-succession bird species. We conclude that fire management programs
   need to be integrated into conservation plans to effectively preserve
   sparsely forested and early succession habitats and their associated
   species in the face of global environmental change.}},

Pages = {{37-44}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Ecologically sustainable forest management aims to maintain biodiversity
   values within managed forest ecosystems. A key habitat component within
   Australian forest ecosystems are hollow-bearing trees which are
   crucially important for fauna species requiring tree hollows for diurnal
   shelter and nesting. The effect of disturbance regimes, in particular
   logging and fire, on hollow dynamics is poorly understood. The aim of
   this study was to determine the relationships between logging intensity
   and fire frequency on hollow abundance and forest stand structural
   attributes in two different eastern Australian Eucalyptus forest types.
   We found that average stand tree diameter at breast height was
   negatively correlated to logging intensity. Logging intensity was
   negatively correlated with tree diameter at breast height (DBH), and the
   density of both hollow-bearing trees and hollows. Losses of
   hollow-bearing trees and hollows occurred through an interaction between
   logging intensity and fire frequency, resulting in an absence of
   recruitment of hollow trees. However in unlogged forest, fire was
   positively correlated to the density of hollows. Under a regime of
   frequent fire, in areas that have had some degree of logging activity, a
   net loss of hollows may occur. We recommend additional hollow
   recruitment trees be retained on logged sites in the future if no net
   losses of hollows are to occur in the future, or for wider unlogged
   buffers to be established adjacent to the cutting area. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Prior research has demonstrated that fire can be an important

   However, investigations of land-management techniques, such as
   prescribed fire, often overlook responses of local fauna, particularly
   the arthropods. In this study, we examined a previously unappreciated,
   although potentially important, component of fire ecology by asking,
   does the timing of prescribed burns alter community structure of
   arthropods? At a site in the Texas Hill Country, we used sweep-net
   sampling to collected arthropods from experimental plots that had been
   treated with a summer-burn or winter-burn regime. Summer-burn plots
   supported >170\% more individual arthropods than winter burns. Although
   overall diversity of arthropods did not significantly differ between
   treatments, there were significantly more carnivorous arthropods and
   marginally more herbivorous arthropods after fire in summer relative to
   fire in winter. Effects of timing were particularly strong for
   Cicadellidae (leaf hoppers) and Tetragnathidae (long-jawed spiders). Our
   results demonstrate that timing of prescribed fire can substantially
   alter composition of resident communities of arthropods. Furthermore,
   these data highlight the importance of examining composition of the

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Moist high-altitude grasslands in South Africa are renowned for high
   avifaunal diversity and are priority areas for conservation.
   Conservation management of these areas conflicts with management for
   other uses, such as intensive livestock agriculture, which requires
   annual burning and leads to heavy grazing. Recently the area has become
   target for water storage schemes and renewable electricity energy
   projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental
   factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order
   to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A
   particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in
   the eastern South African high-altitude grasslands. An area that had
   been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility
   that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set
   aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over
   in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little
   grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain
   avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence
   and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to
   monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the
   habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert
   bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species
   richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this
   new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models,
   to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between
   burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird
   species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we
   investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with
   species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only.
   Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover
   compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over
   time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other
   seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased
   over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer
   heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years.
   Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with
   grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds
   but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one
   hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null
   model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively
   correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude
   that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to
   higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and
   disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use
   combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to
   accommodates birds of various habitat needs.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal sandplains provide habitat for a suite of rare and endangered
   plant and wildlife species in the northeastern United States. These
   early successional plant communities were maintained by natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances including salt spray, fire, and livestock
   grazing, but over the last 150 years, a decrease in anthropogenic
   disturbance frequency and intensity has resulted in a shift towards
   woody shrub dominance at the expense of herbaceous taxa. This study
   quantified the effects of more than a decade of dormant season
   disturbance-based vegetation management (mowing and prescribed fire) on
   coastal sandplain plant community composition on Nantucket Island,
   Massachusetts, USA. We used time-series plant cover data from two
   similar sites to evaluate the effectiveness of disturbance management
   for restoring herbaceous species cover and reducing woody shrub
   dominance. Our results indicate that applying management outside of the
   peak of the growing season has not been effective in maintaining or
   increasing the cover of herbaceous species. While management activities
   resulted in significant (P < 0.01) increases in herbaceous species
   immediately after treatment, woody species recolonized and dominated
   treated sites within 3-years post treatment at the expense of graminoids
   and forbs. These results highlight the difficulties associated with
   directing ecological succession using disturbance-based management to
   maintain rare, herbaceous species in coastal sandplain systems that were
   once a prevalent landscape component under historically chronic
   anthropogenic disturbance. Further experimentation with growing season
   disturbance-based management and different combinations of management
   techniques could provide insights into management alternatives for
   maintaining herbaceous conservation targets in coastal sandplains.}},

   densities in early seral stages}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{473}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire is an important natural disturbance in western North American
   forests and has been increasing in prevalence and severity in recent
   decades. Post-fire salvage logging is a common practice, however, the
   impacts of salvage logging on wildlife are poorly understood. We studied
   populations of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) and red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in a post-fire and salvage-logged interior
   Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest on the Chilcotin Plateau,
   British Columbia, Canada. Snowshoe hare densities were low, but
   densities were highest in 8-9-year-old regenerating post-fire forests.
   Hares were mostly absent from 1 to 2-year-old post-fire forests.
   Salvage-logged areas were not used by snowshoe hares. Red squirrel
   detections were highest in mature forests, and squirrels were not
   present in post-fire salvage-logged habitat. Post-fire salvage logging
   removed live canopy trees required by both snowshoe hares and red
   squirrels. The large scale and intensity of post-fire salvage logging
   removes important regenerating post-fire habitat and has detrimental
   impacts on these important prey species, likely leading to consequences
   for avian and mammalian predators.}},

   in endangered heathlands of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa}},
Journal = {{ANTHROPOCENE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{81-93}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Ecological baselines are important in informing conservation management
   targets. Baselines can shift, however, depending on the timescale of
   observation. Using observations from the past few years or decades can
   give a misleading impression of the normal range of variability of an
   ecosystem, and the extent of recent human transformation.
   Palaeoecological techniques can track interacting effects of climate
   change and land-use on vegetation composition and fire regimes over
   decadal-millennial timescales, thereby informing ecologically possible
   management options.
   In the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa, European settlement and
   subsequent land transformation led to dramatic changes in land-cover.
   Ninety-six percent of Renosterveld, a highly diverse indigenous
   shrubland, has been transformed. Thus, appropriate management of
   remaining Renosterveld fragments is critical to biodiversity
   conservation in this endangered habitat. However, we know little of the
   Renosterveld landscapes before colonial settlement from the mid-17th
   century.
   This study used fossil pollen, coprophilous fungal spores and charcoal
   to track vegetation, herbivory and fire at centennial timescales in one
   of the few remaining Renosterveld fragments. Results showed that the
   current landscape at the study site is atypical compared with the
   long-term history of the site, with higher abundance of Renosterbos
   (Elytropappus rhinocerotis) and local fires and herbivory that reflect
   intensive utilisation beginning in the mid-20th century. Managing the
   integrity and composition of Renosterveld at this site according to a
   pre-colonial baseline will require lower levels of herbivory and less
   frequent fire.
   This study illustrates how palaeoecological techniques can inform
   conservation management and restoration targets. To accommodate
   uncertainties in future environmental change, we recommend an adaptive
   management approach, which incorporates palaeoecological analyses,
   burning and grazing experiments and long-term monitoring. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Managers, regulators, and the public are interested in the conservation
   of threatened, endangered, or iconic species. While snakes are not
   usually thought of as iconic, Pine Snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus) are
   an indicator species of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. In this paper we
   examine the threats Pine Snakes face, and measures undertaken to reduce
   these risks. Major threats include habitat loss, fragmentation,
   increasing numbers of predators, declining prey base, forest fires,
   poaching, off-road vehicles, and an increase of road traffic. Over the
   40 + y of our study, the largest disruptions to hibernacula and nests
   were by poachers and predators, while the highest mortality of snakes on
   the surface was a result of predation and road-kills. Poaching of adults
   is an important threat, but difficult to assess due to the secrecy of
   people illegally collecting snakes. Conservation measures include: (1)
   enforcing laws, regulations, and patrolling, (2) enhancing habitat for
   foraging, nesting and hibernation and use of cages or wire to protect
   nests in areas with high levels of predators, (3) accepting protocols
   for snake assessment prior to allowing development, (4) using clean
   clothing and equipment when entering snake areas (especially when fungal

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{439-448}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. The effects of prescribed fire on ant community structure were
   examined in a regenerating longleaf pine savanna in Florida, U.S.A. The
   presence of ants on 20, 10 x 10 m plots was determined by baiting every
   1-3 months from 18 months before a fire until 6 months afterwards.
   2. Expected species richness (based on rarefaction) and species density
   6 months post-fire were significantly lower than for the same month
   (September) 6 months before the fire.
   3. Cluster analysis revealed that the effects of fire were far less
   important predictors of ant community structure than seasonality and
   unexplained inter-annual variation. Thus, overall, the impacts of fire
   were relatively minor and short term at the community level.
   4. Different functional groups of ants (as defined by Andersen, 1997)
   responded to fire in strikingly different ways. Generalised Myrmicinae
   (e.g. Pheidole spp., Monomorium viride ) were affected more severely by
   fire than were the other functional groups. In contrast, the dominant
   Dolichoderinae (Forelius pruinosus ) exhibited a large increase after
   the fire and seemed to be responsible for the decline in abundance of
   several species.
   5. A strong negative correlation between F. pruinosus and other groups
   of ants immediately after the fire suggested more intense competition
   among ants at that time. Six months post-fire, the abundance of F.
   pruinosus decreased markedly and the abundance of other species
   rebounded.
   6. The rapid post-fire recovery of the ant community probably reflects
   adaptations of ants to a chronic fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{Information on amphibian responses to fire and fuel reduction practices
   is critically needed due to potential declines of species and the
   prevalence of new, more intensive fire management practices in North
   American forests. The goals of this review are to summarize the known
   and potential effects of fire and fuels management on amphibians and
   their aquatic habitats, and to identify information gaps to help direct
   future scientific research. Amphibians as a group are taxonomically and
   ecologically diverse; in turn, responses to fire and associated habitat
   alteration are expected to vary widely among species and among
   geographic regions. Available data suggest that amphibian responses to
   fire are spatially and temporally variable and incompletely understood.
   Much of the limited research has addressed short-term (1-3 years)
   effects of prescribed fire on terrestrial life stages of amphibians in
   the southeastern United States. Information on the long-term negative
   effects of fire on amphibians and the importance of fire for maintaining
   amphibian communities is sparse for the majority of taxa in North
   America. Given the size and severity of recent wildland fires and the
   national effort to reduce fuels on federal lands, future studies are
   needed to examine the effects of these landscape disturbances on
   amphibians. We encourage studies to address population-level responses
   of amphibians to fire by examining how different life stages are
   affected by changes in aquatic, riparian, and upland habitats. Research
   designs need to be credible and provide information that is relevant for
   fire managers and those responsible for assessing the potential effects
   of various fuel reduction alternatives on rare, sensitive, and

   patterns on forested lands. TELSA, a spatially explicit vegetation
   succession model with the ability to apply user-defined management
   actions and stochastic wildfires calibrated to local conditions, was
   used to evaluate changes in several indicators of habitat condition. We
   assessed seral stage and patch size changes over multiple 200-year
   simulations under a constant rate of harvest within each of these
   analyses. In the absence of natural disturbances, old growth habitat and
   large patches of forest of similar age and tree species composition
   decreased unless special management practices were applied. Old-growth
   management area reserves and periodic `aggregated cutblock' harvesting
   entries helped maintain forest seral stage distribution at the target
   level, and patch size characteristics similar to the patterns that would
   have occurred under historic natural disturbances. Adding wildfire to
   the management scenarios substantially reduced the amount of old-growth
   habitat in designated old-growth management area reserves, compromising
   the ability to maintain old-growth at target levels. A 50\% increase in
   the area designated as old-growth management area reserves would be
   required to offset the loss of old growth due to wildfire. Although the
   amount of old-growth habitat was diminished by wildfire, the
   availability of large habitat patches greater than 250 ha increased. We
   discuss the need to consider the role of management and natural
   disturbances in landscape planning, and suggest that redundancy is
   essential to maintain those features vulnerable to stochastic
   disturbances. Landscape scenario modeling can facilitate the development
   of risk averse plans, and encourage the development of innovative
   approaches to achieving timber and non-timber objectives. (C) 2000

Title = {{Silviculture and fire effects on understorey flowering in jarrah forest}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY}},
Abstract = {{Long-term forest monitoring undertaken by Forestchecksince 2001 has
   examined the effects of silvicultural treatment on floral diversity and
   assemblage composition in the jarrah forest of southwest Western
   Australia. Both prescribed burns and wildfires have overlain the network
   of Forestcheckmonitoring sites, providing the opportunity to examine
   fire and silviculture interactions in natural experiments and allowing
   experimental control of time-since-fire effects on the flora. We report
   here two opportunistic experiments. First, the early effects of
   prescribed burns in spring on the flowering of the vascular flora were
   compared with closely paired sites that were long unburnt. Second, the
   early effects of a wildfire in summer on the flowering of the vascular
   flora were compared between silvicultural treatments. Flowering richness
   tended to be less on burnt grids in the non-peak period in the first two
   years after fire in one experiment, but there were no differential
   effects of silviculture on flowering assemblages arising from
   interaction with wildfires. Flowering assemblages varied from year to
   year and the extent to which they varied differed between locations but
   not as a result of silvicultural treatments. We conclude that no special
   management with respect to plant flowering is required to remedy
   outcomes of interaction between wildfire and silvicultural treatments.
   Further information is needed to understand the long-term implications
   of variability in flowering assemblages and how it affects the
   reproductive viability of understorey species and their interactions
   with pollinator networks in the face of a changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{The Cyprus mouflon is an endangered species inhabiting Cyprus' Paphos

   subspecies in a single reserve which is threatened by habitat
   degradation, forest fires and diseases transmitted by domestic sheep

   climate of Cyprus has become warmer and drier. Water has been pumped
   from Paphos forest for irrigation purposes, draining many artesian
   springs which were providing water for the mouflon. Lack of water in
   combination with lack of forage inside the forest is driving the mouflon
   outside the forest and bringing them into contact with domestic sheep
   and goats, which might be infected with scrapie and pulmonary
   adenomatosis. So far, no mouflon were found to be infected with these
   diseases, but transmission is possible. In July 1998, a fire originating

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{139-149}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Semi-natural habitats have been shaped by human disturbance regimes
   for centuries. Spatially and temporally heterogeneous land-use
   practices, such as cutting, burning, grazing and turf-cutting, have
   resulted in complex mosaic landscapes that are of high priority for
   conservation in Europe. Contemporary conservation subjects these systems
   to management regimes that are generally less diverse, in terms of
   disturbances and fine-scale temporal and spatial variability, than
   traditional land use, but the ecological consequences of these
   simplifications are unclear.
   2. We investigated the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant
   species composition and diversity along local environmental (moisture)
   gradients in coastal heathlands. A replicated series of post-fire
   successions (n = 12) was initiated in three heathland habitats and the
   areas subjected to two grazing regimes. Floristic and environmental data
   were recorded in permanent plots over a 5-year period. Community data
   were analysed using multivariate ordination techniques (principal
   components analysis, partial redundancy analyses, and principal response
   curves) and generalized linear models.
   3. Fire induced strong successional trends in the species composition of
   the heathlands. These trends differed among heathland habitats, and with
   grazing. Strong interactions between fire, habitat and grazing implied
   that the effect of grazing on the successional dynamics differed among
   habitats. Species diversity decreased in the first year after fire but
   increased beyond the pre-fire levels during succession. This trend was
   not affected by local environment or grazing, although there were main
   effect differences in diversity between environments and grazing
   regimes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that the two
   management practices do not have simple additive effects within the
   semi-natural system studied, as grazing created ecological opportunities
   for additional sets of species, increased variability among habitats,
   and added complexity to the post-fire successional dynamics. In order to
   preserve diversity, conservation management should thus aim to preserve
   the level of complexity of the traditional management regimes, both in
   terms of the actual disturbances (e.g. fire and grazing) as well as the
   spatial scales at which they are applied. Further, the considerable
   change in these effects along the local environmental gradient brings
   into question the efficiency of general management prescriptions, and
   indicates that local environmental variability should be taken into
   account in the conservation of semi-natural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic plant species invasion can alter ecosystem nutrient dynamics and
   natural disturbance patterns. The Australian tree Melaleuca
   quinquenervia has extensively invaded the Florida Everglades and is
   currently being suppressed using mechanical, herbicidal, and biological
   control management strategies. While these methods have been evaluated
   based on reductions in density and abundance of the target weed, other
   factors should be considered including consequences for ecosystem
   nutrient storages and interactions with natural disturbances such as
   fire. We hypothesized that the choice of management tactics, namely
   herbicidal or biological control, would differentially influence the
   quantity and availability of soil nutrients before and after a seasonal
   fire. The management of M. quinquenervia with a herbicide reduced the
   above-and belowground storage of nutrients both before and after a fire
   compared to a non-invaded area, while biological control increased
   storage. There were no differences in nitrogen availability between
   sites (non-invaded, herbicide, biological control) in the 0-5 cm or 5-15
   cm soil depths before or after the fire. Pre-fire phosphorus
   availability was highest in the non-invaded site in the 05 cm soil depth
   and in the biological control site in the 5-15 cm soil depth. However,
   phosphorus availability was highest at both depths in the herbicide site
   post-fire. Biological control of M. quinquenervia using insect
   herbivores has proven to be effective at controlling plant growth and
   reproduction. The results of this study suggest that this method may
   have less of an impact on nutrient storage and cycling than herbicides.

Abstract = {{The dry prairie grasslands of central Florida once dominated the
   landscape from Lake Kissimmee to Lake Okeechobee, encompassing 1.1
   million hectares. These prairies have been largely reduced to four
   protected sites, where the federally endangered Florida Grasshopper
   Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) and Bachman's Sparrow
   (Aimophila aestivalis) are year-round residents. Management of dry
   prairie habitat has usually involved late-fall and winter prescribed
   burns to maintain habitat in an early successional state, which is
   preferred by these sparrows. Naturally ignited fires on dry prairie
   ecosystems, however, occur most frequently in summer. Because this
   grassland evolved with summer wildfires, we sought to understand how
   prescribed summer burns affected the two rare emberizid sparrows that
   breed and winter there. Between 1994 and 1996 we studied the effects of
   pr escribed summer fires on Florida Grasshopper and Backman's sparrows
   at the Kissimmee Prairie Sanctuary and Three Lakes Wildlife Management
   Area. Grasshopper Sparrows were more sensitive to timing of prescribed
   fires than were Bachman's Sparrows. Both species increased in density
   following mid-June fires, but only Bachman's Sparrows responded
   positively to July fires. We found that both species occupied burned
   areas one week after burning and remained reproductively active into
   September.}},

Title = {{Managing grassland for wildlife: the effects of rotational burning on
   tick presence and abundance in African savannah habitat}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Ticks are obligate blood-feeding ectoparasites that have negative
   effects on animals through blood loss and vectoring disease. Controlling
   ticks is a major aspect of wildlife management in many areas, including
   African savannah where ticks are a long-standing problem. Rotational
   burning of vegetation is widely thought to reduce ticks but empirical
   data are lacking. We investigate the effect of block rotational burning
   on tick populations in a South African wildlife reserve. We measured
   tick presence/abundance using tick drags in multiple blocks of five
   different burn ages (areas burned 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years previously). We
   also assessed herbivore diversity using dung as a proxy. Tick presence
   was highest in areas burned 2-3 years previously. It was lowest in
   recently-burned areas (probably due to fire-induced mortality or loss of
   field-layer refugia) and areas burned >= 4 years previously (probably
   because the lack of palatable grass meant herbivore abundance was lower;
   this is supported by significantly lower herbivore presence in old burns
   and significant positive correlation between tick numbers and herbivore
   presence). Burn age and, to a lesser extent, block, were significantly
   related to tick presence and abundance at both larval and nymph stages.
   The model that best explained tick numbers, though, included the
   interaction between burn age and block due to substantial inter-block
   variability in mid-burn blocks relative to lower variability in blocks
   at the start or end of the burn cycle. This suggests that burn age and
   block-specific conditions together influence tick abundance, with
   habitat heterogeneity likely being an important modifier of the effect
   burning has on tick numbers. Although annual burning of large areas

Title = {{Tallgrass prairie management and bird nest success along roadsides}},

Abstract = {{The attributes of roadside vegetation, an important bird habitat in
   grassland ecosystems, have been shown to affect bird abundance,
   distribution composition, and diversity, yet there are relatively few
   works on reproductive success of birds nesting along roadsides. Because
   roadsides are linear habitats, management at the landscape scale can
   affect nest success in roadsides through bottom-up and top-down effects.
   In northeastern Oklahoma tallgrass prairie is subjected annually to
   prescribed spring fires. In the short term fires can alter both
   arthropod abundance and predator access to nests. We explored effects of
   burning on bird nest success with a five-year study along roads that
   traversed tallgrass prairie habitat. Using data from similar to1400
   nests of 23 species, we generated nest survival curves for groups of
   altricial species defined by nest substrate (ground, shrub, tree, or
   culvert). We then determined if these curves were affected by management
   practice (spring burning), food abundance (arthropod biomass), and
   habitat attributes (tree density and height). Nest substrate had a large
   effect on nest success: despite their shorter nest exposure period,
   ground nests were least successful and culvert nests were most
   successful. An increase in arthropod biomass following burning was
   possibly the cause for the increased nest success in burned plots,
   regardless of substrate, suggesting bottom-up control.. Tree height and
   nest height were correlated positively with nest success, whereas tree
   density had no effect. Conversely, nest predation rates were correlated
   negatively with nest success, with ground nests experiencing the highest
   predation, culvert nests the lowest. Our results suggest that burning
   may increase nest success through bottom-up processes, but some species
   may not benefit from the increase in food abundance as a result of a
   concomitant increase in predation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wildfires can completely obliterate above-ground vegetation, yet some
   small terrestrial mammals survive during and after fires. As knowledge
   about the physiological and behavioural adaptations that are crucial for
   post-wildfire survival is scant, we investigated the thermal biology of
   a small insectivorous marsupial (Antechinus flavipes) after a severe
   forest fire. Some populations of antechinus survived the fire in situ
   probably by hiding deep in rocky crevices, the only fire-proof sites
   near where they were trapped. We hypothesised that survival in the
   post-fire landscape was achieved by decreasing daytime activity and
   using torpor frequently to save energy. Indeed, daytime activity was
   less common and torpor expression was substantially higher (>= 2-fold)
   at the post-fire site than observed in an unburnt control site and also
   in comparison to a laboratory study, both when food was provided ad
   libitum and withheld. Basking in the post-fire site was also recorded,
   which was likely used to further reduce energy expenditure. Our data
   suggest that torpor and basking are used by this terrestrial mammal to
   reduce energy and foraging requirements, which is important in a
   landscape where food and shelter are limited and predation pressure
   typically is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Stand-level spatial pattern influences key aspects of resilience and
   ecosystem function such as disturbance behavior, regeneration, snow
   retention, and habitat quality in frequent-fire pine and mixed-conifer
   forests. Reference sites, from both pre-settlement era reconstructions
   and contemporary forests with active fire regimes, indicate that
   frequent-fire forests are complex mosaics of individual trees, tree
   clumps, and openings. There is a broad scientific consensus that
   restoration treatments should seek to restore this mosaic pattern in
   order to restore resilience and maintain ecosystem function. Yet,
   methods to explicitly incorporate spatial reference information into
   restoration treatments are not widely used. In addition, targets from
   reference conditions must be critically evaluated in light of climate
   change. We used a spatial clump identification algorithm to quantify
   reference patterns based on a specified inter-tree distance that defines
   when trees form clumps. We used climatic water balance parameters,
   down-scaled climate projections, and plant associations to assess our
   historical reference sites in the context of projected future climate
   and identify climate analog reference conditions. Spatial reference
   information was incorporated into a novel approach to prescription
   development, tree marking, and monitoring based on viewing stand
   structure and pattern in terms of individuals, clumps, and openings
   (ICO) in a mixed-conifer forest restoration case study. We compared the
   results from the ICO approach with simulations of traditional basal area
   and spacing-based thinning prescriptions in terms of agreement with
   reference conditions and functional aspects of resilience. The ICO
   method resulted in a distribution of tree clumps and openings within the
   range of reference patterns, while the basal area and spacing approaches
   resulted in uniform patterns inconsistent with known reference
   conditions. Susceptibility to insect mortality was lower in basal area
   and spacing prescriptions, but openings and corresponding opportunities
   for regeneration and in situ climate adaptation were fewer.
   Operationally, the method struck a balance between providing clear
   targets for spatial pattern directly linked to reference conditions,
   sufficient flexibility to achieve other restoration objectives, and
   implementation efficiency. The need to track pattern targets during
   implementation and provide immediate feedback to marking crews was a key
   lesson. The ICO method, especially when used in combination with climate
   analog reference targets, offers a practical approach to restoring
   spatial patterns that are likely to enhance resilience and climate
   adaptation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relatively low productivity of the herbaceous stratum of the

   evaluate alternative means of increasing large herbivore production. A
   mathematical programming model was developed to evaluate alternative
   vegetation management programs for large herbivore production in the

   the combination of livestock enterprises, lease-hunting enterprises, and
   vegetation management practices that maximized discounted net returns
   over a 15-year period. Results indicated that by integrating both
   herbicides and prescribed fire into vegetation management programs,
   sufficient herbivory can be sustained to support an economically viable
   level of livestock production. Vegetation management programs derived
   under multiple-enterprise objectives differ significantly from those in
   conjunction with a single enterprise. Economic returns from cattle
   production are maximized by applying herbicides that induce large
   increases in grass production, and thus, allow for significant expansion
   of the cattle enterprise. Under multiple-enterprise objectives, 2
   herbicides and prescribed burning may be integrated effectively to
   sustain sufficient production of grasses, forbs, and browse to support
   expanded cattle, Angora goat, and white-tailed deer populations.
   Economic returns from the land resource can be increased approximately
   46\% as a result of employing multiple-enterprise management objectives.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{73-86}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The post-fire soil faunal communities are formed both by animals having
   survived the fire and by colonizers from the surrounding landscape. The
   relative impact of these processes is largely affected by fire
   intensity. However, with the same fire intensity, the severity of the
   fire and, thus, the survival of soil animals could vary depending on
   environmental heterogeneity. We hypothesized that much fewer soil
   animals would survive the same fire intensity on shallow, dry soils than
   on deep, moist soils. To clarify the impact of soil depth and moisture
   on animal survival after fire, we conducted a burning experiment in the
   laboratory. Soil samples containing indigenous populations of soil fauna
   were taken along two transects from the top, slope and foot of two
   respective rocky outcrops within a mixed coniferous forest in Central
   Sweden. Half of the samples were burnt and half were left unburnt.
   Burning depth varied between 24 mm (soils from the top of the gradient)
   to 12 mm (slope and foot soils) indicating a difference in flammability.
   The proportion of animals surviving fire seemed to be fairly independent
   of burning depth (42 to 62\% survival rate). Contribution of eggs which
   survived fire in the soil to the overall animal abundance restoration
   was negligible (1-3\%).
   A multi-trophic approach resulted in different sensitivity estimates to
   artificial burning of various parameters. Abundance and biomass of all
   fauna groups studied was more sensitive to fire than species richness.
   Collembolans and macrofauna predators were the groups most tolerant to
   fire, while oribatid mites and macrofaunal detritivores showed higher
   mortality after the fire treatment. Despite a more pronounced alteration
   of the components of soil food-web by burning in the lowland Sphagnum
   plots, they may be important as refugia, especially for more slowly
   moving soil-dwelling macro- and microarthropods. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Over the last decade, substantial numbers of Eucalyptus viminalis across
   the Monaro plains in south-eastern NSW have been observed as declining
   in health. Based on a systematic road survey, the affected area is
   estimated to cover around 2000km(2), with almost all E. viminalis within
   that area either dead or severely affected. Other eucalypt species
   present show minor levels of health deterioration. Field observations
   include widespread infestation of an endemic but previously undescribed
   species of eucalyptus weevil (Gonipterus sp.). Eight sites were chosen
   to represent the range of management practices and recent fire history
   in the affected area. The structural complexity, tree health and level
   of weevil infestation were determined at each site, and despite large
   differences in structural elements and overall complexity, the severity
   of dieback was consistently severe across the range. There does not
   appear to be sufficient evidence to conclude that changed land
   management practices, recent fire history or declining levels of
   structural complexity are responsible for this Monaro dieback'. If the
   dieback continues at the current rate, it seems inevitable that E.
   viminalis will disappear entirely from the Monaro region. As E.
   viminalis is the dominant species in most of the region, such
   disappearance will have very serious consequences on the ecology of the
   region. Further work is required to determine if the dieback is related
   to changes in climate or rainfall patterns. Trials of potential
   replacement E. viminalis genotypes and alternative eucalypt species
   should be undertaken as a precaution in case the dieback cannot be
   reversed.}},

Abstract = {{North American grassland environments are endangered as a result of
   degradation and conversion for agriculture and housing. Efforts to
   manage and restore grasslands have traditionally focused on monitoring
   plant communities to determine restoration success, but the
   incorporation of animal communities may provide important benchmarks of
   ecosystem function and restoration. Ants play many roles in maintaining
   ecosystem health in temperate grasslands, but relatively little is known
   about how ant communities respond to restoration. We studied the role
   that restoration age and prescribed burns have on ant communities in two
   types of Illinois grasslands, prairies and savannas, and identify
   indicator species of restoration success. Grassland environments
   included remnants and restorations that varied in age from newly
   restored sites, to sites that have been under restoration for > 15 yr.
   We demonstrate that prairie and savanna ant communities are distinct,
   but respond to restoration in a similar manner. Three distinct prairie
   ant assemblages were identified based on the age of restoration of a
   site-sites < 3 yr old, sites that have been under restoration > 5 yr,
   and remnant prairies. Four distinct savanna ant assemblages were
   identified based on the age of restoration of a site-sites < 3 yr old,
   sites 5-15 yr old, sites > 15 yr old, and remnant savanna environments.
   After accounting for restoration age, time since last burn in both
   prairie and savannas does not explain community composition or species
   richness. Several ant species in both prairies and savannas have
   predictable changes in incidence that indicate their suitability for use
   as indicator species.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major
   and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population
   viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban
   encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without
   accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a
   medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot
   (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia.
   We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and
   parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The
   models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road
   encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is
   known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat
   fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly
   vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local
   extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated
   metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with
   large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population
   abundance than small-scale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local
   extirpation of I. obesulus and other small-to medium-sized
   ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we
   recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex
   corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road
   underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the
   probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however,
   adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned
   fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be
   required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in
   rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-active conservation approach is
   required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that
   prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-term
   probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This
   strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and
   currently relatively common species from becoming rare.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decades, Portugal like several other Mediterranean countries
   has been affected by frequent wildfires. This has led to various field
   tests of post-fire soil conservation measures and, in particular,
   mulching with forest slash residues. While forest residue mulching was
   shown to be highly effective in reducing post-fire erosion, its side
   effects on soil fauna communities have not been studied and are also
   difficult to predict from the - scarce - literature on mulch effects in
   general. Therefore, this study compared the abundance, diversity and
   taxonomic and functional composition of the ground-dwelling arthropod
   communities of three mulched and, as control, three untreated erosion
   plots of roughly 100m(2) that had been installed in a eucalypt
   plantation almost immediately after a wildfire in 2010, some five years
   earlier. This was done using three pitfall traps per plot, placed at the
   lower, middle and upper part of the study slope. Roughly five years
   after mulching, its impacts on the ground-dwelling arthropod were rather
   limited, especially compared to its effect on overall soil erosion
   rates. One of the few exceptions was the abundance of the Hymenoptera -
   one of the most frequently occurring orders - which was significantly
   lower in the mulched than control plots. This and other near significant
   mulching impacts found in this study plainly justify a follow-up study
   on short-term effects. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The wild population of the palm Ptychosperma macarthurii near Darwin, in
   monsoonal northern Australia, is regionally endangered and provides a
   focus to illustrate a range of issues pertinent to conservation of
   rainforest habitat. Surveys in 1990 found that several populations
   exhibited a polarised size class structure typified by large adults and
   small juvenile plants. over the following decade, in the absence of
   wildfire and in a period of reduced disturbance from introduced buffalo
   (Bubalus bubalis), cattle (Bos indicus) and pig (Sus scrofa), sufficient
   small juvenile plants survived and grew so as to infill the intermediate
   size classes. Three stage (bifid, juvenile and adult) transition matrix
   models characterised the population as declining under all observed
   conditions (intrinsic rate of increase: unburnt + few animals 0.9850;
   unbumt + many animals 0.9584; burnt < 1 year 0.8737; burnt 1-2 years
   0.9146; burnt > 2 years 0.9937). In the absence of fire, simulations
   conducted to explore management options revealed a positive rate of
   increase with exclusion of introduced animals. With only partial
   introduced animal control or supplementation with juvenile plants, the
   median rate of increase remained negative. The regional population is at
   risk by more frequent and more intense fire due to the invasion of
   exotic grass species and land use changes in the catchment which result
   in an increased drying of the rainforest habitat. Ongoing decline is the
   most likely outcome in the absence of effective management intervention.

Abstract = {{Salamanders are an important ecological component of eastern hardwood
   forests and may be affected by natural or silvicultural disturbances
   that alter habitat structure and associated microclimate. From May to
   August in 2008 (pretreatment) and 2011 (post-treatment), we evaluated
   the response of salamanders to three silvicultural practices designed to
   promote oak regeneration - prescribed fire, midstory herbicide
   application and shelterwood harvest - and a control. We trapped
   salamanders using drift fences with pitfall traps in five replicates of
   the four treatments. Only the southern gray-cheeked salamander Plethodon
   metcalfi and the southern Appalachian salamander P. teyahalee were
   captured in sufficient numbers for robust statistical analysis. We
   analyzed data for these species using single-species dynamic occupancy
   models in statistical software program R. We allowed changes in four
   covariates to influence extinction probability from pre- to
   post-treatment implementation: 1) percent leaf litter cover; 2) percent
   understory cover; 3) percent CWD cover; and 4) percent canopy cover. The
   final combined model set describing extinction probability contained
   four models with Delta AIC < 2 for P. metcalfi and nine models with
   Delta AIC < 2, including the null model, for P. teyahalee. For both
   species, the 95\% confidence intervals for model-averaged extinction
   probability parameter estimates overlapped zero, suggesting none were
   significant predictors of extinction probability. Absence of short-term
   salamander response in midstory herbicide and prescribed burn treatments
   was likely because of minor or transitory changes to forest structure.
   In shelterwood harvests, any potential effects of reduced canopy and
   leaf litter cover may have been mitigated by rapid post-treatment
   vegetation sprouting. Additionally, climatic conditions associated with
   high elevation sites and high amounts of rainfall in 2011 may have
   compensated for potential changes to microclimate. Continued monitoring
   of Plethodon salamanders to assess responses at longer time scales (e.g.
   > 3 years post-treatment) is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has a profound, though paradoxical influence on landscapes of the
   southeastern U.S.; it simultaneously maintains native biodiversity and
   ecosystem processes but also threatens silvicultural resources and human
   landscapes. Furthermore, since the majority of the southern landscape is
   heavily influenced by human activities, contemporary fire regimes are
   human managed disturbances within extant fire-dependent ecosystems.
   Though there is considerable uncertainty in climate projections for the
   southeastern U.S., climate change will likely impact both prescribed
   fire and wildfire. In this review, we synthesize climate change-fire
   interactions, discuss the impacts of uncertainty in a human-dominated
   landscape, and illuminate how both climate change projections and their
   uncertainties might impact our ability to manage forests in the
   Southeast. We define the Southeast region as consisting of the Gulf
   Coastal Plain, Lower Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont and southern
   Appalachians and associated subregions. This region has the greatest
   area burned by prescribed fire, the highest number of wildfires in the
   continental U.S. and contains globally significant hotspots of
   biodiversity, much of which is dependent on frequent fire. The use of
   prescribed fire as a management tool depends on a suite of weather and
   fuel conditions which are affected by climate. Over the next five
   decades, general circulation models (GCMs) consistently predict air
   temperature to increase by 1.5-3 degrees C in the Southeast.
   Precipitation forecasts are more uncertain with respect to the mean;
   but, most models predict an increase in precipitation variability.
   Increases in the likelihood of severe droughts may increase wildfire
   occurrence while simultaneously limiting the implementation of
   prescribed burning by restricting the number of days within current
   prescription guidelines. While the Southeast has among the highest
   potential for C storage and sequestration, a reduction in C
   sequestration capacity due to increasing disturbances such as drought,
   insect infestations, hurricanes and fire, is possible. The potential for
   long-term shifts in forest composition from climate-altered fire regimes
   if coupled with an increased potential for wildfire occurrence could
   reduce quality and quantity of water released from forests at times when
   demand for high quality water will intensify for human use. Furthermore,
   any reduction in prescribed burning is likely to result in decreased
   biological diversity, particularly in the Coastal Plain, a global
   hotspot of biodiversity. Lastly, more future area burned by wildfire
   rather than prescribed fire has the potential to negatively influence
   regional air quality. Mitigating the negative effects of climate
   change-fire interactions would require actively exploiting favorable
   seasonal and inter-annual climate windows. Monitoring the type
   conversions of agricultural and fiber production forest will be critical
   for long-term projections of fire risk and watershed impacts of altered
   fire regimes. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Hirola (Beatragus hunteri) is one of the most critically endangered
   antelope whose population is in decline, and its extinction might be the
   first loss of a mammalian genus in Africa since evolution of modern man.
   This decline has been attributed to, but is not limited to, habitat
   loss. Despite hirola introduction to Tsavo East National Park, its
   population has been stagnating at about 100 since 1996, and the reasons
   for this are not well documented. This research was aimed at determining
   the species' distribution in relation to environmental variables. Data
   on the presence of hirola were collected between 2008 and 2011 through
   long-term monitoring of hirola using aerial census and ground tracking.
   From this, a model was developed to predict the species' habitat
   preferences. The model predicted that hirola preferred areas close to
   supplemented water, roads, seasonal rivers and water logged areas but
   avoided areas close to wooded grassland, tsetse infested and rapidly
   drained areas. This research concludes that hirola distribution depends
   on availability of fresh grass shoots, shade plants and tsetse-free
   areas. To increase hirola carrying capacity in Tsavo East National Park,
   it calls for habitat manipulation through irrigation of rapidly drained
   areas, provision of supplemented water, prescribed burning and
   introduction of tsetse control strategies.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{We manipulated the fire regime and soil disturbance in four
   grass-dominated Carolina bay wetlands during a prolonged drought period
   and examined vegetation composition and cover within dominant vegetation
   types prior to and after treatments. We used the seedling emergence
   technique to determine the role of the seed bank in the recovery
   process.
   Burning did not affect richness, evenness, or diversity (all vegetation
   types combined); however, soil tillage increased diversity, including
   both evenness and richness. Percent similarity of the vegetation before
   and after disturbance was greater in the burning treatment than in the
   tillage treatment, probably due to greater disruption of the rhizomes of
   the perennial vegetation by tillage. Vegetation types varied in degree
   of recovery, although dominance was not altered by either treatment.
   Several native fugitive species increased following disturbance,
   indicating that species coexistence in these Carolina bay wetlands
   depends on the life history characteristics of residual vegetation, as
   well as that of seed bank species.
   The seed bank (72 600 seedlings/m(2)) was larger and species richness
   (108 species) was greater than reported for most other freshwater
   wetlands. No differences in species richness, evenness, or diversity
   were detectable among the seed banks associated with different
   vegetation types in the bays. The floristic composition of the seed bank
   did not resemble the standing vegetation in patches dominated by large
   perennial grasses (Panicum hemitomon, Leersia hexandra, and Andropogon
   virginicus). In contrast, seed bank samples associated with vegetation
   dominated by an annual forb (Iva microcephala) or the small perennial
   grasses Panicum wrightianum or P. acuminatum var. unciphyllum more
   closely reflected the standing vegetation.
   Species appear to persist with recurring and multiple disturbances
   because of seed banks, rhizomes, morphological plasticity during
   inundation, sexual reproduction following inundation, and perenniality
   coupled with early sexual maturity. Conservation management of
   intermittently inundated wetlands should incorporate techniques to
   foster maintenance of endemic species richness and the recruitment of
   rare species. During periods of drought, it may be desirable to disturb
   the aggressive perennial vegetation to allow recruitment of less common
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Management of rangelands has changed substantially over the past few
   decades; today there is greater emphasis on wildlife management and
   increased interest ill using natural disturbances such as fire to manage
   rangeland plant and animal communities. To determine the effect of
   prescribed fires on the distribution of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus), we used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to monitor
   the movements of bucks and does during four, month-long, trials before
   and during the year after implementation of three late summer burns.
   Deer were expected to increase their use of burned areas to take
   advantage of fresh plant growth after the disturbance. However, the only
   increased use of burns occurred 1-2 months after treatment. The presence
   of cattle did not limit deer use of burns. Low use of burned areas was
   attributed to drought conditions, which limited vegetation regrowth.
   Other than a brief flush of fresh grass in autumn, no changes in plant
   cover could be ascribed to the burns. Thus, in semi-arid areas, use of
   prescribed burns to reduce brush cover and increase forb production for
   deer may not be successful, at least in the short-term, if lack of
   rainfall limits regrowth of vegetation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

   non-native plant invasions were moderate or major problems at their

   problems, listing nearly 200 problem species. Over 12\% indicated weeds
   were their worst problem. Weed control programs are now in place in
   wildlands across the continent, employing techniques ranging from manual
   removal, mechanical methods, prescribed fire, judicious use of
   herbicides, the release of biological control agents, and encouragement
   of native competitors. The most successful endeavors follow an adaptive

   prioritized, and control measures are selected and implemented where
   appropriate. Emphasis is placed on preventing new weeds from becoming
   established and on early detection and elimination of incipient

   in place of the weeds and periodically re-evaluate whether their

Abstract = {{Bark beetle-caused tree mortality in conifer forests affects the
   quantity and quality of forest fuels and has long been assumed to
   increase fire hazard and potential fire behavior. In reality, bark
   beetles and their effects on fuel accumulation and subsequent fire
   hazard have only recently been described. We have extensively sampled
   fuels in three conifer forest types (lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce
   and Douglas-fir) and described bark beetle/fuels/fire interactions
   within the context of intermountain disturbance regimes. Our data sets
   were developed by measuring the forest biomass in stands with endemic,
   epidemic and post-epidemic bark beetle populations and comparing the
   quantity and quality of fuels present within each beetle population
   phase. Surface and canopy fuels data were used to create fuel models
   that are customized to represent the actual fuel conditions created by
   the bark beetles. Fire behavior predictions based on these custom fuel
   models showed that surface fire rate of spread and fireline intensities
   were higher in the current epidemic stands than in the endemic stands
   due to increased litter and fine fuel in all three forest types. Bark
   beetles selectively remove large diameter trees altering stand level
   canopy fuels and promoting release of herbaceous and shrub species which
   further affects fire potential. Bark beetle-caused tree mortality
   decreases vegetative sheltering which affects mid-flame wind speed and
   increases rate of fire spread. Passive crown fires are more likely in
   post-epidemic stands, but active crown fires are less likely due to
   decreased aerial fuel continuity. Intense surface fires are possible in
   post epidemic stands, but they are very much dependent on the rate at
   which dead trees fall.
   Our present research will utilize this information in addition to
   spatial data to describe the influence of mountain pine beetle (MPB) on
   fuels and fire behavior in stands of high-elevation five-needle pines,
   including whitebark, limber, foxtail, Rocky Mountain bristlecone, and

Abstract = {{Closed-canopy forests dominate the landscape across much of the eastern

   availability and nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) for elk (Cervus

   forage availability, NCC using a 12\% and 14\% crude protein nutritional

   stands, reclaimed surface mines, and 6 timber harvest treatments (timber
   harvest only, with early growing-season fire, with late growing-season
   fire, with herbicide only, with herbicide and early growing-season fire,
   and with herbicide and late growing-season fire). Forage availability in
   treatments involving timber harvest was greater than in untreated mature
   forest stands and reclaimed surface mines. Forage availability estimates
   in treatments involving herbicide and prescribed fire were less than all
   other timber harvest treatments. Nutritional carrying capacity estimates
   at the 12\% and 14\% crude protein constraints were greater in timber

   species coverage was less on reclaimed surface mines and in timber
   harvest treatments involving herbicide and prescribed fire than in all
   other timber harvest treatments and untreated mature forest stands.
   Greater coverage of herbaceous forage species in treatments involving
   herbicide and prescribed fire and on reclaimed surface mines compensated
   for reduced forage availability and resulted in NCC estimates similar to
   all other timber harvest treatments. Our data indicate using periodic
   prescribed fire and following an herbicide application with prescribed

   Using telemetry data, we investigated nonruminant zebra (Equus

   camaa), use of burnt patches in a landscape mosaic of nutrient-poor, old
   grassland interspersed with young, recently burnt, nutrient-rich grass
   patches. The Mkambati Nature Reserve landscape on the east coast of
   South Africa provided large grazers with a challenge in finding and
   using appropriate patches in which to forage to meet their nutritional
   requirements. In Mkambati, grassland fires, mostly ignited by poachers,
   induce regrowth of young nutrient-rich grass, which subsequently attract
   grazers. We tested if the study animals foraged more in burnt patches
   than in the unburned grassland and whether burnt patch use was related
   to the distance to the previously visited burnt patch, burnt patch size,
   burnt patch age, and distance to areas with high poaching risk using
   MANOVA. In general, zebra moved faster than red hartebeest, and both
   species moved faster in unburnt grassland than in burnt patches. Red
   hartebeest and zebra patch selection were influenced by interpatch
   distance, patch age, patch size, and poaching risk. A limited set of
   intrinsic traits, i.e., body mass, digestion strategy, and muzzle width,
   yielded different patch use rules for the two species. Large ungulates
   patch use behaviour varied among species and across conditions and was
   influenced by anthropogenic impacts such as poaching and changed fire

   functional traits between rare and common species may be indicative of
   the functional causes of species rarity and may therefore be useful in
   crafting species conservation strategies. However, there is a
   conspicuous lack of studies comparing the functional traits of rare
   species and co-occurring common species. We measured 18 important

   distributions to determine whether there are significant functional
   differences that may explain species rarity. Flowering, fire, and

   suppression has driven rarity in this system and that changes to the

Abstract = {{We investigated threats to the California condor (Gymnogyps
   californians), a flagship endangered species, using individual data on
   survival during a 20 year period of intensive recovery efforts. Over the
   two decades of reintroductions, condors in California had an estimated
   median survival time of 7.8 years suggesting that 50\% of condors are
   expected to survive in the wild long enough to contribute to recruitment
   In general, annual mortality rates exceeded levels necessary for a
   stable population; however, mortality declined, reaching levels needed
   for population stability, during the second decade of re-establishment.
   Intensive management practices, including utility pole aversion training
   and clinical interventions to prevent lead-related deaths likely
   contributed to the decrease in mortality rates. Utility line collision
   and/or electrocution was an important factor causing mortality over the
   two decades; though, this threat has largely been mitigated through
   management and targeted efforts in high-risk areas. In the past,
   wildfires were not considered a major threat to survival of free-flying
   condors. However, our analyses suggest that forest fires are
   significantly linked to the hazard of death, and increased wildfire
   activity in California highlights this population's vulnerability to
   catastrophic losses from forest fire. Lead poisoning, which was a major
   driver in the population's decline, was a leading cause of death
   accounting for the greatest adult mortality, and lead exposure remains
   the most significant threat. Recent lead ammunition reduction efforts in
   the condor range in California hold promise for improving the recovery
   potential for this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Conservation managers regularly burn vegetation to regenerate habitat
   for fire-dependent species. When determining the time since fire at
   which to burn, managers model change in a species' occurrence over time,
   post-fire (fire-response curve) and identify the time since fire
   associated with decline in occurrence. However, where species exhibit
   variability in their fire response across space, using a single
   fire-response curve to determine the timing of burns may lead to burning
   habitat at an inappropriate time since fire. We tested if elevation,
   local topography, soil properties, vegetation type or evapotranspiration
   affect the fire response of the endangered Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus
   mallee and its hummock-grass habitat Triodia scariosa in southeastern
   Australia (n = 217). Previous work on the Mallee Emu-wren found a
   unimodal fire response with decline in occurrence at similar to 30-50 yr
   since fire and a time window of occurrence of similar to 30 yr. We found
   that time since fire and elevation interact to affect the Mallee
   Emu-wren fire response. At high elevations (55-98 m), Mallee Emu-wrens
   declined in occurrence at similar to 50 yr since fire, with a time
   window of occurrence of 20-40 yr. However, at low elevations (28-55 m),
   Mallee Emu-wrens showed no decline in occurrence with increasing time
   since fire with a time window of occurrence of up to 107 yr. Extent
   cover of Tall T. scariosa showed similar patterns to the Mallee
   Emu-wren, indicating that vegetation structure is a likely driver of
   variability in the Mallee Emu-wren fire response. We speculate that the
   effect of low elevation is mediated by increased soil nutrient and water
   availability for key plants. We used our findings to map the appropriate
   time since fire at which to burn to regenerate habitat for the Mallee
   Emu-wren across the study region. We recommend no burning for
   regeneration across one-third of potential habitat, because the Mallee
   Emu-wren showed no decline in occurrence in these areas. We recommend
   managers model variability in species' fire responses across space to
   improve the timing of burns for regeneration.}},

   South African grassland bird and arthropod assemblage structure and

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds
   and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and
   grazing in South Africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and
   stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (October-March).
   Bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways,
   driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat
   structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. Similarly,
   arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to
   management practices. Fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure
   and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at
   all taxonomic levels. In particular, fire frequency strongly influenced
   grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the
   territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. Insectivores, and
   nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial
   management. Of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted
   pipit (Anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally Vulnerable
   because of habitat loss. This species is sensitive to any form of
   habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in
   these grasslands. Of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area,
   only Orthoptera responded positively to burning. However, orthopterans
   made up on average 78\% of arthropod biomass in moist highland
   grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt
   farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores.
   This reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure
   of performance, such as reproductive Success, is considered in assessing
   ecosystem condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, fire is used as a management tool to mitigate wildfire
   risk and conserve biodiversity. Use of time since disturbance as a
   surrogate for faunal occurrence presents an appealing basis for
   biodiversity conservation; however, successional change in resource
   availability is often the direct driver of change in animal occurrence
   rather than time per se, and rates of resource development can be highly
   variable. To facilitate prediction of animal responses to disturbance,
   we sought to test whether time since fire (TSF) and habitat structure
   can predict bird occurrence. Time is only expected to predict occurrence
   if (i) species respond to structural resources and (ii) the abundance of
   these resources can be predicted by time. We examined the responses of
   15 bird species to habitat structure and TSF using a 70-year
   chronosequence spanning three forest types in southeast Australia.
   Habitat structure variables predicted the occurrence of 13 species, four
   of which also responded to TSF. The levels of associations between
   occurrence, structure and TSF varied among vegetation types but response
   shapes were generally consistent. The fact that the majority of species
   did not respond to TSF indicates that TSF is an inappropriate surrogate
   for avian occurrence in our study system. Further, it is unlikely to be
   a reliable surrogate for faunal occurrence in forests that exhibit
   variable rates of post-fire structural development. We suggest that
   relationships between TSF and structure can provide insight into the
   capacity of TSF to predict animal occurrence. They will also reveal the
   extent to which fire can be used as a tool for managing biodiversity,
   and species likely to benefit or be at risk from particular fire
   regimes. This is critical given projected increases in the frequency and
   extent of fire in many regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Responses of woody plant communities on native rangelands in the western

   dormant-season burns, 5 rangeland sites that received a combination of 1
   dormant-season and 1 growing-season burn, and 5 sites of nontreated

   Dimmit and La Salle Counties, Tex. Woody plant cover was estimated using
   the line intercept method, and stem density was estimated in 25-x 1.5-m
   plots. Species richness did not differ among treatments. Percent woody
   plant cover was reduced by 50 and 41\% on winter and winter-summer
   combination burned sites, respectively. Honey mesquite (Prosopis
   glandulosa Torr.), twisted acacia (Acacia schaffneri S. Wats.), Texas
   persimmon (Diospyros texana Scheele), lotebush {[}Ziziphus obtusifolia
   (Hook.) T.\&G.], wolfberry (Lycium berlandieri Dunal), and tasajillo

   Salm-Reif.-Dyck) declined on winter burned sites. Inclusion of summer
   fire into the burning regime did not increase declines in woody plants.
   Fire created a post-fire environment which resulted in the decline of
   many woody plant species. It is unclear to what degree other
   environmental factors such as herbivory and competition between woody
   plants and among woody and herbaceous vegetation may have interacted
   with fire in producing woody plant declines. Fire may be a useful tool

Abstract = {{Natural wildfire regimes are important for ecosystem succession but can
   have negative ecological effects depending on fire characteristics. A
   portion of a granite rock barrens landscape that extends along the
   eastern shoreline of Georgian Bay, Lake Huron to eastern Ontario,
   Canada, burned in 2018 during a wildfire that affected >11,000 ha. This
   landscape is a biodiversity hotspot providing habitat for many species
   at risk where freshwater turtles nest in soil deposits in cracks and
   crevices in the bedrock dominated by moss (Polytrichumspp.) and lichen
   (Cladoniaspp.) cover. To assess the initial effect of wildfire on
   freshwater turtle nesting habitat, we measured soil depths and estimated
   moss, lichen, and vascular plant cover at 2 morphology types (crevice,
   flat) in burned and unburned areas of the landscape. The probability
   that burned flat plots supported soil was near zero; the burned flat
   plots had 98\% less soil volume compared to unburned flat plots.
   Although crevices were more resistant to soil loss, burned crevices
   still had a 15\% lower probability of having soil and 35\% less soil
   volume compared to unburned crevice plots. We estimated nest site
   availability by calculating the number of locations with shallow (5-10
   cm), intermediate (10-20 cm), and deep (>20 cm) soils required for a
   small (5 cm x 5 cm) or medium (10 cm x 10 cm) nest chamber. Overall, the
   burned open rock barrens had 71-73\% fewer sites with suitable soil
   depth and volume for a nest chamber of either size. Furthermore, burned
   plots had almost no lichen and moss cover but were dominated by bare
   soil, forbs, and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) seedlings. Although the
   loss of tree cover in previously forested areas may increase nest site
   availability for freshwater turtles in newly open areas, we suggest that
   organic soil combustion and soil erosion may require restoration
   activities in the post-fire landscape to support successful nesting of
   at-risk turtles. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Early succession plant communities consisting of a diverse mixture of
   grasses, forbs, and scattered shrubs are required by a variety of
   wildlife species. Early seral stages follow some form of disturbance but
   can become dominated by shrubs and trees rather quickly, especially in
   areas with abundant rainfall and relatively long growing seasons, such
   as the southeastern United States. In the absence of natural disturbance
   regimes, the quality and maintenance of these plant communities for
   wildlife is largely dependent upon management. Prescribed fire, disking,
   herbicide applications, and mowing are practices commonly used to
   maintain early succession plant communities for various wildlife species
   throughout this region. Prescribed fire consumes vegetative debris,
   provides open structure at ground level, and facilitates travel and
   foraging for wildlife throughout the field. Burning during the dormant
   season may promote cool-season grasses if they are present in the field.
   Burning in late March or early April generally promotes warm-season
   grasses and forbs. Late growing-season fire (September) will reduce
   woody encroachment and may encourage additional forb cover. Disking
   promotes vegetation decomposition, provides open structure at ground
   level, and generally promotes annual plant species. Disking in the fall
   and winter stimulates more forb growth than disking in the spring, which
   will stimulate undesirable normative warm-season grasses if present in
   the seedbank. Selective herbicides can influence plant composition and
   can be used to encourage grasses where forbs dominate, to promote forbs
   where grasses dominate, and to reduce woody cover. Mowing during
   midsummer encourages additional grasses in fields dominated by forbs but
   is not recommended for field maintenance because mowing produces thatch,
   which limits the ability of several wildlife species to travel and
   forage through the field, suppresses the seedbank, and destroys nests
   and young wildlife. Several practices can be used in combination to meet
   specific objectives. Succession should be set back every 2 to 4 yr,
   depending on plant response and focal wildlife species. It is important
   to intersperse disturbance in space and time, so that a variety of cover
   types are always available, even to those animals with small home
   ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Managers of commercial forests are increasingly expected to incorporate
   conservation of biodiversity in forest management plans, but a paucity
   of information exists regarding herpetofaunal responses to mid-rotation
   release practices of dormant-season prescribed fire and selective
   herbicide in intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) stands. However,
   these management tools have demonstrated capabilities of improving
   conservation value in these forests in the southeastern United States.
   Therefore, we investigated summer herpetofaunal responses to factorial
   combinations of dormant-season prescribed fire and a commonly used
   herbicide (imazapyr) with a randomized complete block design of 6
   mid-rotation pine stands with 4 experimental units in Mississippi, USA,
   to which we applied at random 1 of 4 treatments (i.e., burn only,
   herbicide only, burn + herbicide, control). We captured 814 reptiles and
   3,699 amphibians of 17 and 16 species, respectively, using drift-fence
   arrays during May and June, 1999-2007. Herpetofaunal assemblages only
   differed between burn + herbicide and control plots in 2002.
   Species-specific responses were limited to differences across years
   within treatments and greater eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus
   undulatus) relative abundance in burned or herbicide-treated sites soon
   after treatment. Furthermore, herpetofaunal associations with measured
   environmental variables (e.g., vegetation structure and biomass and
   trap-site characteristics) did not indicate that treatment influenced
   fluctuations in species relative abundances. Consistent with past
   studies, forest managers of commercial pine forests using dormant-season
   prescribed fire with or without imazapyr will most likely have minimal
   additional effects on herpetofaunal assemblages, but current knowledge
   gaps require additional research to better understand mechanisms of

Abstract = {{Emulating natural disturbance has become a paradigm for biodiversity
   retention in forest management. This study evaluates the extent to which
   harvest management practices have created stands that emulate natural
   fire disturbance from the perspective of bird communities in Ontario,
   Canada. We compared the relative abundance of forest landbirds at the
   stand level in mature forest (> 80 years old) with that in
   early-regenerating (0-20 years) and midregenerating (21-80 years)
   forests originating from fire or timber harvest across the boreal forest
   of Ontario using over 7000 point counts. Our results indicate that
   forest harvest management practices in Ontario have created stands that
   only partially emulate natural fire disturbances in terms of the bird
   community composition. Total bird abundance and species richness were
   significantly lower postharvest than postfire in midregenerating
   forests, although they did not differ in early-regenerating stands.
   Species-level comparisons revealed several differences between
   postharvest and postfire stands, as well as among age classes. Although
   no species was completely missing from any stand type, 8\% of species in
   early-and 34\% in midregenerating stands were detected significantly
   less often in postharvest than postfire forests. Some other species were
   found significantly more often in postharvest stands, while the majority
   of species detected (84\% and 71\% in early-and midregenerating stands,
   respectively) showed no significant difference between disturbance
   types. Collectively, these results suggest that widespread replacement
   of fire with logging as the dominant disturbance type will shift the
   relative abundance of species within Ontario's boreal forest bird
   community. Quantifying the population-level implications of these shifts
   requires extrapolating these stand level effects to the landscape level,
   while considering the actual or anticipated abundance and distribution
   of forest age classes across the province under different forest
   management regimes.}},

   factors. To determine how breeding mourning doves (Zenaida macroura)
   respond to these changes, we examined nest site use and nest survival in
   control plots, fuel reduction plots before and after mechanical
   thinning, and post-wildfire sites. The greatest number of nests (50\%)
   were located in post-wildfire sites where resprouted vegetation and
   woody debris provided numerous nest sites in the understory. We found
   fewer nests in post-treatment fuel reduction plots (17\%), where most
   were constructed in cottonwoods, and an intermediate number of nests in
   control and pre-treatment plots (33\%), where most were constructed in
   exotic plants. The best-supported logistic-exposure nest survival model
   indicated that survival varied among years and with date. Models
   containing effects of forest type, study block, and nest site selection
   received little support, suggesting that survival was constant among
   plot locations, disturbance types, and nest sites. Our nest survival
   estimates were low relative to those from other studies, but
   productivity could offset mortality if adults make numerous nest
   attempts each year. Our results highlight the utility of woody
   vegetation and debris as understory nest sites for mourning doves and
   other riparian birds. Managers should devise methods to preserve or
   reestablish these nest sites when conducting fuel reduction, exotic
   vegetation removal, or post-fire restoration activities. (C) 2011 The

Abstract = {{Frequent fires were used as a management tool to maintain prairies,
   savannas, and woodlands in the southern Great Plains of the United
   States. However, fire exclusion beginning in the mid-1900s allowed for
   the establishment and growth of fire-intolerant species such as eastern
   redcedar (Juniperus virginiana: ERC) beyond their naturally occurring
   habitats. Apart from the reduction in burning, wide soil and climate
   adaptability, and seed dispersal by birds have facilitated the expansion
   of ERC in the southern Great Plains. The encroachment of ERC has caused
   heavy ecological and economic losses to Oklahoma and thus has been a
   major management concern for the past few decades. This study utilized
   count data modeling to analyze USDA Forest Service's (USFS) Forest
   Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to investigate the relationship
   between available ecological and economic factors and the abundance of
   ERC in grassland and forested ecosystems of Oklahoma. The results
   suggested that low site productivity, high basal area, dense canopy, and
   silt loam soil texture significantly increase the abundance of ERC on a
   given site. The results also indicated that the rate of ERC encroachment
   is 3.3\% higher in the softwood and 2.0\% higher in the miscellaneous
   forests, compared to the hardwood forests. However, the economic
   variables of the study such as ownership type, adoption of active
   management, and proximity to a metropolitan area did not show a
   significant relationship to the abundance of ERC.}},

Abstract = {{Species-rich semi-natural grasslands in Europe are a main target for

   years. Out of the 88 species analyzed, five were more frequent in burnt
   plots compared with mowed plots (Vicia cracca, Cirsium arvense, Urtica

   although vegetation composition becomes more trivial with annual spring
   burns, there might be long-term benefits for nectar-feeding insects.}},

Abstract = {{We determine the time frame after initial fuel treatment when prescribed
   fire will be likely to produce high enough mortality rates in ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Dougl. ex Laws.) regeneration to
   be successful in maintaining treatment effectiveness in the Black Hills
   of South Dakota. We measured pine regeneration in disturbed stands and
   young pine growth rates to estimate the susceptibility of pine
   regeneration to prescribed fire with time since initial treatment. We
   also determined surface fuel accumulation rates for stands after
   prescribed fire to help estimate likely fire behavior in maintenance
   prescribed fire. Given our estimates of regeneration density and tree
   size, and likely fire behavior, we then used small pine tree
   mortality-fire effect relations to estimate the effects of prescribed
   fire on developing understory, pine at specific times since initial
   treatments.
   Fuel treatments in ponderosa pine forests will lose their effectiveness
   within 10-20 years if regeneration densities are not controlled. The
   ability to successfully use prescribed fire to maintain low regeneration
   densities is dependent on seedling/sapling size and the frequency of
   burns. Current prescribed fire prescriptions and fuel loads are adequate
   to maintain low densities of ponderosa pine seedlings (<1 m tall) if
   burns occur every 10 years. If burn intervals exceed 15 years,
   regeneration can attain sizes that reduce susceptibility to prescribed
   fire under typical operational weather conditions. After 20-25 years,
   ponderosa pine can reach sizes that will require flame lengths that
   exceed 2 m to obtain significant mortality. Achieving these flame
   lengths will require burning under drier weather conditions to allow
   coarse woody debris (CWD) consumption to contribute to the fire
   intensity. Alternatively, managers can augment sites with activity fuels
   to increase fine fuel loadings to achieve flame lengths that will
   increase sapling susceptibility to fire, while burning when CWD fuel
   moistures are high to limit the potential for extreme fire behavior.
   While the flames might kill sapling-sized trees, mature overstory trees
   could still maintain resiliency to fire. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{107-116}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires are one of the most important drivers of forest composition
   and biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin. Many studies have
   demonstrated that fires can affect insect diversity by altering the
   functional traits of species groups. We examined the 5-year response of
   beetles to wildfires by assessing patterns of community composition
   across a gradient from forest interior to forest edge to burnt forest
   area in Southern Italy. Our objective was to characterize the
   relationship between distance from the forest edge and occurrence of
   beetle taxonomic assemblages. We analyzed the composition, similarity,
   and dominance of ground beetle communities in randomly selected plots
   located along the forest-to-burned-area gradient. We found a negative
   relationship between community similarity and distance from the forest
   edge; moreover, the composition of species assemblages (within each
   family) became increasingly similar with proximity to the forest edge.
   As the distance from the forest edge into the burned area became greater
   the dominance of few species increased, and species composition shifted
   toward habitat generalists. The results partially support the notion
   that the differences in beetle communities probably are driven by
   habitat changes caused by fires, especially for those taxa with many
   specialist species in feeding and oviposition habitats. Understanding
   the biological effects of wildfires is necessary prior to design
   management strategies and policies for counteracting the loss of

Abstract = {{Recurrence of recent large wildfires is threatening the permanence of
   Pinus nigra Arnold (Black pine) forests in central Catalonia (NE Spain),
   due to the almost nil post-fire regeneration of this non-serotinous
   pine. Potential practices to carry out extensive reforestation programs
   with P. nigra may differ widely in terms of their final success,
   economic cost and undesired ecological impact. In this framework, we
   have analysed different types of vegetation clearing (mechanical,
   controlled burning or grazing), soil preparation (ripping or planting
   holes) and reforestation methods (broadcast seeding, spot seeding and
   planting) to restore P. nigra forests. We have compared these practices
   in terms of seedling establishment, but also in the light of their
   economic costs and ecological impact, through a new multi-criteria
   analysis. Seedling establishment after sowing was very poor and not
   influenced by vegetation clearing. In plantations, seedling survival was
   higher in the ripper treatment than in planting holes for all vegetation
   clearing treatments except the control one. Nevertheless, the higher
   economic cost of the planting holes treatment and the negative impact of
   mechanical clearing and burning on the small mammals community made the
   stated differences in seedling survival irrelevant. Thus, the
   multi-criteria analysis revealed that the two most preferred options
   were planting in uncleared or lightly grazed areas with soil preparation
   through ripping. This study gives some valuable insights about the use

Volume = {{393}},
Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{The exclusion of anthropogenic fire is a primary factor responsible for
   the `mesophication' of eastern oak (Quercus) forests and resultant oak
   regeneration problems. Consequently, the reintroduction of fire is
   increasingly used to promote the establishment and growth of oak and
   hickory (Carya) and control competition from shade-tolerant species
   (e.g., red maple (Acer rubrum)) in the forest understory. In this study,
   we examined the effects of fire frequency on the abundance of prominent
   species in the woody regeneration layer in oak-dominated forests of
   eastern Kentucky. Treatments included: (1) fire-excluded (FE); (2)
   frequent fire (FF) - five burns over nine years, and (3) less-frequent
   fire (LFF) - two burns over seven years. Prior to burning (2002) and
   again five and seven growing seasons following the cessation of burning
   in the FF and LFF treatments (2015), respectively, we inventoried tree
   species in the woody regeneration layer into three size classes: (1)
   small seedlings (stems < 0.6 m), (2) large seedlings (>= 0.6 m and <1.2
   m) and (3) small saplings (>= 1.2 m and <3.8 cm diameter at breast
   height). Pre - and postburn, the regeneration layer was dominated by
   non-Oak-Hickory species, and although Oak-Hickory regeneration was
   abundant the majority of stems were <0.6 m. For Oak-Hickory, significant
   treatment effects were limited to the large seedling and small sapling
   size classes. For large Oak-Hickory seedlings, density was significantly
   greater in the LFF than FE treatment. For small Oak-Hickory saplings,
   density in the LFF treatment was similar to 17 and similar to 4 times
   greater than in the FE and FF treatments, respectively. This study
   provides support for the notion that fire-free periods may be more of a
   factor controlling the abundance and composition of the woody
   regeneration layer than simply the number of burns. However, despite
   greater stem density, the fate of the Oak-Hickory regeneration layer
   that developed in response to the LFF treatment is uncertain, as the
   density of non-oak competitors remains high. Additional treatments
   (e.g., targeted herbicide application, additional burning) may be
   necessary to reduce the abundance of non-oak species and increase the
   likelihood of continued recruitment Oak-Hickory should natural or
   silvicultural release events occur. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were
   historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In
   recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and
   frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important
   breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of
   this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is
   largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer
   wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio
   Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian
   nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over
   a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes
   located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by
   wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (< 7 yr after fire) had a much different
   vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (> 7 yr after fire)
   wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did
   recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens)
   and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and
   wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model
   selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that
   frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with
   wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well.
   Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned
   sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding
   rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and
   unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots,
   while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation
   varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was
   not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that
   predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness,
   and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense
   vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's
   wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to
   vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire
   management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would
   enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in
   riparian zones.}},

Abstract = {{Fire, flooding, herbivory, and the effects of climate are all topical
   issues for today's land managers. Effective resource management requires
   a balance among these processes, which in turn, requires a better
   understanding of their interactions. Beaver (Castor canadensis) are
   strong colonizers and have been successfully reintroduced to much of
   their former range. Prescribed fire has also been introduced in many
   areas as a management tool to restore ecological function. Resource
   managers have often assumed fire would also benefit non-target species
   like beaver; however, its effect on beaver has not been well studied. In
   this study, part of a broader project in Elk Island National Park,
   Canada, we examine the effect of prescribed fire on beaver lodge
   occupancy in the context of high ungulate populations. Elk Island
   National Park has an active beaver population, high ungulate densities,
   and a well-established prescribed fire program. We examine whether
   frequency, size, and timing of burns influence beaver lodge occupancy
   and the establishment of new lodges. Since 1979, over 51\% of the park
   (99.3 km(2)) has been burned with prescribed fire. By comparing lodge
   occupancy over a period prior to and after a series of prescribed burns,
   we analyzed beaver occupancy rates pre- and post-burn. Our results show
   that repeated burning dramatically decreases beaver lodge occupancy, and
   that even after one burn the number of active colonies declines and does
   not recover to pre-fire populations. Especially when combined with
   drought and herbivory, prescribed fire does not improve beaver habitat.

Abstract = {{Land managers face the difficult challenge of maintaining biodiversity
   on lands also used for commodity production. We present an approach for
   managing the habitats of terrestrial vertebrates at the landscape scale
   on multiple-use lands. The approach is based on the hypothesis that
   animal community response to landscape change is a function of species
   life histories and local patterns of landscape change. Key steps are:
   (1) set clear objectives; (2) associate target species with specific
   habitat configurations; (3) assess the potential sensitivity of species
   by mapping habitat suitability and examining species life histories; (4)
   evaluate alternative management prescriptions using simulation models;
   and (5) implement preferred or experimental strategies and monitor the
   responses of habitats and species.
   The approach was demonstrated for a watershed in western Oregon.
   Management objectives were to maximize habitat diversity for early- and
   late-successional bird species and to produce saw timber at levels
   compatible with the habitat goals. Habitat associations of 51 bird
   species were described by four variables that encompass three spatial
   scales. An analysis of species sensitivity to landscape change revealed
   several species that may merit special attention. The landscape model
   LSPA and the gap model ZELIG.PNW were used to simulate four
   disturbance/management scenarios over a 140-yr period: natural fire,
   wood production, multiple use, and no action. The results indicated that
   65\% more saw timber would be produced under the wood production run
   than the multiple-use run, but the former would maintain habitats for
   many fewer bird species than the latter. The multiple-use scenario was
   selected as the preferred alternative. We suggest carrying out
   management experiments and rigorous monitoring during the implementation
   phase.
   While this approach has various limitations, it is an incremental step
   towards the effective management of species diversity on multiple-use
   lands.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud forests are one of the most diverse and yet one of the most
   endangered ecosystems in the tropics. Epiphytic bryophytes are extremely
   diverse and abundant in this ecosystem where the palms are a dominant
   element. Slash and burn agriculture techniques usually do not cut the
   palms and they remain as isolated individuals in the middle of
   artificial grasslands or agricultural fields. Forest clearing creates
   new environments on the isolated trees that have been considered a
   refugee for ``rare{''} canopy species, and the relationship of these
   ``isolated{''} communities with forest communities has been considered
   to be distant. We sampled 99 plots on 11 individuals of the palm
   Dictyocaryum lamarckianum for a total effective sampling area of 15.9
   m(2). The epiphytic communities comprised 72 liverworts and 21 mosses.
   Diplasiolejeunea alata and D. cavifolia are hereby reported for the
   first time from Colombia. We analyzed the changes in bryophyte diversity
   patterns between forests and man-made grasslands and how these patterns
   are related to the distribution of locally rare species. Our results
   showed a decrease in the number of species from the bottom to the top of
   the palm and from the forest to the grassland. Rare species were mostly
   concentrated in the forest independently of height. Common species moved
   on average 4 m downward on the palms in the grassland relative to the
   height on the forest. Ordination of the plots using NMDS provided
   evidence that the change in species composition is gradual between
   forests and grasslands and from the base of the palms to the canopy. We
   propose that the new communities generated by slash and burning
   practices are a combination of drought tolerant species from the forest
   and species that are commonly found in disturbed sites. In conclusion,
   isolated palms are not islands where canopy species can be preserved as
   they harbor only common species.}},

   a post-fire landscape, to compare results from chaparral-dominated
   upland vegetation with results from interspersed patches of riparian
   vegetation, and to identify characteristics of individual chaparral
   stands that might make some stands more valuable to bumble bees than
   others. We captured 2,494 bumble bees of 12 species, and used Bayesian
   hierarchical modeling to determine that bumble bee abundance was
   substantially greater in riparian plots (modeled capture rate (x) over
   bar = 1.10 +/- 0.31 {[}SD] bees/survey in 2015, and 2.96 +/- 0.83
   bees/survey in 2016) than in upland plots ((x) over bar = 0.47 +/- 0.07
   bees/survey in 2015, and 1.27 +/- 0.18 bees/survey in 2016), which
   comprised a mix of chaparral shrubs and associated herbaceous plants.
   Modeled species richness was also greater in riparian plots, with an
   average mean richness of 4.1 +/- 1.8 bumble bee species in riparian
   plots versus 2.3 +/- 1.3 species in upland plots across the 2 years of
   the study. Within upland and riparian areas, plots dominated by
   herbaceous vegetation had greater abundance and species richness. One
   chaparral shrub species, bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), was foraged
   on preferentially over all other shrub species and over all but 1 forb
   taxon, and was associated with increased occupancy probability in the
   Vosnesensky bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii), the most abundant bumble
   bee species on our study plots. A complex of closely related herbaceous
   species in the genus Phacelia, commonly associated with upland chaparral
   in our study area, was the plant taxon most frequently used by bumble
   bees, and appeared to be particularly important during midsummer after
   bearclover flowers became scarce. Our findings suggest that post-fire
   chaparral communities are generally less intensively used by bumble bees
   than nearby riparian vegetation but may nevertheless provide important
   habitat. When chaparral removal is part of post-fire forest regeneration
   strategies, bumble bees will likely benefit from retention of a mosaic
   of upland habitat patches dominated by herbaceous vegetation and, in our
   study area, bearclover, which may provide foraging resources throughout
   the life cycle of local bumble bee colonies. Because habitat
   characteristics affected the occupancy of individual bumble bee species
   differently, managers should consider foraging preferences of target
   bumble bee species when making land management decisions. (C) 2017 The

Title = {{Role of multiple invasion mechanisms and their interaction in regulating
   the population dynamics of an exotic tree}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{885-894}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Understanding the mechanisms that allow exotic species to have rapid
   population growth is an important step in the process of controlling
   existing invasions and preventing future invasions. Several hypotheses
   have been proposed to explain why some exotic species become invasive,
   the most prominent of which focus on the roles of habitat disturbance,
   competitors and consumers. The magnitude and direction of each of these
   mechanisms on population dynamics observed in previous studies is quite
   variable. It is possible that some of this variation results from
   interactions between mechanisms.
   2. We examined all of these mechanisms and their interactions on the
   population dynamics of the Asian exotic tree Ailanthus altissima
   (Simaroubaceae) in fire-suppressed oak-hickory forests in Missouri, USA.
   We experimentally reduced herbivory (using insecticide), reduced
   interspecific competition (plant removals), and manipulated disturbance
   with prescribed fire. We projected the effects of these treatments and
   their interactions on population dynamics by parameterizing an integral
   projection model.
   3. The lowest population growth rate is found where fire is absent and
   biotic interactions are present. Fire increased population growth rate,
   likely through the suppression of interspecific competitors, since
   competitor removal treatments increased population growth rate in the
   absence but not presence of fire.
   4. These results indicate that biotic resistance from interspecific
   competitors, more so than consumers, is important for slowing the
   invasion of A. altissima. Furthermore, disturbances that weaken biotic
   interactions, such as fire, should be used with caution when restoring
   habitats invaded by A. altissima.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Examining the main and interactive
   effects of disturbance, competition and herbivory on the population
   dynamics of exotic species provides a comprehensive understanding of the
   role of these factors in the invasion process and provides guidance for
   exotic species management.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{177-185}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a key natural and anthropogenic disturbance factor across many
   ecosystems, and also an important conservation management tool. However,
   little is known about arthropod responses to fire, particularly in
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems, including the biodiverse Cape Floristic
   Region (CFR). We investigate here the relative variety of responses by
   different arthropod taxa to fire, and ask whether single-taxon or
   multi-taxa approaches better suit post-fire biomonitoring for
   conservation management. Sampling involved multiple techniques and was
   conducted before fire, 1 year after fire, and 3 years after fire, with
   unburned areas as controls. Before-and-after statistics were used to
   identify changes in arthropod populations and assemblages as a result of
   fire, and between treatment and control sites. However, this was against
   a background of the annual effects having a major influence on the
   arthropods, irrespective of fire. Abundance was so variable, even in
   control plots, that we found it an unreliable indicator of the impact of
   fire. Overall, arthropods were remarkably resilient to fire, with most
   taxa recovering in species richness and assemblage composition within 3
   years of the fire. Although all taxa showed resilience to fire, there
   was nevertheless little congruence in temporal recovery of the various
   taxa. Our results highlight the shortcomings of monitoring fire impacts
   using only a single-taxon without prior testing for complementarity or
   sensitivity to fire, while emphasizing the importance of sampling a wide
   range of taxa to represent overall responses of compositional
   biodiversity. From this, we recommend, at least for the CFR, that a
   cross-section of taxa, such as butterflies, ants, and scarab beetles, be
   used for monitoring arthropods in recovery/fire management conservation
   programmes. We also recommend that such monitoring be considered against
   the background of large annual variation seen in unburned areas.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in plant abundance within a eucalypt savanna of north-eastern
   Australia were studied using a manipulative fire experiment. Three fire
   regimes were compared between 1997 and 2001: (i) control, savanna burnt
   in the mid-dry season (July) 1997 only; (ii) early burnt, savanna burnt
   in the mid-dry season 1997 and early dry season (May) 1999; and (iii)
   late burnt, savanna burnt in the mid-dry season 1997 and late dry season
   (October) 1999. Five annual surveys of permanent plots detected
   stability in the abundance of most species, irrespective of fire regime.
   However, a significant increase in the abundance of several subshrubs,
   ephemeral and twining perennial forbs, and grasses occurred in the first
   year after fire, particularly after late dry season fires. The abundance
   of these species declined toward prefire levels in the second year after
   fire. The dominant grass Heteropogon triticeus significantly declined in
   abundance with fire intervals of 4 years. The density of trees (>2 m
   tall) significantly increased in the absence of fire for 4 years,
   because of the growth of saplings; and the basal area of the dominant
   tree Corymbia clarksoniana significantly increased over the 5-year
   study, irrespective of fire regime. Conservation management of these
   savannas will need to balance the role of regular fires in maintaining
   the diversity of herbaceous species with the requirement of fire
   intervals of at least 4-years for allowing the growth of saplings >2 m
   in height. Whereas late dry season fires may cause some tree mortality,
   the use of occasional late fires may help maintain sustainable
   populations of many grasses and forbs.}},

Abstract = {{Sciurus niger niger (Southern Fox Squirrel, hereafter, SFS) are habitat

   Spring Island, SC, once reported the densest population of SFSs in the
   southeast, but residents of the island community recently reported
   decreasing SFS populations and increasing EGS populations. We used
   baited game-cameras at stratified random points to estimate SFS density,
   observe patterns of SFS and EGS diurnal activity, and examine the
   influence of habitat structure and management techniques (e.g.,
   prescribed fire) on SFS and EGS occurrence on Spring Island. Our
   estimate of SFS density on Spring Island (0.28-0.97 SFSs/ha) was similar
   to the high density previously reported (0.758 SFSs/ha). SFSs and EGSs
   had similar diurnal patterns, but SFSs were most active around midday
   while EGSs were most active in early morning and evening hours. EGS
   occupancy was negatively associated with fire frequency. EGS detection
   probability was negatively associated with maximum daily temperature.
   These data suggest that habitat management via prescribed fire has
   allowed stable populations of both SFSs and EGSs to persist despite

Abstract = {{Over a century of fire suppression activities have altered the structure
   and composition of mixed conifer forests throughout the western United
   States. In the absence of fire, fuels have accumulated in these forests
   causing concerns over the potential for catastrophic wildfires. Fuel
   reduction treatments are being used on federal and state lands to reduce
   the threat of wildfire by mechanically removing biomass. Although these
   treatments result in a reduction in fire hazard, their impact on
   wildlife is less clear. We use a multi-species occupancy modeling
   approach to build habitat-suitability models for 46 upland forest birds
   found in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra Nevada based on forest
   structure and abiotic variables. Using a Bayesian hierarchical
   framework, we predict species-specific and community-level responses to
   changes in forest structure and make inferences about responses of
   important avian foraging guilds. Disparities within and among foraging
   group responses to canopy cover, tree size and shrub cover emphasized
   the complexities in managing forests to meet biodiversity goals. Based
   on our species-specific model results, we predicted changes in species
   richness and community similarity under forest prescriptions
   representing three management practices: no active management, a typical
   fuel reduction treatment that emphasizes spacing between trees, and a
   thinning prescription that creates structural heterogeneity. Simulated
   changes to structural components of the forest analogous to management
   practices to reduce fuel loads clearly affected foraging groups
   differentially despite variability in responses within guilds. Although
   species richness was predicted to decrease slightly under both simulated
   fuels reduction treatments, the prescription that incorporated
   structural heterogeneity retained marginally higher species richness.

Abstract = {{Many studies have investigated the ecological effects of roads and

   individual species' abundance along roadsides and in adjacent interior
   habitat (> 150 m) before and after prescribed fire at three ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson \& C. Lawson) sites in northern
   Arizona. Eighteen of the 20 exotic plant species found in this study

   exotic species richness than adjacent forest interior habitats, but only
   one site showed a significant (decreasing) fire effect on species
   richness. Four exotic plant species had significantly higher densities

Abstract = {{After a century of fire suppression, conifer forests in the western
   United States have dramatically departed from conditions that existed
   prior to Euro-American settlement, with heavy fuel loads and an
   increased incidence of wildfire. To reduce this threat and improve
   overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale
   treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to
   disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the
   remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these
   treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We
   used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal
   (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective
   harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on
   wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that
   small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects
   on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met
   our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for
   wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments,
   (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design
   using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New
   Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer
   (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis
   occurred <20 years post-treatment on sites <400 ha. Small-diameter
   harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and
   selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small
   mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory
   removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We
   examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds
   and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging
   birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal
   and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and
   wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently
   being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the
   wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term (: 10
   years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement
   across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density.
   We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments,
   but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species
   at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative
   response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of
   data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation managers of oak woodlands have been reintroducing fire both
   as an ecological process per se and to assist in restoring native plant
   communities. To increase our understanding of the impacts of
   reintroduced fire on ground-dwelling invertebrates we examined the
   response of ants and spiders to a late season (autumn) prescribed fire
   conducted in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland ecosystem in
   northern California. Twelve 100 m x 100 m plots were established, six
   plots received a burn treatment and the remaining six plots were
   unburned controls. Ants and spiders were sampled using pitfall traps
   left open continuously and collected approximately every 32 days.
   Sampling was conducted over a year, consisting of four pre-burn and nine
   post-burn collections. Abundance was analyzed using a repeated measures
   ANOVA, which showed seed-harvester ants decreased significantly in the
   two months following the fire. Total spider abundance also showed a
   significant decrease in two months, although this did not occur
   immediately after the burn. One spider hunting guild, the `diurnal
   ambush' group (Thomisidae) remained suppressed for up to nine months.
   Correspondence analysis measures of ant species abundance with
   environmental and vegetation variables (percent rock, bare ground, plant
   species richness and height of herbaceous vegetation) were higher than
   expected by chance, which assists in explaining some of the responses.
   Findings from this study revealed that the reintroduction of autumn
   burns has modest and short-term effect on the invertebrates sampled,

Abstract = {{Tropical dry forests and savannas are important repositories of plant
   diversity and ecosystem services in the tropics. These ecosystems are
   also used extensively for grazing by livestock, and represent a critical
   element of the rural economy of many tropical countries. Fire is
   considered as a part of co-evolution in these ecosystems across the
   globe. However, in recent decades, there has been a shift in historical
   fire regime. Fire has become more frequent in these landscapes, and
   could be further enhanced under climate change. This poses threats to
   existing biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and rural economy. We asked
   how variability in fire frequency has influenced diversity and
   heterogeneity in grass species composition, and richness and abundance
   of grass species preferred by large herbivores (referred to as grazing
   acceptability) in a South Indian tropical savanna forest. We assumed
   that an increase in fire frequency acts as the active constraint and
   limits an ecosystem from attaining the maximum heterogeneity, and the
   maximum grazing acceptability (maximum richness and abundance of grass
   species preferred by herbivores) in its native settings. We used MODIS
   active fire and burned area products to estimate fire frequency across
   the landscape. A nested sampling approach was used to collect
   information on vegetation and soil at different fire frequencies.
   Quantile regression analyses indicated that diversity and heterogeneity
   in grass species composition as well a's grazing acceptability decreased
   with increasing fire frequencies. We found that livestock grazing
   intervened with the observed vegetation patterns; grass species
   diversity and heterogeneity, and grazing acceptability increased with
   grazing intensity at lower quantiles. Other measured covariates,
   rainfall, and soil-fertility, alone were not able to explain the
   observed vegetation patterns in the landscape. The results show a need
   to control annual fires but allow and manage intermittent fires in this
   landscape. A complete suppression of fire is not desirable as fire
   releases nutrients from burning of deeper-rooted vegetation and thus
   acts as a periodic nutrient pump. It also played an important role in
   maintaining the grass cover by reducing shrub cover. Hence, it is
   important to consider the complex interactions between
   fires-grazers-soil-vegetation to develop effective management practices.
   We conclude that fire frequency should be managed at low to intermediate
   levels (one fire in every 5-9 years, resembling the native settings),
   and grazing regulated, in order to sustain wild and domestic herbivores,
   biodiversity, and other key ecosystem processes and services over the
   long-term. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In Scots pine Pinus sylvestris forests, the important ecological effects
   of natural fires could be emulated using prescribed fire. Species that
   may benefit from fire effects include capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, a
   large forest grouse. A key component of forest habitats for capercaillie
   is the ericaceous shrub, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, which is eaten by
   capercaillie, and supports abundant arthropods, taken by young chicks.
   We carried out an experiment testing whether prescribed burning would be
   a valuable technique for capercaillie habitat management. The study took
   place at Abernethy Forest, the largest ancient native pinewood in
   Britain, and a key capercaillie site, holding c 8-20\% of the British
   population. Prescribed fire in woodland is highly novel in Britain. We
   therefore also tested mowing, which might replicate some fire effects
   more cheaply and safely. Twenty-five experimental blocks were
   established within open pine stands with ground vegetation including
   bilberry, but dominated by heather Calluna vulgaris. Each block held
   three 700 m(2) plots, randomly assigned to control, mow and burn.
   Vegetation, arthropods and capercaillie dung were monitored over a
   7-year period, including 1 year prior to treatment. Mean bilberry cover,
   initially around 12\%, increased in mown and burnt areas, but there were
   also increases in controls, following unusual natural die-back of
   heather. By the sixth season after treatment, bilberry cover was

   capercaillie chicks, as measured by pitfall trapping, was significantly
   higher in burnt and mown plots than controls, by about 56\% (38-76).
   However, biomass of caterpillars, often considered a more important
   dietary group, did not show clear differences between treatments. An
   alternative analysis was used to `statistically remove' natural heather
   die-back; this enhanced the treatment differences in bilberry cover and
   spider biomass. Capercaillie dung counts suggested that burnt, and
   especially mown areas, had more summer capercaillie usage than controls.
   Capercaillie conservation at sites similar to Abernethy is likely to
   benefit from either prescribed fire or mowing, because these techniques
   increase bilberry and spider abundance. This study illustrates the value
   of collaboration between researchers and land-managers, in developing
   and testing novel management techniques. We support the idea that
   `dominance reduction', delivered through managed disturbance, offers a
   general principle to guide land-managers wishing to maintain
   biodiversity, particularly where key species, like capercaillie, are
   strongly associated with sub-dominant plant species like bilberry. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: The coexistence of woody vegetation and grass is a key
   characteristic of savanna ecological balance. Gains in woody vegetation
   at the expense of grass can lead to changes in grazer and browser
   carrying capacities on the savannas. This study examined long-term
   change in woody cover at four study sites representative of the geology
   and rainfall in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Scanned
   1940/1942, 1968, and 1977 high spatial resolution (0.44-1.35 m)
   panchromatic aerial photographs were used, supplemented by 5 and 10 m
   resolution 1998 and 2012 panchromatic and red band grey scale digital
   SPOT images. The imagery datasets of the respective study sites were
   georeferenced to the UTM projection. Woody cover on the imagery was
   enhanced using texture analysis, and mapped by unsupervised
   classification of the texture images using the K-means clustering
   algorithm. Change in woody cover was mapped using Boolean addition
   Geographic Information System overlay analysis. R
   esults: The results indicated 29 and 40 \% reductions in woody cover for
   the southern granites and southern basalts sites, respectively. The
   northern granites and northern basalts sites, on the other hand, had
   gains in woody cover over the analysis period. The location
   context-specific factors of fire frequency and elephant density, and not
   rainfall fluctuations, explained most of the change in woody cover.
   Conclusions: The results point to the need for location context-specific
   management of fire and elephant concentrations. The changes in woody
   cover are likely to have effects on the grazer and browser carrying
   capacities of the savannas in the Kruger National Park.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological integrity of the Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and A. Young) alliance is
   being severely interrupted by post-fire invasion of non-native annual
   grasses. To curtail this invasion, successful post-fire revegetation of
   perennial grasses is required. Environmental factors impacting post-fire
   restoration success vary across space within the Wyoming big sagebrush
   alliance; however, most restorative management practices are applied
   uniformly. Our objectives were to define probability of revegetation
   success over space using relevant soil-related environmental factors,
   use this information to model cost of successful revegetation and
   compare the importance of vegetation competition and soil factors to
   revegetation success. We studied a burned Wyoming big sagebrush
   landscape in southeast Oregon that was reseeded with perennial grasses.
   We collected soil and vegetation data at plots spaced at 30 m intervals
   along a 1.5 km transect in the first two years post-burn. Plots were
   classified as successful (> 5 seedlings/m(2)) or unsuccessful based on
   density of seeded species. Using logistic regression we found that
   abundance of competing vegetation correctly predicted revegetation
   success on 51 \% of plots, and soil-related variables correctly
   predicted revegetation performance on 82.4 \% of plots. Revegetation
   estimates varied from \$167.06 to \$43,033.94/ha across the 1.5 km
   transect based on probability of success, but were more homogenous at
   larger scales. Our experimental protocol provides managers with a
   technique to identify important environmental drivers of restoration
   success and this process will be of value for spatially allocating
   logistical and capital expenditures in a variable restoration
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The young successional stages of boreal forests are an important habitat
   for many saproxylic species. These habitats are formed by disturbances
   such as forest fires and they are characterized by large volumes of dead
   wood and sun-exposed conditions. Today, young successional stages of
   natural origin are very rare in Fennoscandia and there is need for
   restoration. We constructed a large-scale field experiment in which we
   studied the effects of two restoration practices on beetle diversity:
   controlled burning and partial harvesting with creating different
   volumes of dead wood. We sampled beetles with flight-intercept traps
   recording a total of 56,031 individuals and 755 species. The species
   richness and abundance of both saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetles
   were increased by burning and harvesting but the volume of dead wood
   created on harvested sites had no short-term effect on species richness
   or abundance. Rare species, especially saproxylic ones, preferred burned
   sites and a similar trend was observed among red-listed and pyrophilous
   species. Burning and harvesting also resulted in different species
   assemblages and there were some additional differences according to the
   volume of dead wood. We conclude that fire can be successfully used in
   restoration of managed boreal forests to increase species diversity and
   to facilitate the recovery of declined species. However, long-term
   monitoring is needed to clarify the effects of the restoration
   practices, in particular those of creating dead wood without using fire.}},

Title = {{Variation in habitat management alters risk aversion behavior in lizards}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Habitat management can generate variation in a cascade of organismal
   traits linked to the environment, particularly in small, endemic species
   such as the Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi). For example,
   reduction of arboreal perches through clear-cutting in managed Florida
   scrub may alter lizard behavior, and predation risk, which in turn, may
   alter lizard abundance. We ask whether risk aversion behavior is
   habitat-specific, and potentially reflects predation intensity. Four
   predator avoidance traits were quantified in S. woodi from longleaf pine
   and Florida scrub habitats. We also asked if habitat type was linked to
   phenotypic traits (e.g., body size, hind limb length) that might alter
   risk aversion behaviors. Lizards in longleaf pine had greater detection
   distance and flight distance and were farther from refuges, indicating
   higher risk aversion compared to populations in Florida scrub. Given
   this, males may be more sensitive to predation than females, especially
   during the breeding season. Males were encountered more often than
   females in both habitats, and detected from a greater distance in
   longleaf, but not Florida scrub. Population density may affect lizard
   behavior, yet we found no difference in population density between the
   habitats for stands sampled, nor any relationship of population density
   to risk aversion behaviors. These results demonstrate that management
   activities, which alter vegetation and substrate characteristics, also
   alter aspects of lizard behavior that subsequently may influence
   predation pressure among sub-populations.
   Human activity has fundamentally changed most habitats on Earth such
   that management is now required for conservation of native species and
   preservation of resources. We hypothesized that differential management
   between longleaf pine and Florida scrub habitats might alter risk
   aversion behavior. Our results show that lizards use different refuges
   between habitat types, and that lizards are more weary in the more open
   habitat (longleaf pine). Frequent prescribed fire in longleaf pine
   maintains a suitable thermal microclimate and access to key refuges
   (mature trees), whereas clear-cutting of Florida scrub yields more
   shrubs, no vertical perches, and higher temperatures. Thus, habitat
   management fundamentally alters predator avoidance behavior, which in
   turn is linked to predation intensity and the probability of population
   persistence. This study highlights the challenge of designing management
   plans that are beneficial to all constituent species.}},

Abstract = {{In burned forestlands, fire scar wounds commonly occur on tree stems as
   a result of cambial heating. In hardwood forests in particular, wounding
   can lead to stem decay with the extent of decay being related to scar
   size and exposure time. Therefore, wound closure rates are important to
   understand in the context of fire management such that allowing
   sufficient time for wound closure to occur between fires would enhance
   wood quality. Conversely, in the context of wildlife management,
   understanding wound closure rates would improve fire prescriptions
   needed for creating basal tree cavities as keeping wounds open prior to
   wound closure could enhance cavity development. The objectives of this
   study were to quantify growth and wound closure rates of white oaks
   ((Nereus alba), one of the most valuable tree species in the central
   U.S. to both commercial forestry and wildlife. From historically burned,
   mature, oak-hickory forest site in Missouri, we sampled a wide range of
   tree sizes, fire scar sizes, and fire scar ages to determine the
   environmental and tree factors related to closure rates.
   Dendrochronological techniques were paired with new approaches of
   digitizing tree rings to capture malformed woundwood areas. The time
   required for wound closure ranged from 1 to 24 years and was
   significantly correlated to scar size. Surprisingly, post-fire growth
   trends were positive following scarring. Growth was positively related
   to scar and tree size. With this information, we expect that the process
   of basal wound closure and tree growth can be considered in a
   quantitative framework and used to guide fire management for wood
   quality or wildlife tree cavities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fire suppression has increased stand density and risk of severe,
   stand-replacing wildfire in lower elevation dry conifer forests of
   western North America, threatening ecological function. The U.S. Forest
   Service's Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP)
   aims to mitigate impacts to ecological function, while mandating
   effectiveness monitoring to verify restoration success. Expected
   benefits include improved conditions for biodiversity, but relatively
   few empirical studies evaluate restoration effects on biodiversity. We
   applied the Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program
   to survey birds in relation to CFLRP treatments along the Colorado Front
   Range in 2015-2017. We employed hierarchical models to analyze species
   occupancy and richness at 1972 points nested within 141 1-km(2) grid
   cells. Our objectives were to investigate (1) species occupancy
   relationships with treatments at local (point) and landscape (grid)
   spatial scales, (2) potential mechanisms for treatment relationships
   considering species and treatment relationships with forest structure
   and composition (i.e., habitat relationships), and (3) treatment and
   habitat relationships with species richness. The data supported positive
   and negative point-level treatment relationships, suggesting uneven
   species distributions between treated and untreated points. At the grid
   scale, however, we only found positive species relationships with
   percent area treated, and accordingly, grid-level species richness
   increased with treatment extent. Potential mechanisms for treatment
   relationships included treatments generating foraging opportunities for
   aerial insectivores by opening the canopy, improving conditions for
   ground-associated species by increasing herbaceous growth, and limiting
   opportunities for shrub-nesting species by reducing shrub cover.
   Landscape-scale patterns suggest CFLRP treatments can benefit avian
   communities by generating habitat for open-forest species without
   necessarily eliminating habitat for closed-forest species. Our results
   provide evidence for a commonly expected but rarely verified pattern of
   increased species richness with forest heterogeneity. We suggest
   restoration treatments will most benefit forest bird diversity by
   reducing canopy cover, encouraging herbaceous ground cover, limiting
   ladder fuel species, and encouraging shrub diversity in canopy openings,
   while maintaining some dense forest stands on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of late-successional and old-growth forest ecosystems is a
   key objective of the Northwest Forest Plan (Plan). The Plan specifies a
   spatial array of Late Successional Reserves (LSRs) to help achieve this
   objective. Under the Plan, management options within LSRs are limited to
   the maintenance or development of spotted owl (Strix occidentalis
   caurina) habitat. Forests constituting spotted owl habitat on the east
   side of the Cascade Range in Washington and Oregon are more stressed for
   moisture than are forests in LSRs on the west side of the crest. The
   absence of disturbance, such as forest fire, has resulted in a greater
   proportion of late-successional forest stands. These stands have a
   greater proportion of shade-tolerant tree species, the majority of which
   is grand fir (Abies grandis). The grand fir in the Gotchen LSR is
   late-successional in nature and provides habitat for the northern
   spotted owl. Spotted owl habitat is at risk because of tree mortality.
   LSR function and legacy tree structure may also be at risk because of
   stand replacement crown fire. The legacy trees exceed 150 years in age.
   Nest sites in the Gotchen landscape are closely associated with this
   legacy structure. The trajectory of a substantial portion of the grand
   fir forest in the Gotchen LSR is continued tree mortality and increasing
   fuel loading. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a stand-scale
   treatment that will (1) maintain spotted owl foraging habitat, (2)
   increase the likelihood of stand recovery to late successional
   condition, (3) decrease the likelihood of crown fire, and (4) decrease
   spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis) risk.}},

Abstract = {{1. Invasion by alien plant species represents a challenge to land
   managers throughout the world as they attempt to restore frequent
   fire-adapted ecosystems following decades of fire exclusion. In
   ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa forests of western North America, the
   response of alien species to restoration treatments has not been well
   documented, particularly for alien species capable of altering
   environmental conditions (transformers). Understanding alien species
   dynamics is critical for developing treatments that accomplish
   restoration goals while minimizing alien invasion.
   2. We used a replicated, randomized block experiment to compare the
   effects of an untreated control and thin-only, burn-only and thin-burn
   treatments on alien and transformer understorey species at multiple
   spatial scales (1 m(2), 100 m(2) and 1000 m(2)). Data were collected
   pre-treatment and for multiple post-treatment years. We compared
   richness and cover of alien species and transformer species among
   treatments, and identified environmental variables correlated with
   transformer species cover. Indicator species analysis was used to
   identify transformer species associated with specific treatments.
   3. Alien and transformer species richness and cover were significantly
   higher in the thin-burn than in all other treatments at all spatial
   scales. Thin-only and burn-only treatments showed greater alien and
   transformer species responses than the control at the larger 100-m(2)
   and 1000-m(2) scales.
   4. Increased transformer cover was strongly correlated with increased
   tree crown scorch height and removal of overstorey trees.
   5. The thin-burn treatment had four transformer species as indicators,
   the thin-only had one, while the burn-only and control had none.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The results show that alien species,
   including transformers, respond to restoration treatments, especially
   the combined thin-burn treatment. Therefore monitoring for alien species
   invasion is an essential component of a restoration programme. Abundance
   of transformer species increased with increasing disturbance intensity,
   suggesting that less intense single-disturbance treatments (burn-only,
   thin-only) or incremental treatments may be preferred in some
   applications. Where more intense treatments are required to meet
   management objectives, specific strategies, such as seeding of native
   species, limiting grazing before and after treatment and harvesting over
   a protective winter snowpack, may be necessary to limit alien invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What is the effect of fuel management practices in the

   Location: Ulex parviflorus shrubland localities in Mediterranean regions

   Methods: We applied prescribed burning and brush-chipping as fuel
   management techniques in three young and three mature shrublands, and
   evaluated the effects in the following four years.
   Results: Canopy opening by the treatments allowed increasing species
   richness through the four years of secondary succession. The treatments
   produced a change in community structure and dominant species, from the
   woody seeder Ulex parviflorus to the resprouter grass Brachypodium
   retusum. Vegetation response was conditioned by both shrubland
   developmental stage and treatment applied. Burning resulted in more
   severe modification of the ecosystem, increasing bare soil cover. Four
   years after fuel management in different aged Mediterranean gorse
   shrublands, vegetation response followed a similar pattern with the
   exception of the young, brush-chipped shrublands. The treatments applied
   for controlling Ulex parviflorus were seen to be very effective, with
   the exception of brush-chipping in young shrublands.
   Conclusions: Selective brush-chipping in middle-aged or mature gorse

Abstract = {{Throughout the United States, declines in breeding populations of
   grassland and shrubland birds have prompted conservation agencies and
   organizations to manage and restore early-successional habitats. These
   habitats support a variety of birds, some of which have been classified
   as generalists; thus, often these birds are thought to be less affected
   by habitat manipulation. More information, however, is needed on the
   response of early-successional generalists to habitat management,
   because conservation agencies are increasing their focus on the regional
   preservation and management of common species. On Nantucket Island,
   Massachusetts, the goal of the Partnership for Harrier Habitat
   Preservation (PHHP) has been to restore more than 373 ha of grassland
   for the island's population of Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus). This
   management program has entailed methods such as prescribed burning and
   mowing (e.g., brushcutting) to restore and maintain grassland habitat.
   Over a 3-year period, we found that songbird response to burning and
   mowing varied among species, depending on subtle habitat preferences and
   the intensity and type of management. In shrublands, Eastern Towhee
   (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) and Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas)
   abundance declined in mowed areas but were unaffected by prescribed
   burning, In grasslands, Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis)
   abundance showed no response to either burning or mowing, whereas Song
   Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) preferred unmanaged grasslands. In
   shrublands, mowing was the most effective method for restoring grassland
   habitat, whereas prescribed burning had little effect on abundances of
   shrubland birds and vegetation structure. In grasslands, both mowing and
   burning were successful in restricting shrubland encroachment and

Abstract = {{Research Highlights:Forest management is trending toward creating
   multi-aged forest structures and diverse vegetative compositions. The
   challenge is successfully designing and implementing treatments that
   create these diverse forests. Regeneration establishment is the most
   important step when applying a silvicultural system because it
   determines future treatments and optimizes management options. This
   study provided the minimum canopy openings that favor the establishment
   of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species to inform the
   implementation of uneven-aged management.Background and Objectives: A
   replicated study was implemented in 2007 in moist mixed-conifer forests
   to design, apply, and test two silvicultural concepts, canopy opening
   size and site preparation. Our objective in 2015 was to evaluate tree
   regeneration establishment and growth and understory vegetation in
   relation to these two silvicultural concepts.Materials and Methods:
   Canopy opening sizes as measured by lidar ranged from 15\% to 100\%; and
   through the application of prescribed fire, mastication, pile and burn,
   or no site preparation, different combinations of forest floor
   substrates were created. We stratified our study area into five canopy
   opening classes and four site preparation treatments. Using this
   stratified sampling scheme, we located 65 plots and measured tree
   species, abundance, 5-year height growth, and vegetative
   lifeforms.Results:The pile and burn site preparation favored the
   establishment of all six tree species. The canopy opening size of 55\%
   to 92\% favored the regeneration of both shade-tolerant and
   shade-intolerant species. Grand-fir 5-year height growth was
   significantly influenced by site preparation and canopy opening, and
   western white pine 5-year height growth was only influenced by canopy
   opening. Treatments did not influence vegetative
   richness.Conclusions:This study provided key treatment parameters in
   designing the regeneration step for uneven-aged management strategies
   with the goal of creating vegetative diversity and establishing
   shade-intolerant tree species in moist mixed-conifer forests.}},

Title = {{The effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities in

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{1. Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry
   practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons.
   However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally
   considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many
   open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes.
   Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can
   create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire
   salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2. We surveyed breeding
   birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western
   Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and
   vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and
   community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental
   before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird
   community during the first three springs after fire. 3. Most bird
   species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a
   relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for
   open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were
   positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged
   areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged
   areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the
   first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to
   the third. 4. Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species,
   although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the
   specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5.
   Synthesis and applications. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire
   salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird
   conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees
   during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with
   unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range
   of species.}},

Abstract = {{Many traditional land management activities and supporting research have
   concentrated on one or two resources, with limited evaluations of
   interactions among other potential values. An ecosystem approach to land
   management requires an evaluation of the blend of physical and
   biological factors needed to assure productive, healthy ecosystems.
   Ideally, social and economic values also should be considered. The U. S.
   Department of Agriculture Forest Service's Coronado National Forest and
   its partners have just completed a draft for the Peloncillo Programmatic
   Fire Plan to address fire management strategies for this mountain range,
   which lies along the southern Arizona-New Mexico border. The plan was
   designed to reintroduce prescribed or managed fires into an area where
   wildfires have been excluded since the late 19(th) century. One
   persistent question concerned the impacts of cool-season
   (November-April) and warm-season (May-October) fires on the oak (Quercus
   spp.) ecosystems that are common throughout these mountains. Fires
   normally occur in June or early July before the summer monsoon rains.
   However, hotter warm-season fires could damage important wildlife
   habitats by killing larger numbers of standing trees and shrubs used as
   nesting sites or cover or as sources of food, and thus some managers
   prefer burning during the cooler season.
   The Rocky Mountain Research Station's Southwestern Borderlands Ecosystem
   Management Project and its cooperators have initiated a research program
   to evaluate the impacts of season of burning on a large number of
   ecosystem components, including hydrology, sedimentation, vegetation,
   soil nutrient dynamics, small and large mammals, birds, and snakes and
   other reptiles. Our research is concentrated on 12 small, gauged
   watersheds that support oak savannas or open woodlands. We plan to burn
   four watersheds in the warm season, burn four in the cool season, and
   leave four as controls. The watershed and companion studies are
   currently in the pre-burn calibration phase. However, little is actually
   known about the oak ecosystems of the southwestern United States and
   northern Mexico, where most of these oak stands are found. The
   preliminary results have provided important new information about these
   lands. This paper describes the studies and initial results obtained
   during the pre-treatment phase of this project.}},

Title = {{Detecting tree mortality with Landsat-derived spectral indices:
   Improving ecological accuracy by examining uncertainty}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{237}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Satellite-derived fire severity metrics are a foundational tool used to
   estimate fire effects at the landscape scale. Changes in surface
   characteristics permit reasonably accurate delineation between burned
   and unburned areas, but variability in severity within burned areas is
   much more challenging to detect. Previous studies have relied primarily
   on categorical data to calibrate severity indices in terms of
   classification accuracy, but this approach does not readily translate
   into an expected amount of error in terms of actual tree mortality. We
   addressed this issue by examining a dataset of 40,370 geolocated trees
   that burned in the 2013 California Rim Fire using 36 Landsat-derived
   burn severity indices.
   The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) performed reliably well,
   but the differenced SWIR:NIR ratio most accurately predicted percent
   basal area mortality and the differenced normalized vegetation index
   (dNDVI) most accurately predicted percent mortality of stems >= 10 cm
   diameter at breast height. Relativized versions of dNBR did not
   consistently improve accuracy; the relativized burn ratio (RBR) was
   generally equivalent to dNBR while RdNBR had consistently lower
   accuracy.
   There was a high degree of variability in observed tree mortality,
   especially at intermediate spectral index values. This translated into a
   considerable amount of uncertainty at the landscape scale, with an
   expected range in estimated percent basal area mortality greater than
   37\% for half of the area burned (> 50,000 ha). In other words, a 37\%
   range in predicted mortality rate was insufficient to capture the
   observed mortality rate for half of the area burned. Uncertainty was
   even greater for percent stem mortality, with half of the area burned
   exceeding a 46\% range in predicted mortality rate. The high degree of
   uncertainty in tree mortality that we observed challenges the confidence
   with which Landsat-derived spectral indices have been used to measure
   fire effects, and this has broad implications for research and
   management related to post-fire landscape complexity, distribution of
   seed sources, or persistence of fire refugia. We suggest ways to account
   for uncertainty that will facilitate a more nuanced and
   ecologically-accurate interpretation of fire effects.
   This study makes three key contributions to the field of remote sensing
   of fire effects: 1) we conducted the most comprehensive comparison to
   date of all previously published severity indices using the largest
   contiguous set of georeferenced tree mortality field data and revealed
   that the accuracy of both absolute and relative spectral indices depends
   on the tree mortality metric of interest;2) we conducted this study in a
   single, large fire that enabled us to isolate variability due to
   intrinsic, within-landscape factors without the additional variance due
   to extrinsic factors associated with different biogeographies or
   climatic conditions; and 3) we identified the range in tree mortality
   that may be indistinguishable based on spectral indices derived from
   Landsat satellites, and we demonstrated how this variability translates
   into a considerable amount of uncertainty in fire effects at the
   landscape scale.}},

Abstract = {{Native grassland communities controlled by public agencies become
   increasingly important to the maintenance of many wildlife species as
   privately owned grasslands are destroyed or degraded for farming,
   mining, and development. In turn, wildlife on publicly owned grasslands
   are affected by the management techniques practiced by local managers.
   We studied the effects of grazing and prescribed burning on
   upland-nesting ducks and the structure and type of vegetation from 1980
   to 1988 at the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in northwestern
   North Dakota. Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the most abundant species at
   Lostwood NWR, had lower (P < 0.05) annual nest densities on experimental
   and control fields in the later years than in the early years of the
   study. Spring burning reduced (P = 0.016) nest densities of gadwall (A.
   strepera). Spring grazing reduced nest densities of gadwall (P = 0.014),
   and blue-winged teal (A. discors, P = 0.023). Nest density of gadwall
   increased (P = 0.018) after spring grazing was terminated. On the summer
   burn/spring graze fields, blue-winged teal had lower (P = 0.010) nest
   densities after treatments (1987-88) than before treatments (1980-81).
   Nest success was high (mallard 34\%, gadwall 45\%, blue-winged teal
   31\%) but was not influenced (P greater than or equal to 0.16) by the
   burning and grazing treatments. During the study, the amount of
   grass/brush increased, whereas the amount of brush and brush/grass
   decreased on control and treatment fields. During the years with burning
   and grazing, short vegetation increased and tall vegetation decreased.
   On the spring graze fields, 1 year after grazing ended the vegetation
   was similar to that on the control fields. The spring burn and summer
   burn/spring graze fields recovered more slowly. Brushy species such as
   western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) provided attractive
   nesting habitat for many upland-nesting waterfowl species, especially
   mallard, gadwall, American wigeon (A. americana), and northern pintail
   (A. acuta). Habitat needs of additional species of wildlife that depend
   on grasslands may need to be considered when deciding how to manage
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of the endangered Leadbeater's Possum, Gymnobelideus
   leadbeateri is one of the most contentious forestry issues in Australia.
   The challenge is to identify strategies to conserve the species in the
   significant portion of its range in the central highlands of Victoria
   (southeastern Australia) where timber harvesting occurs. We used ALEX, a
   simulation program for population viability analysis to explore the
   effectiveness of potential forest management strategies to enhance the
   Persistence of G. leadbeateti in areas of wood production. Our study
   focused on the relationship between the risk of metapopulation
   extinction and (1) the number and spatial arrangement of 50-ha logging
   areas that could be reserved from timber harvesting and (2) the impacts
   of postfire salvage logging in reserved areas We modeled complex patch
   structures within two forest blocks (Murrindindi and Steavenson) that
   were based on maps of both existing patches of suitable habitat for G.
   leadbeateri and the location of potential logging areas We recorded high
   values for the probability of extinction of metapopulations of G.
   leadbeateri when existing strategies for the conservation of the species
   within the Murrindindi and Steavenson Forest Blocks were modeled
   Exclusion of salvage logging operations from burned, old-growth forests
   significantly improved the species' prospects of survival in both the
   short and long term. Withdrawal of timber harvesting from some proposed
   logging coupes made a significant, positive long-term contribution to
   metapopulation persistence. But there will be a delay of at least 150
   years until areas set aside note maize a significant contribution to
   metapopulation persistence. This is the time required for existing
   stands of regrowth to develop old-growth characteristics that are an
   essential habitat component for G. leadbeateri We examined the
   effectiveness of different designs for setting aside a total reserved
   area of 300 ha. These ranged from a single 300 ha reserve to 12, 25-ha
   reserves Populations in smaller reserves were vulnerable to extinction
   front demographic stochasticity and environmental variability.
   Conversely, a small number of larger reserves were susceptible to
   destruction in a single, catastrophic wildfire, highlighting the need
   for several dispersed reserves. Analyses of the sensitivity of various
   management options to variations in fire frequency and extent, movement
   capability and a wide range of other factors indicated that the
   conservation strategy that gave the best relative outcome for G.
   leadbeateri was both to set aside several 50 to 100-ha reserves in every
   forest block and to preclude post-fire salvage logging operations from
   these areas if they burned in a wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Regional conservation planning frequently relies on general assumptions
   about historical disturbance regimes to inform decisions about landscape
   restoration, reserve allocations, and landscape management. Spatially
   explicit simulations of landscape dynamics provide quantitative

   estimate the historical range of variability of vegetation and fire in a
   dry forest landscape (size ca. 7900 km(2)) where the present-day risk of
   high severity fire threatens the persistence of older closed canopy
   forest which may serve as Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis

   may have comprised the largest percentage of the landscape (similar to
   35\%), followed by early successional forest (similar to 25\%), with
   about 9\% of the landscape in a closed canopy older forest condition.
   The amount and condition of older forest varied by potential vegetation
   type and land use allocation type. Vegetation successional stages had
   fine-grained spatial heterogeneity in patch characteristics, with older
   forest tending to have the largest patch sizes among the successional

Abstract = {{Nest predation is often the primary cause of avian nest failure, and
   factors influencing nest predation are diverse. To better understand how
   forest management practices, weather, and indices of nest predator
   abundance influence nest predation, we set artificial ground nests at
   100 sites for 2 weeks each summer from 2002 to 2013 in a longleaf
   pine/wiregrass ecosystem. We modeled effects of prescribed fire,
   hardwood removal, rainfall, temperature, indices of mammalian and avian
   nest predator abundance, and proximity to wildlife food plots and
   agriculture, edges, and roads on nest predation. Annual nest predation
   rates ranged from 30\% to 74\% and averaged 53\%. Occurrence of
   prescribed fire at a nest site <2 months prior to nest placement had a
   strong, positive association with nest predation but prescribed fires
   carried out >2 months prior to nest placement had little effect.
   Hardwood removal was also associated with increased rates of nest
   predation, but this effect appeared most prevalent 4-9 years following
   removals. Nest predation rates also increased when food plots or
   agricultural fields were within 50 m of nest sites. Higher temperatures
   were associated with greater rates of predation, but rainfall did not
   have a significant influence. There was a general lack of support for
   effects of predator indices on nest predation rates, except for a weak,
   negative association with raccoon relative abundance. This study shows
   the wide range of factors which may influence nest predation and

Abstract = {{Human induced climate and land-use change are severely impacting global
   biodiversity, but how community composition and richness of multiple
   taxonomic groups change in response to local drivers and whether these
   responses are synchronous remains unclear. We used long-term
   community-level data from an experimentally manipulated grassland to
   assess the relative influence of climate and land use as drivers of
   community structure of four taxonomic groups: birds, mammals,
   grasshoppers, and plants. We also quantified the synchrony of responses
   among taxonomic groups across land-use gradients and compared climatic
   drivers of community structure across groups. All four taxonomic groups
   responded strongly to land use (fire frequency and grazing), while
   responses to climate variability were more pronounced in grasshoppers
   and small mammals. Animal groups exhibited asynchronous responses across
   all land-use treatments, but plant and animal groups, especially birds,
   exhibited synchronous responses in composition. Asynchrony was
   attributed to taxonomic groups responding to different components of
   climate variability, including both current climate conditions and
   lagged effects from the previous year. Data-driven land management
   strategies are crucial for sustaining native biodiversity in grassland
   systems, but asynchronous responses of taxonomic groups to climate
   variability across land-use gradients highlight a need to incorporate
   response heterogeneity into management planning.}},

Title = {{Winter foraging ecology of Greater Sage-Grouse in a post-fire landscape}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{178}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the Great Basin, changes in climate and associated fire regimes may
   alter the density and distribution of shrubs, changing the structure and
   diet quality of plants in burned areas. We evaluated how the structural
   and phytochemical characteristics of three-tip sagebrush (Artemisia
   tripartita) relative to Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata
   wyomingensis) influence the winter foraging ecology of Greater
   Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) at a site with a known history
   of fire in south-central Idaho. Three-tip sagebrush had lower protein
   content and lower chemical defenses compared to Wyoming big sagebrush.
   We found that time since last fire over a 30-year history was more
   strongly correlated with changes in phytochemicals in three-tip
   sagebrush compared to Wyoming big sagebrush. Despite phytochemical
   differences, both Wyoming big sagebrush and three-tip sagebrush were
   browsed relative to their availability. However, within a species,
   smaller plant height and lower concentrations of phytochemicals,
   specifically two individual monoterpenes, explained diet selection by
   sage-grouse. Our results indicate that dietary quality of three-tip
   sagebrush may provide acceptable forage for sage-grouse in post-fire
   landscapes where other species of sagebrush have not yet recovered.
   However, relying on reestablishment of one species of sagebrush without
   consideration of structural and dietary quality may compromise
   successful conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal wetlands in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain commonly are managed
   intensively by fall or winter burning and constructing impoundments to
   improve habitat for wintering waterfowl, reduce wetland loss, and create
   emergent wetlands. However, little information is available on effects
   of these management practices on plant or bird communities during
   summer. We conducted experimental burns in 4 types of impounded and
   unimpounded marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwestern
   Louisiana. We recorded vegetation characteristics and species
   composition and relative abundance of plants and birds during April-lune
   1996-1998. We found that vegetation characteristics in burned marshes
   did not differ from those of unburned marshes by the first summer
   post-burn and that winter burning did not affect bird species richness
   or species composition. Birds/survey for all species combined and for
   sparrows (primarily seaside sparrows {[}Ammodramus maritimus]) did not
   differ between burned and unburned marshes during the first or third
   summers post-burn, but were 2 times greater in burned than in unburned
   marshes during the second summer post-burn. Our results indicate that
   winter burning for waterfowl is compatible with management for other
   marsh birds, provided that measures ensuring sufficient winter cover for
   passerines are included in management plans. Number of icterids/survey
   was greatest and sparrows/survey was least in intermediate impounded
   marshes compared to other marsh-management types. Sparrows generally
   were most abundant in brackish and saline unimpounded marshes,
   indicating that continued loss of unimpounded marsh habitat could impact
   coastal sparrow populations.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is generally acknowledged that fire-induced heterogeneity is
   important for maintaining diverse species assemblages in northern
   Australian savannas, scant relevant data are currently available to
   examine this proposition. The study takes advantage of a singular,
   detailed, bidecadal fire history assembled annually for Kakadu National
   Park to explore relationships between fire-induced heterogeneity and
   other terrain features. Three patch-based heterogeneity indices were
   calculated from assembled fire-history data for the central 1-ha cell of
   a 5 x 5 cell (25 ha) window; that is, at a spatial scale relevant to the
   home ranges of many small- to medium-sized native mammals. Two of these
   indices were first calculated separately for each year, employing
   different metrics based on the extent of burning occurring in the 5 x 5
   cell array, and then averaged for each of four consecutive five-year
   periods and over all years. The third index was calculated as the sum of
   the coefficients of variation for four fire-regime variability
   parameters determined likewise for five- and 20-year periods. Assembled
   data illustrate that (1) fire-induced heterogeneity in Kakadu increased
   in each successive five-year period from 1981, and (2) when modelled
   with independent terrain coverages, significant relationships were
   obtained for all three heterogeneity indices with terrain roughness,
   distance to roads, and distance to drainage lines.}},

Abstract = {{Raptors are emblematic species of high conservation value and
   significant ecological role. Their conservation is of particular
   importance and it relies on the conservation of their habitats and the
   constant monitoring of their dynamics. In the current study we
   investigate land cover changes over the period 2001-2011, in one of the
   most important reserves for raptor conservation in Europe, the
   Dadia-Lefldmi-Soufli Forest National Park. Very high and high spatial
   resolution satellite data were integrated in a single analysis, in order
   to exploit the high spatial accuracy of the former and the high temporal
   and spectral resolution of the latter. The results suggest that the
   applied method increases the overall accuracy of the mapping product
   from 73\% to 89\%, providing a tool to land managers and
   conservationists to study landscape dynamics and guide wildlife
   management. The analysis of land use changes revealed that wildfires of
   high intensity and large extent, constitute a new threat for the
   ecological integrity of the reserve. If the currently observed trend of
   wildfire behavior in Greece and southern Europe continues it is likely
   to affect the core zones of forest reserve, which consist primarily by
   dense forests with high fuel load, with detrimental effects for
   wildlife. The most important land cover change observed is the
   significant reduction of open areas, which form the main hunting areas
   for raptors. Open areas appear to be encroached by forest, leading to
   loss of heterogeneity which has been reported to be associated with high
   biodiversity. The results reveal the need for more active management
   measures that would decrease the risk of large stand replacing fires and
   would ensure a suitable landscape structure for raptors.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent prescribed fire (3 yr) and selective harvest of off-site
   hardwoods are the primary restoration and management tools for pine
   (Pinus spp.) savannas in the southeastern United States. However, a
   knowledge gap exists in our understanding of eastern wild turkey
   (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) habitat selection in longleaf pine
   savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management
   decisions. Therefore, we investigated habitat selection of female
   turkeys in 2 longleaf pine savanna systems managed by frequent fire in
   southwestern Georgia during 2011-2013. We observed differential habitat
   selection across 2 scales (study area and seasonal area of use) and 3
   seasons (fall-winter: 1 Oct-30 Jan; pre-breeding: 1 Feb-19 Apr; and
   summer: 16 Jun-30 Sep). During fall-winter, turkeys selected mature
   pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, and young pine stands, albeit at
   different scales. During pre-breeding, turkeys selected for mature pine,
   mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and shrub-scrub, although
   at different scales. During summer, turkeys also demonstrated
   scale-specific selection but generally selected for mature pine,
   hardwoods, and shrub-scrub. Days-since-fire did not influence selection
   of stands managed by frequent fire (3 yr). In cases where female turkeys
   used pine-dominated stands (i.e., mature pine, young pine, and mixed
   pine-hardwoods), selection was not influenced by days-since-fire;
   however, these results are at least partially due to a lack of longer
   burn rotations (>3 yr) on our study areas. We suggest land managers
   consider scale of selection by turkeys when developing habitat
   management strategies. In addition to creating early successional
   habitat conditions by using prescribed fire, we recommend managers
   retain hardwoods and recognize the importance of shrub-scrub cover to
   management of turkey populations in longleaf pine savannas. (c) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Wildlife populations throughout the world are under pressure as human
   activities expand into previously natural ecosystems. Human population
   growth is resulting in the rapid development of sensitive coastal
   regions that frequently coincide with areas of high biodiversity and
   significant populations of fauna - such as koalas (Phascolarctos
   cinereus). As a consequence, these wildlife populations are increasingly
   faced with a range of threats associated with anthropogenic activity.
   While land clearing for urban development results in direct impacts on
   wildlife populations through habitat loss, the associated effects,
   including habitat fragmentation and elevated levels of anthropogenic
   mortality are indirect, insidious and much more difficult to detect or
   quantify.
   Habitat loss has long been regarded as the single biggest threat to the
   persistence of many species, and the main factor responsible for
   declining koala populations. Clearing not only results in net loss of
   habitat, but the fragmentation of the remaining habitat also contributes
   to a permanent decrease in population size and reduced long term
   population viability. Degradation of habitat is often associated with
   fragmentation through edge effects, or through logging regimes,
   thinning; destruction of mid-storey shelter trees; fire regimes;
   excessive nutrient input; or introduction of weeds (ANZECC 1998). As a
   consequence of urban development, koala populations have to contend with
   the additional threats posed by vehicles, dogs and disease, which are
   frequently regarded as the main agents of injury and mortality of koalas
   in or near urban areas (Martin and Handasyde 1999).
   This study relates the spatial pattern of threats to wildlife
   populations with landscape processes culminating in localised
   extinctions. By examining both habitat fragmentation effects and the
   major causes of koala mortality (vehicle, dog and disease) the study
   provides information and techniques to develop management options for
   wildlife populations in rapidly urbanising areas.
   In the Koala Coast region of South East Queensland, threats to koalas
   were modelled spatially by integrating a forest fragmentation model
   derived from Landsat TM satellite imagery with threat surface models
   derived from koala mortality reports. To determine whether the spatial
   patterns could be related to ecological processes, evidence of localised
   koala extinctions was also investigated.
   The fragmentation model identified and mapped six categories of
   fragmentation and also provided valuable contextual and descriptive
   information, essential for assessing potential impacts and management
   decisions. The Koala Coast was found to be highly fragmented, with only
   21\% of the study area classified as ``interior forest{''} which
   represents the most suitable habitat for koalas. By identifying
   ``hotspots{''}, or spatial concentrations of threats from the surface
   models using GIS, it was possible to estimate that the anthropogenic
   mortality risk in the high threat zone (4.5 koala 100ha(-1) yr(-1)) was
   7.5 times higher than the low threat zone. These threats are already
   impacting on koala population viability, with 18\% +/- 5\% of the Koala
   Coast affected by localised extinctions. It is concluded that
   human-influenced mortality and not habitat loss per se, is the greatest
   threat to koala population viability in these rapidly urbanising areas.

Abstract = {{Burning has traditionally been used in the southern French Alps to
   maintain open lands for grazing. In the context of land use abandonment,
   prescribed burning may be the only realistic practical tool available to
   oppose encroachment by woody plants in numerous mountainous landscapes.
   Although only recently developed as a modern tool for wildfire
   prevention and management of pastoral grasslands, this practice is now
   becoming widespread, which raises the issue of its impact on the fauna
   in general, and on endangered species in particular. We studied the
   impact of a prescribed fire on the survival and small-scale movements of
   one of the rarest snakes in Europe, the Orsini's viper Vipera ursinii,
   in order to evaluate its potential threat to population sustainability.
   We evaluated the body condition of snakes and the quality of their
   habitat, more precisely the abundance of grasshoppers as the main food
   resource, and the vegetation cover as shelter. About 3.6 ha of a 8.8 ha
   study site was burnt in autumn 2003. Snake population parameters were
   estimated using multi-state capture-mark-recapture methods. We
   demonstrate that burning reduced the survival of the vipers by more than
   half during the first year following the fire. Contrary to what was
   expected, there was no evidence of emigration from the burned to the
   unburned area immediately after the fire. Despite the decrease in
   grasshopper density and vegetation cover in the burned area, there was
   no evidence of mid-term mortality in snakes that could result from an
   increased predation rate or from the reduced body condition of snakes.
   As such high mortality, mainly or entirely due to the direct effect of
   fire, is likely to have large repercussions on population
   sustainability, we suggest several improvements of prescribed fire
   protocols to minimize their impact and strongly emphasize the need for a
   prescribed fire policy that takes into account specific recommendations
   for threatened species like Orsini's viper. The case of the Orsini's
   viper is very typical of conservation problems in open mountain lands,
   and we believe that our research will help determine the most suitable
   approach for long-term conservation of biodiversity in such semi-natural
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fire-prone woodlands and savannas world-wide face management
   challenges resulting from fire exclusion and subsequent encroachment of
   fire sensitivetrees. In the Pacific Northwest (USA), Quercus garryana
   oak woodlands and savannas are threatened by encroachment from the
   native conifer Pseudotsuga menziesii in the absence of fire.
   2. In the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park (California, USA),
   prescribed fire and conifer removal have been used to restore encroached
   woodlands. We examined the effects of encroachment and restoration on
   understorey vegetation, comparing four treatments: prescribed fire,
   prescribed fire and conifer removal, conifer removal, and encroached
   (control).
   3. Treatments including prescribed fire had the greatest native species
   richness. These two treatments also had the greatest non-native species
   richness, at both the site level and the treatment level. Woodlands
   treated with conifer removal and no prescribed lire were intermediate in
   species richness and diversity compared to burned treatments and
   encroached woodlands. Encroached woodlands had diminished richness and
   diversity compared to all restoration treatments. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination demonstrated that conifer
   basal area, conifer litter and fine wood were associated with low
   species richness and diversity and that elevation and thatch were
   associated with higher species richness and diversity. Indicator species
   analysis identified that most native species and non-native species were
   associated with burned woodlands that were never encroached.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both prescribed
   fire and conifer removal have benefits for understorey plant
   communities, increasing species richness, diversity and cover in oak
   woodlands and shifting understorey communities from forest-associated
   species to more woodland-associated species. Restoration of remnant
   Quercus garryana oak woodlands is complicated by the persistence and
   abundance of non-native herbaceous plants.}},

Abstract = {{Although Australia has a diverse native rodent fauna, the population

   habitat use and population dynamics of the ash-grey mouse (Pseudomys
   albocinereus) through trapping and radio-tracking in Boonanarring Nature
   Reserve, Western Australia. Although there was no relationship between
   capture rate and time since fire, ash-grey mice selected dense
   understorey vegetation. Burrows (47\% of 19 unique daytime locations),
   Xanthorrhoea spp. (26\%), tree hollows (11\%), shrubs (11\%), and logs
   were selected as daytime refuges. Mean (+/- s.e.) short-term home-range
   size was 1.70 +/- 0.97ha (n=9) (maximum=9.15ha). There was some evidence
   that ash-grey mice may be excluded from favourable habitat by a high
   abundance of house mice (Mus musculus). Management to prevent declines
   of ash-grey mice should minimise threats to significant habitat features
   - areas with dense understorey vegetation, soils suitable for burrowing,
   grasstrees, hollow logs, and tree hollows. Suitable management
   strategies include: retention or rehabilitation of remnant vegetation;
   exclusion of livestock; low-intensity, small-area burns; and control of

Abstract = {{Extensive habitat loss and changing agricultural practices have caused
   widespread declines in grassland birds throughout North America. The
   Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma-the largest remaining tallgrass
   prairie-is important for grassland bird conservation despite supporting
   a major cattle industry. In 2004 and 2005, we assessed the community,
   population, and demographic responses of grassland birds to the
   predominant management practices (grazing, burning, and haying) of the
   region, including grasslands restored under the Conservation Reserve
   Program (CRP). We targeted 3 species at the core of this avian
   community: the Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Grasshopper Sparrow
   (Ammodramus savannarum), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Bird
   diversity was higher in native prairie hayfields and grazed pastures
   than CRP fields, which were dominated by Dickcissels. Although
   Dickcissel density was highest in CRP, their nest success was highest
   and nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Moluthrus ater) lowest in
   unburned hayfields (in 2004). Conversely, Grasshopper Sparrow density
   was highest in grazed pastures, but their nest success was lowest in
   these pastures and highest in burned hayfields, where cowbird parasitism
   was also lowest (in 2004). Management did not influence density and nest
   survival of Eastern Meadowlarks, which were uniformly low across the
   region. Nest success was extremely low (5-12\%) for all 3 species in
   2005, perhaps because of a record spring drought. Although the CRP has
   benefited grassland birds in agricultural landscapes, these areas may
   have lower habitat value in the context of native prairie. Hayfields may
   provide beneficial habitat for some grassland birds in the Flint Hills
   because they are mowed later in the breeding season than elsewhere in
   the Midwest. Widespread grazing and annual burning have homogenized
   habitat-and thus grassland-bird responses-across the Flint Hills.
   Diversification of management practices could increase habitat
   heterogeneity and enhance the conservation potential of the Flint Hills
   for grassland birds.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{446-458}},
Abstract = {{The non-native tree, Tamarix spp. has invaded desert riparian ecosystems
   in the south-western United States. Fire hazard has increased, as
   typically fire-resistant native vegetation is replaced by Tamarix. The
   tamarisk leaf beetle, Diorhabda carinulata Desbrochers, introduced for
   biological control, may affect fire behaviour by converting hydrated
   live Tamarix leaves and twigs into desiccated and dead fuels. This
   potentially increases fire hazard in the short term before native
   vegetation can be re-established. This study investigates how fire
   behaviour is altered in Tamarix fuels desiccated by Diorhabda herbivory
   at a Great Basin site, and by herbivory simulated by foliar herbicide at
   a Mojave Desert site. It also evaluates the influence of litter depth on
   fire intensity. Fire behaviour was measured with a fire intensity index
   that integrates temperature and duration (degree-minutes above 70
   degrees C), and with maximum temperature, duration, flame lengths, rates
   of spread and vegetation removal. Maximum temperature, flame length and
   rate of spread were enhanced by foliar desiccation of Tamarix at both
   sites. At only the Mojave site, there was a trend for desiccated trees
   to burn with greater fire intensity. At both sites, fire behaviour
   parameters were influenced to a greater degree by litter depth,
   vegetation density and drier and windier conditions than by foliar
   desiccation.}},

Abstract = {{Our case study evaluated the short-term (11yr) implications of wildfire
   on greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) breeding-season
   habitat (i.e., nesting and brood-rearing) and ground-dwelling arthropod
   abundance on Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge in northwestern Nevada,
   USA. Two different-aged wildfire sites were sampled in mountain big
   sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana) cover types in 1998 and 1999.
   Plant communities in burned and associated unburned areas did not differ
   appreciably in species composition and wildfire did not negatively
   impact arthropod abundance. Wildfires did not increase the frequency of
   exotic plant species, such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), nor did
   wildfire have a detrimental effect on native perennial bunchgrasses.
   Wildfires were effective at changing the mountain big sagebrush
   community structure from shrub-dominated to one dominated by native
   grasses and forbs 2-3yr post-burn. However, the absence of shrub cover
   following 2-3yr of post-fire recovery indicates our overall estimates of
   vegetation structure were not consistent with published guideline
   requirements for managing sage-grouse breeding-season habitat. Although
   burning had little stimulatory effect on total forb cover 10-11yr
   post-burn, the vegetation and structural components needed to maintain
   suitable sage-grouse nesting and brood-rearing habitats were present in
   the burned site. The short-term habitat response to wildfire suggests
   prescribed fire can be a useful tool to achieve management objectives by
   manipulating vegetation structure and composition of shrub-dominated
   landscapes. However, land managers should be cautious using prescribed
   fire as a management tool in big sagebrush ecosystems if the goal is to

   spore number was due to a general increase in most of the 17 fungal

Pages = {{233-243}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is used in fire-prone environments worldwide to
   reduce fuel loads and the severity and spread of future wildfires.
   Forest habitat structures, such as large trees, dead trees and logs are
   highly flammable, yet also are essential for animal species that require
   hollows (cavities) as den sites for shelter and reproduction. We
   examined the effects of experimental prescribed burns on the use of den
   sites by a small marsupial, the yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus
   flavipes, in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, we radio-tracked
   individual A. flavipes to identify forest habitat structures preferred
   as den sites and recorded the fate of known den sites following patchy
   prescribed burns. We found that large living trees and dead trees were
   used as den sites disproportionately to their relative abundance in the
   forest. While all marked individuals of A. flavipes survived the
   immediate impacts of patchy prescribed burns, almost a third (16/52) of
   den sites identified before burning were lost, including 17\% of trees
   (4/23) and 48\% of logs (10/21). The vulnerability of den sites to
   prescribed burns can be attributed to the decay-dependent effect of fire
   on both trees and logs, whereby, the amount of damage from fire is
   related to the structure's pre-fire condition (i.e. whether dead or
   alive, amount of decay). Large trees and large logs are scarce in this
   dry forest ecosystem and their replacement is likely to take a century
   or more due to the slow growth rates of trees. The ecological impacts of
   prescribed burning on habitat structures used by A. flavipes and other
   hollow-using species can be moderated by: (1) carrying out patchy,
   rather than complete burns; (2) ensuring the inter-fire interval is
   sufficient to allow time for replenishment of resources; and (3)
   planning at a regional scale to maintain an appropriate spatial pattern
   of post-fire age-classes, including areas retained as long-unburned
   (e.g. > 50 years) in which resources such as deep litter, large logs and
   dead trees can accumulate.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Once widespread, Australia's bluegrass tussock grasslands (dominated by
   Dichanthium sp.) of the Queensland Central Highlands are now severely
   endangered. Despite being biodiversity rich and highly valued as low
   input, nutrient-dense grazing systems, bluegrass tussock grasslands have
   suffered extensive clearing and degradation over the last 150 years.
   Natural recovery of these grasslands is possible but rates of recovery
   are slow. As such, there is an urgent need to assess practical
   management strategies to accelerate recovery of these grasslands, with a
   particular focus on early-successional stages, when aggressive exotic
   species are most prevalent. To date, no studies have tested whether
   commonly used grassland restoration strategies can enhance
   early-successional stages and accelerate regeneration in this system.
   Here, we examine the early short-term impacts (first two seasons) of two
   common grassland restoration approaches, with two variations each:
   direct seeding (single species and low seed diversity) and vegetation
   clearing (prescribed burning and glyphosate application) across two
   common starting points: a formerly cropped old field and a historically
   overgrazed natural grassland. No treatment increased native diversity
   (Shannon's or richness) in plots but the composition of burned plots in
   the old field did become more similar to healthy reference sites after
   two seasons. Burning combined with direct seeding also increased the
   abundance of the dominant grass, Dichanthium sericeum, toward healthy
   reference levels within the first two seasons post seeding. This study
   provides a practical assessment of the short-term impacts and capacity
   of common grassland restoration treatments to enhance the recovery of
   Australia's tussock grassland systems.}},

Abstract = {{Public lands are often tasked with ecosystem restoration that may
   include fire as a management tool in order to foster the return of
   ecosystem composition, structure, or function to a previous state. In
   some ecosystems, such as woodlands, the role of fire is poorly
   understood because mixed-fire regimes complicate assessment of landscape
   level fire return intervals and successional pathways. Management of
   these public woodlands may be difficult due to the need to accomplish
   multiple objectives such as carbon (C) sequestration and wildlife
   conservation on properties with marginal productivity. To assess the
   role of fire in affecting various ecological processes and offer
   information for future wildland management decision-making, we measured
   C storage, vegetation composition, and habitat suitability for an
   endangered bird species (golden-cheeked warbler, Dendroica chrysoparia)
   in juniper-oak woodlands with documented past surface fires within
   Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. We found significantly
   different total aboveground biomass C with average values of 5.25, 6.86,
   and 9.18 kg m(-2) of C for 60 plots grouped into recent (<40 year), old
   (>= 40 year), and no fire treatments, respectively. Interpretation of
   fire for each plot was based on fire scar data derived from a previous
   tree-ring study for the refuge. We found fire significantly reduced site
   C primarily due to reduced tree density. We also found increased oak
   recruitment associated with fires that occurred in low summer
   precipitation years. Calculated habitat suitability index values for the
   golden-cheeked warbler did not significantly differ between groups.
   However, fire may have a dual effect on habitat suitability. While
   catastrophic wildfire can damage potential habitat and significantly
   reduce regional carbon storage, our study showed that moderate intensity
   fires in dense young juniper stands promotes tree species diversity,
   favorable for future habitat formation. We conclude that fire as a
   management focus, including use of prescribed burning and fuel
   treatments to reduce wildfire risk, may be implemented on a single
   conservation property to achieve multiple expected outcomes. However,
   this requires detailed ecological information regarding woody species
   composition and population structure to help assess legacy conditions
   that influence the interpretation of present woodland conditions and
   future projections given restoration efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Understanding the dynamics of woody tree species distribution in savanna
   systems remains a challenge despite considerable attention the topic has
   received in recent years. Disturbances such as fire and elephant effects
   on woody vegetation are well documented, yet the influence of these
   factors on emerging landscape-scale patterns such as height and species
   distributions continue to be poorly understood. The aim of this study
   was to identify how a suite of environmental variables (rainfall,
   temperature, aspect, slope, geology, fire frequency and elephant
   density) and their relative contributions, may affect woody species
   distribution in relation to structural height classes. Using the Maximum
   Entropy model for three structural height classes of the fifteen most
   frequently occurring woody species in the Kruger National Park (South
   Africa), the environmental variables best explaining each species
   distribution were identified. The three structural classes were defined
   to capture canopy height categories of specific management interest,
   namely Shrub (0.75-2.5 m), Brush (2.5-5.5 m) and Tree (over 5.5 m). The
   weighted contributions of environmental variables for each species and
   its associated size class were further analyzed for similarities using a
   resemblance matrix based on the Bray-Curtis similarity index coupled
   with a hierarchical clustering test. Our main findings suggest that the
   patterns and processes driving woody composition and structure are
   largely decoupled and that the distribution of different structural
   classes of a particular species may not be driven by the same
   environmental variables. Future studies should take cognizance of this
   as ignoring one or the other may lead to confounding results.}},

   was reduced, tortoises started using forested habitat that had become
   overgrown. However, shrub reduction may be temporary, as woody stem
   densities increased postburn. Thus, the one-time use of fire to manage

   forested formations were not as resilient to fire disturbance as typical

   health was defined as an integration of the degree to which vegetation

   comparison of current and future regimes to the ``historical{''} system.
   Departure from the ``historical{''} regime in wildland environments was
   found to be related to altered disturbance patterns, especially changed
   fire regimes, forest insect and disease levels and excessive livestock
   grazing effects. Overall, mid-seral forests are currently more prevalent
   than they were in the past and old forests, especially single-layer
   structural types, are less abundant. Non-native plant species and
   altered plant community composition conditions exist across broad areas
   of rangelands. Landscape health has declined substantially in many

Abstract = {{Historic fire suppression and intensive forest management in longleaf
   pine (Pinus palustris) sandhill forests has resulted in hardwood
   encroachment and degradation of this fire-dependent ecosystem. Active
   management is now required to restore native community structure and
   composition, but little is known about the long-term impacts of typical
   restoration techniques on ecosystem properties. In 1994, the Longleaf
   Pine Restoration Project (LPRP) was established in fire-excluded
   longleaf pine sandhills of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to explore the
   effects of restoration treatments on plant and animal community
   composition and soil processes. Experimental treatments applied included
   three hardwood reduction techniques and delayed burn. Reference sites
   were concurrently monitored. Fifteen years later, we revisited the LPRP
   plots to determine whether soil processes showed lasting treatment
   effects. This study showed that there were no differences in soil C and
   N between the reference and the fire-suppressed plots prior to the
   treatments, suggesting that soil C and N were relatively resistant to
   degradation. This study also showed that the restoration treatments had
   a significant effect by reducing soil C, but this effect was only
   short-lived (<3 years). In addition, a MRPP (multi-response permutation
   procedure) analysis showed that only the herbicide treatment was still
   different from the reference plots 15 years after the initial
   treatments. Thus, this study suggests that repeated fires (or lack of)
   or hardwood removal treatments have little detectable effect on soil
   nutrients in these nutrient-poor ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{According to official statistics, forest and other wooded lands cover
   54.4\% of the Spanish national territory. However, approximately 39.2\%
   of Spanish forest lands are under different types of protection and only
   18.4 million ha (36\% of the country) are true forests or plantations.
   Four main forest ecoregions can be distinguished in Spain:
   Mediterranean, Atlantic, Alpine and Subtropical (Macaronesic). The
   particular characteristics of these eco-regions determine the particular
   types of forest resource utilisation. Three objectives are dominant: (a)
   biodiversity conservation (main objective in the Macaronesic area), (b)
   timber production (important in the Atlantic region) and (c)
   multifunctionality as well as non-timber products (important in the
   Mediterranean and Alpine ecoregions). In the second half of the 20th
   century, the combination of new Permanent Plot Networks (PPN),
   silvicultural trials (covering a wide range of species and site
   conditions), and the National Forest Inventory (NFI), made possible to
   develop new forest models, especially during recent years due to
   advances of statistical software combined with improved field
   observations. New forest models for different tree species, management
   purposes and regions have been developed at different scales, including
   whole stand and individual-tree approaches, and taking into account
   forest diversity and end-user aims. The combination of PPN and NFI
   allows further improvement of the models, including additional output
   functions to estimate tree and stand variables related to specific
   objectives (e.g. crown fire risk). The advantages and disadvantages of
   Forest Observational Studies (FOS) and National Forest Inventory data
   for developing forest models are discussed. Finally, an example of
   synergy between FOS and NFI observations for developing dynamic growth
   models for intensively managed forest in the Atlantic ecoregion is
   presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A three year monitoring program evaluated the effects of a December 1997
   wildfire in southwest Alberta, on Foothills Rough Fescue grassland
   species composition, ground cover, herbage production, and forage
   quality. Changes in species abundance included a reduction in grass
   cover (p<0.10) after burning. Rough Fescue also increased seedhead
   production during the second year after fire (p = 0.08). Relative to the
   unburned area, grarninoid production declined (p < 0.05) by
   approximately 40\% with burning, while forb production was unaffected.
   By the second growing season, live plant cover and herbage production
   had recovered on the burned area. The forage quality of individual
   Foothills Rough Fescue plants was greater on the burned area, with the
   greatest increase in crude protein in 1998 (p < 0.10), and energy and
   total digestibility in 1999 (p < 0.05). Increased quality may be linked
   to the level of forage production, as well as a fire-induced delay in
   plant phenology. Although soil erosion appeared to be minimal, there was
   an increase in exposed soil and a corresponding decline in litter and
   mulch cover (p < 0.05). Greater nitrogen levels (p = 0.05 1) were found
   in creeks downstream of the burn area during 1998, indicating some
   nutrient losses may be attributed to the fire. Although the grasslands
   examined displayed considerable resilience to this severe wildfire,
   favourable recovery was probably linked to the high precipitation during
   1998, when summer rainfall was 48\% above average.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the effects of disturbance on soil seed bank spatial
   structure, variation in seed bank species composition was analyzed at
   two spatial scales in mature (undisturbed) and recently disturbed stands
   of Interior Douglas-fir forest in south-central British Columbia.
   Coarse-scale analysis among stands 10-100 km apart using Multi-Response
   Permutation Procedures showed that individual mature stands were mainly
   characterized by unique seed bank species compositions. Disturbance had
   an homogenizing effect on seed bank species composition at the coarse
   scale-there was less variability among stands following disturbance by
   both low and high severity fires, and by non-salvage logging. In
   contrast, finer scale analysis among sampling units c. 10 m apart showed
   that heterogeneity in seed bank species composition was greater on
   severely burned and logged sites, commensurate with greater levels of
   soil disturbance, than on lightly burned and undisturbed sites. Despite
   the high intensity of seed bank sampling (sixty 25 cm(2) soil samples

   infrequent species were removed from the dataset. The number of seed

Abstract = {{We compared the bird and woody plant communities of 2 to 24-year-old
   rehabilitation areas at Gove bauxite mine (20 km2) in the seasonal
   tropics of northern Australia, where Alcan has maintained a consistent
   rehabilitation program since it began operation in 1974. Birds were
   censused every second month over 2 years in 30 widely separated 0.25-ha
   plots, representing five chronosequence stages. These were also compared
   with six ({''}off-mine{''}) plots adjacent to the mine, which
   represented the annually burnt open forest typical of the region.
   Short-lived Acacias dominated the early chronosequence stages, whereas
   eucalypts dominated in later stages. Mean avian species richness and
   abundance increased significantly along the chronosequence, with values
   for the oldest rehabilitation plots being very similar to those for the
   off-mine plots. However, analyses of similarity revealed that the bird
   communities of the oldest rehabilitation plots were distinct from those
   of the off-mine plots, indicating that succession in rehabilitation
   areas is not following a direct trajectory toward the native open forest
   surrounding the mine. Several hollow-nesting bird species were scarce or
   absent in the rehabilitation areas, probably reflecting the absence of
   older hollow-bearing trees. Many differences between the rehabilitation
   and the off-mine areas in vegetation structure, woody flora, and
   avifauna appear to be related to the exclusion of fire from the

   the effects of fire on the biota but caution against the use of fires

Title = {{The effect of prescribed fire on Biscogniauxia infection and delta C-13
   in an upland oak-pine forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{451}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Incidents of Quercus decline have been driven by complicated
   interactions among factors, such as temperature, drought, pathogenic
   fungi, insect pests, and stand structure, which operate at multiple time
   scales. Past incidents of elevated tree mortality during drought in the
   upland forests of Oklahoma were associated with biotic factors;
   specifically, the infection of Quercus species by canker-causing fungi
   in the genus Biscogniauxia. Biscogniauxia canker and dieback have been
   previously associated with water stress but little is known about the
   interactions between forest densification, prescribed fire, water
   stress, and canker incidence. We investigated the effects of prescribed
   fire and reduced basal area on Biscogniauxia canker incidence in Quercus
   species at the Pushmataha Wildlife Management Area (PWMA) in
   southeastern Oklahoma. The PWMA is an ongoing forest management
   experiment established in 1984 with stands maintained to the present day
   with prescribed fire return intervals of 34 + yr, 4-yr, and 1-yr.
   Through field surveys we found that the incidence of Biscogniauxia
   canker was lowest among units with a fire return interval of 1-4 years
   (p < 0.002). Additionally, greater canopy dieback was associated with
   greater frequency of stem cankers. Management of these forests reduces
   basal area, alters water stress, and may reduce pathogen incidence due
   to both greater host resilience and reduction of sporulation sources. To
   evaluate associations among these factors, we assessed Biscogniauxia
   canker incidence and leaf stable C isotope composition (delta C-13) an
   indicator of stomatal closure from drought stress-from Quercus
   marilandica (blackjack oak) and Quercus stellata (post oak) trees in
   units experiencing 34 + yr, 4-yr, and 1-yr fire return intervals. We
   found that leaf delta C-13 was highest in units experiencing 4-yr and
   1-yr fire return intervals, indicating that these trees more frequently
   had closed stomata, counter to our expectation that the reduced basal
   area associated with frequent fire would decrease delta C-13 due to
   decreased water stress. Instead, our results suggest that trees in units
   experiencing reduced basal area encounter additional stressors (e.g.,
   wind, vapor pressure deficit, and high soil evaporation) that lead to
   stomatal closure. Additionally, higher delta C-13 in units receiving
   prescribed fire applications may be a response to frequent disturbance
   via direct effects of fire on tree water relations. Further
   investigation is needed to understand the interactions of fire regimes
   with water stress in these ecosystems. Although, we did not find a clear
   link to tree water status, basal area reduction decreased the incidence
   of Biscogniauxia canker, demonstrating that prescribed fire can be used
   to promote forest health.}},

Abstract = {{Aspen is considered a keystone species, and aspen communities are

   of aspen stand health across the Eagle Lake Ranger District (ELRD),
   Lassen National Forest, California, U.S.A., indicate that 77\% of stands
   are in decline and at risk of loss as defined by almost complete loss of
   mature aspen with little or no regeneration. This decline is due to
   competition from conifers establishing within aspen stands as a result
   of modification of natural fire regimes coupled with excessive browsing
   by livestock. Restoration treatments were implemented in four aspen
   stands in 1999 using mechanical equipment to remove competing conifers
   to enhance the growth environment for aspen. Recruitment and
   establishment of aspen stems were measured in treated stands (removal of
   competing conifers) and non-treated stands (control) immediately prior
   to treatment and 2 and 4 years post-treatment. There was a significant
   increase in total aspen stem density and in two of three aspen
   regeneration size classes for treated stands compared to controls.
   Pre-treatment total aspen density was positively associated with total

Abstract = {{Managers of natural areas often employ controlled disturbances as a tool
   to manage plant and animal populations. This approach assumes that
   disturbances are responsible for the structure of biological communities
   and that appropriate application of the disturbance will ensure the
   persistence of native plants and animals. If species in a community do
   not respond predictably to variation in disturbance regime, then
   management strategies based on emulating disturbance may fail to ensure
   the persistence of all species. In this study, we examined the efficacy
   of using prescribed fire as a tool for managing populations of breeding
   and wintering birds in the pine rocklands of southern Florida. We found
   that variation in fire history had little effect on vegetation structure
   and no effect on bird abundance. Instead, vegetation structure was more
   closely associated with water-table elevation and soil type, whereas
   most of the observed variation in the structure of bird assemblages
   appeared to be a function of degree of urbanization in the landscape.
   That the structure and composition of bird assemblages was independent
   of variation in fire history suggests that manipulating the fire regime,
   at least within the range of variability observed in this study, is
   unlikely to prove effective as a means to manage bird populations. In
   general, our results argue for caution in assuming that a single process
   can be used to control the structure of biological communities,

Abstract = {{Reforestation schemes, which encompass environmental plantings and
   natural regeneration of vegetation on cleared land, are increasingly
   being established for the purposes of mitigating anthropogenic carbon
   emissions. However, these schemes are themselves at risk from climate
   change and associated changes in disturbance regimes. Simultaneously,
   there is increasing pressure on reforested areas to achieve multiple
   co-benefits, e.g. maximizing carbon storage, ameliorating environmental
   degradation and promoting biodiversity objectives, all while not
   adversely affecting community values, such as agricultural production.
   Here, we review the myriad of biophysical risks posed by climate change
   to reforested areas while documenting management actions and policies
   that can enhance both the resistance and resilience of reforested areas
   to such risks. While it is difficult to buffer vegetation against the
   direct effects of climate change, such as elevated temperature and
   changed precipitation patterns, it is possible to manage some of the
   indirect effects, such as wildfire, drought and insect defoliation.
   Methods for reducing the vulnerability of reforested areas range from
   site-specific management actions, particularly around design and
   location, through to regional and national scale initiatives, such as
   vulnerability assessments and decision support tools. The complexity of
   objectives and risks posed to reforested areas means that it is vitally
   important to evaluate outcomes from across the current estate of
   reforested areas. However, there is currently no national protocol in
   place in Australia to track, monitor or evaluate the outcomes of
   reforestation. Thus, we recommend the establishment of a national
   framework for analyzing and supporting the growing range of
   reforestation activities.}},

Abstract = {{Management of many North American forests is challenged by the need to
   balance the potentially competing objectives of reducing risks posed by
   high-severity wildfires and protecting threatened species. In the Sierra
   Nevada, California, concern about high-severity fires has increased in
   recent decades but uncertainty exists over the effects of fuel-reduction
   treatments on species associated with older forests, such as the
   California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis). Here, we
   assessed the effects of forest conditions, fuel reductions, and wildfire
   on a declining population of Spotted Owls in the central Sierra Nevada
   using 20 years of demographic data collected at 74 Spotted Owl
   territories. Adult survival and territory colonization probabilities
   were relatively high, while territory extinction probability was
   relatively low, especially in territories that had relatively large
   amounts of high canopy cover (70\%) forest. Reproduction was negatively
   associated with the area of medium-intensity timber harvests
   characteristic of proposed fuel treatments. Our results also suggested
   that the amount of edge between older forests and shrub/sapling
   vegetation and increased habitat heterogeneity may positively influence
   demographic rates of Spotted Owls. Finally, high-severity fire
   negatively influenced the probability of territory colonization. Despite
   correlations between owl demographic rates and several habitat
   variables, life stage simulation (sensitivity) analyses indicated that
   the amount of forest with high canopy cover was the primary driver of
   population growth and equilibrium occupancy at the scale of individual
   territories. Greater than 90\% of medium-intensity harvests converted
   high-canopy-cover forests into lower-canopy-cover vegetation classes,
   suggesting that landscape-scale fuel treatments in such stands could
   have short-term negative impacts on populations of California Spotted
   Owls. Moreover, high-canopy-cover forests declined by an average of
   7.4\% across territories during our study, suggesting that habitat loss
   could have contributed to declines in abundance and territory occupancy.
   We recommend that managers consider the existing amount and spatial
   distribution of high-canopy forest before implementing fuel treatments
   within an owl territory, and that treatments be accompanied by a
   rigorous monitoring program.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{451}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Seedbanks are essential for forest resilience, and disturbance
   interactions could potentially modify seedbank availability, subsequent
   forest regeneration patterns, and successional trajectories. Regional
   mountain pine beetle outbreaks have altered forest structure and
   seedbanks in fire prone-landscapes across western North America and
   could influence forest regeneration. We examined the drivers of
   lodgepole pine recruitment across a gradient of fire severity from fire
   that burned through gray-phase outbreak conditions in central interior
   British Columbia, Canada. We considered ten potential drivers of
   lodgepole pine recruitment including: fire severity, mountain pine
   beetle outbreak severity, cone abundance, branch retention, open cones,
   exposed soil, snag fall, snow accumulation, climate moisture deficit,
   and frost events, as well as the contribution of unburned fire refugia
   to lodgepole pine recruitment. In 2016, we inventoried 83 plots that
   spanned gradients of outbreak severity, burning conditions, and fire
   severity across three fires that burned through lodgepole pine dominated
   forests with gray-phase conditions that had moderate to high mortality.
   We used generalized linear models to evaluate drivers of variability in
   seedling recruitment. Our analyses affirm that wildfire is a critical
   mechanism for lodgepole pine seedling recruitment. For plots that burned
   as crown and surface fire, recruitment densities were two or six times
   greater compared plots that experienced light surface or were fire
   refugia, respectively. Recruitment was driven by cone abundance
   indicating the importance of an available seed source. In fire refugia,
   recruitment was three times greater during the post-outbreak period
   compared to before outbreaks, suggesting cone senescence from mortality
   and/or xeriscent-cueing of cones. The unevenness in recruitment across
   gradients of outbreak and fire severity contribute to the heterogeneity
   of stand initiation across these landscapes that may be important for
   mediation of subsequent outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Restoration of habitats may be used as a conservation tool when
   ecosystems have lost their natural structure, dynamics or functioning
   over large areas. Controlled and planned use of fire could be an
   effective way to restore habitats of many threatened species in boreal
   forests where fire suppression has been effective. We asked whether the
   large-scale landscape context affects the occurrence of rare and
   threatened species in forest habitats that have been burned to restore
   their fire-related structures.
   Location Boreal forests in southern Finland.
   Methods We designed a large-scale field experiment that included nine
   Pinus sylvestris forests (5-10 ha each) in southern Finland. Sites were
   located in two regions: (1) in eastern region with shorter management
   history and (2) in western region where intensive forestry has continued
   longer. We evaluated whether restoration of dead/burned wood is
   beneficial for rare and conservation-dependent species and measured the
   recovery of pyrophilous and red-listed insects (beetles and flatbugs) in
   burned forests, using standardized sampling effort. Altogether, 956
   individuals of 29 red-listed and pyrophilous species were sampled.
   Results Rare species colonized areas quickly, but there was a clear
   difference in species richness between the regions. The eastern forests
   harboured higher species richness after restoration. In these sites, the
   average species richness was 13.7 species per site, whereas in western
   forests it was 5.0 species per site. Similar pattern was also observed
   in subgroups: the corresponding numbers for pyrophilous species were 9.7
   vs. 3.8, for red-listed 8.7 vs. 2.3 and for red-listed pyrophiles 4.7
   vs. 1.2.
   Main conclusions Introducing fire back to boreal forests can aid in the
   recovery of rare species, but the landscape context considerably affects
   the success of restoring species. If restored habitats are located in
   landscapes that have lost their natural properties long ago, the success
   of restoration seems to be more challenging than in landscapes where
   habitats have been modified more recently.}},

Abstract = {{Fire influences the distribution of fauna in terrestrial biomes
   throughout the world. Use of fire to achieve a mosaic of vegetation in
   different stages of succession after burning (i.e., patch-mosaic
   burning) is a dominant conservation practice in many regions. Despite
   this, knowledge of how the spatial attributes of vegetation mosaics
   created by fire affect fauna is extremely scarce, and it is unclear what
   kind of mosaic land managers should aim to achieve. We selected 28
   landscapes (each 12.6 km2) that varied in the spatial extent and
   diversity of vegetation succession after fire in a 104,000 km2 area in
   the semiarid region of southeastern Australia. We surveyed for reptiles
   at 280 sites nested within the 28 landscapes. The landscape-level
   occurrence of 9 of the 22 species modeled was associated with the
   spatial extent of vegetation age classes created by fire. Biogeographic
   context and the extent of a vegetation type influenced 7 and 4 species,
   respectively. No species were associated with the diversity of
   vegetation ages within a landscape. Negative relations between reptile
   occurrence and both extent of recently burned vegetation (10 years
   postfire, n = 6) and long unburned vegetation (>35 years postfire, n =
   4) suggested that a coarse-grained mosaic of areas (e.g. >1000 ha) of
   midsuccessional vegetation (1135 years postfire) may support the
   fire-sensitive reptile species we modeled. This age class coincides with
   a peak in spinifex cover, a keystone structure for reptiles in semiarid
   and arid Australia. Maintaining over the long term a coarse-grained
   mosaic of large areas of midsuccessional vegetation in mallee ecosystems
   will need to be balanced against the short-term negative effects of
   large fires on many reptile species and a documented preference by
   species from other taxonomic groups, particularly birds, for older
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the utility of combining metapopulation models with
   landscape-level forest-dynamics models to assess the sustainability of
   forest management practices. We used the Brown Creeper (Certhia
   americana) in the boreal forests of northern Ontario as a case study. We
   selected the Brown Creeper as a potential indicator of sustainability
   because it is relatively common in the region but is dependent on snags
   and old trees for nesting and foraging; hence, it may be sensitive to
   timber harvesting. For the modeling we used RAMAS Landscape, a software
   package that integrates RAMAS GIS, population-modeling software, and
   LANDIS, forest-dynamics modeling software. Predictions about the future
   floristic composition and structure of the landscape tinder a variety of
   management and natural disturbance scenarios were derived using LANDIS.
   We modeled eight alternative forest management scenarios, ranging in
   intensity from no timber harvesting and a natural fire regime to
   intensive timber harvesting with salvage logging after fire. We
   predicted the response of The Brown Creeper metapopulation over a
   160-year period and used future population size and expected minimum
   population size to compare the sustainability of the various management
   scenarios. The modeling methods were easy to apply and model predictions
   were sensitive to the differences among management scenarios, indicating
   that these methods may be useful for assessing and ranking the
   sustainability of forest management options. Primary concerns about the
   method are the practical difficulties associated with incorporating fire
   stochasticity in prediction uncertainty and the number of model
   assumptions that must be made and tested with sensitivity analysis. We
   wrote new software to bell) quantify the contribution of landscape
   stochasticity to model prediction uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{We examined differences in bird communities in relation to

   structure was dramatically changed by postfire silvicultural practices.
   Number of stand trees, shrubs, seedlings, snags, and vegetation coverage

   gleaners, and timber drillers were significantly higher in the unburned

Abstract = {{Soil microstructures and biological activity were studied in thin
   sections of Calluna heathland soils subject to periodic burning. Freely
   drained Brown Podzolic soils from a species-rich heath at Dinner Muir,
   Aberdeenshire, Scotland were compared with shallow Humo-ferric Podzols
   with a thick humus layer (5-10 cm) supporting a species-poor heath at
   Balmenach, Aberdeenshire.
   Structures with greater porosity occurred in all Dinner soils and the
   most recently burned Balmenach soil. Burning led to an increase in soil
   porosity which gradually disappeared after a period of 2-3 years. Soils
   of the recently burned site had more enchytraeid worms than those burned
   ten years previously. Most of the Dinner soil samples were dominated by
   extremely fine granular structure which could have been produced by
   flocculation of well decomposed organic matter or by enchytraeid worms.
   In recently burned sites the increase in soil macro - and microbial
   activities may lead to the formation of composite structures.
   Regular burning every 10-15 years has been the land management practice
   in Scottish heathlands to ensure the production of fresh browse of
   nutritious heather shoots for herbivores. The near-ground microclimate
   and regeneration mechanisms of heathland plants are well adjusted to the
   periodic disturbance by fire. We found that the gradual decrease in
   surface soil porosity over time can be restored by prescribed burning.

Abstract = {{Patches of fire-sensitive vegetation often occur within fire-prone
   tropical savannas, and are indicative of localized areas where fire
   regimes are less severe. These may act as important fire refugia for
   fire-sensitive biota. The fire-sensitive tree Callitris intratropica
   occurs in small patches throughout the fire-prone northern Australian
   savannas, and is widely seen as an indicator of low-severity fire
   regimes and of good ecosystem health. Here, we address the question: to
   what extent do Callitris patches act as refuges for other fire-sensitive
   biota, and therefore play a broader conservation role? We contrast
   floral and faunal species composition between Callitris patches and
   surrounding eucalypt savanna, using three case studies. In the first
   case study, a floristic analysis of 47 Callitris patches across Western
   Australia's Kimberley region showed that woody species in these patches
   were overwhelmingly widespread, fire-tolerant savanna taxa. No species
   of special conservation concern occurred disproportionately within
   Callitris patches. Similarly, there was no concentration of
   fire-sensitive fauna or flora in five Callitris patches in the East
   Kimberley. Finally, there was no difference in ant species composition
   among 12 Callitris patches and surrounding eucalypt savannas in Kakadu
   National Park, Northern Territory, and there were no fire-sensitive ant
   species in Callitris patches. Our three case studies from throughout the
   northwestern Australia provide no evidence that Callitris patches act as
   important refuges for fire-sensitive flora or fauna within fire-prone
   eucalypt savannas. This calls into question the notion that Callitris is
   a strong indicator of general ecosystem health.}},

Abstract = {{Soil collected from 38 sites on Kangaroo Island in South Australia,

   introduced species germinated across all sites. Fifty-three of the
   native plant species that germinated were absent in the above-ground
   vegetation, including twelve rare or threatened species, and three
   species previously unrecorded from Kangaroo Island. Fourteen native
   species and six introduced species germinated in heat plus smoke treated
   soil but not in untreated soil from the same sites. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling ordination indicated differences in native
   species composition between sites with a long history of sustained
   livestock grazing ({''}grazed{''} sites) and largely ungrazed sites
   ({''}ungrazed{''} sites). On average, significantly more native species
   germinated from treated soil sampled from ``ungrazed{''} sites than were
   found in the standing vegetation, while for ``grazed{''} sites this
   difference was not significant. This indicates the greater potential for
   post-fire regeneration of native vegetation from the soil seed bank of
   ungrazed sites than from that of long grazed sites. Both ``ungrazed{''}
   and ``grazed{''} sites contained weeds in their soil seed banks,

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In the western United States, fire has become a significant concern in
   the management of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) ecosystems.
   This is due to large-scale increases in cover of the fire-prone invasive
   annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) and, concurrently, concerns about
   declining quantity and quality of habitat for Greater Sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus). The prevailing paradigm is that fire
   results in a loss of sage-grouse habitat on timescales relevant to
   conservation planning (i.e., 1-20 yr), since sagebrush cover can take
   many more years to recover post-fire. However, fire can have effects
   that improve sage-grouse habitat, including stimulating perennial grass
   and forb production. The conditions under which fire results in the
   permanent loss or enhancement of sage-grouse habitat are not well
   understood. We used long-term data from the Utah Division of Wildlife
   Resources Range Trend Project to assess short-term (1-4 yr
   post-treatment) and long-term (6-10 yr post-treatment) effects of fire
   on vegetation cover at 16 sites relative to sage-grouse habitat
   vegetation guidelines. Sagebrush cover remained low post-fire at sites
   considered historically unsuitable for sage-grouse (<10\% initial
   sagebrush cover). In contrast, at sites that had higher (>10\%) pre-fire
   sagebrush cover, sagebrush cover decreased to <10\% in the
   short-termpost-fire, but by 6-10 yr after fire, most of these sites
   exhibited a recovering trajectory and two sites had recovered to >10\%
   cover. Post-fire sagebrush cover was positively related to elevation.
   Across all sites, perennial grasses and forbs increased in cover to
   approximately meet the habitat vegetation guidelines for sage-grouse.
   Cheatgrass cover did not change in response to fire, and increased
   perennial grass cover appears to have played an important role in
   suppressing cheatgrass. Our results indicate that, while fire poses a
   potential risk for sage-grouse habitat loss and degradation, burned
   sites do not necessarily need to be considered permanently altered,
   especially if they are located at higher elevation, have high sagebrush
   cover pre-fire, and are reseededwith perennial grasses and forbs
   post-fire. However, our results confirm that fire at more degraded
   sites, for example, those with <10\% sagebrush cover, can result in
   cheat-grass-dominated landscapes and sagebrush loss at these sites
   should be avoided.}},

   All the juvenile individuals with diameters that were less than 5 cm

   Three structural parameters were calculated: density, frequency and
   relative abundance. The juvenile flora included 82 species, and
   Combretaceae, Mimosaceae, Rubiaceae and Caesalpiniaceae were die most
   important families. This dominance was observed in the woody layer and
   showed Lis the close linkage between juvenile and adult strata. The
   effects of disturbance factors, like fire and competitors (grasses),
   strongly limits juvenile growth demography from the low stratum to the
   higher stratum: 15\% of species present in the juvenile stratum were
   only dominant in this stratum but not in the adult one. The pattern of
   size class distribution of juveniles indicates that some of the most
   dominant species could be rare in the future structure of woody plant
   communities if the disturbance factors are maintained. This trend can be
   stopped with an adequate management practice of early prescribed fires.}},

   ecological effects. These issues are well illustrated by the political
   and scientific debate about the capacity of cattle grazing to reduce
   fire hazard in the Victorian Alps of Australia; there have been
   remarkably few scientific studies to illuminate this issue. Here we use
   remote sensing and geographic information system analysis to determine
   the effect of active grazing licences on fire severity (crown scorch) in
   eucalypt forests and woodlands following large fires in the Alps during
   the summers of 2002/2003 and 2006/2007. Our statistical analyses, which
   controlled for spatial autocorrelation, found crown scorch was strongly
   related to vegetation type but there was no evidence that cattle grazing
   reduced fire severity. There was some evidence that grazing could
   increase fire severity by possibly changing fuel arrays. Such landscape
   analyses are a critical approach given that large-scale grazingxfire
   trials are prohibitively expensive and impractical to conduct.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of information on species abundance in the Neotropic is
   insufficient, and this prevents the execution of precise analysis and
   the definition of adequate conservation strategies for endemic and
   threatened species. This study aimed to analyze the population size of
   the endemic and threatened subspecies Grus canadensis nesiotes. For
   this, a simultaneous census was undertaken in 24 count stations in Isla
   de la Juventud (IJ) and 32 stations in Ciego de Avila (CA), Cuba, during
   two consecutive days between 2008 and 2010. Abundance and behavior
   pattern (instantaneous method) were analyzed by habitat type, to help
   understand how cranes modify their behavioral pattern when the natural
   habitat is changed. Flocks in IJ had three individuals, and between 1.9
   +/- 1.5 and 2.8 +/- 1.5 in CA. Population size in IJ was 164
   individuals, and in CA of 137, 141 and 168 individuals for the 2008-2010
   period, respectively. The counting efficacy was high (IJ: 91 \%; CA:
   81-87 \%) and the numerical concordance was intermediate (IJ: 45.4 \%;
   CA: 72 \%). When comparing the habitat type, the abundance was higher in
   natural savannahs (83), followed by coastal flats (59), pines (23) and
   cattle pastures (7) in IJ; while in CA, marsh grasslands hosted the
   greatest abundance for the three years period (130; 120; 112), followed
   by grassland with palms (2; 17; 51) and cattle pastures (5; 4; 5). The
   cranes were fed more in cattle pastures and were more alert in natural
   savannas and marsh grasslands. The frequency of feeding and alert
   behaviors was different from the natural savannah/coastal flats and
   natural savannah/cattle pastures combinations in IJ. For CA, differences
   were found between marsh grasslands and marsh grasslands with palms. The
   population size increased by management strategies adopted in CA;
   nevertheless, might be affected by habitat loss associated with invasive
   alien plants in IJ. We propose the maintenance of prescribed fire in
   marsh grasslands under protection regime, as a strategy for long-term
   management to contribute with population growth.}},

Abstract = {{Fire management in protected areas requires an understanding of the
   consequences of fire regimes. Invertebrates are a key component of
   biological communities, but studies of fire impacts on diverse
   invertebrate assemblages over long timeframes are rare. The responses of
   ground- and foliage-active invertebrate assemblages to fire in
   buttongrass moorlands were investigated using a space-for-time design.
   Assemblages in recently burnt moorlands were distinct from those in
   older moorlands. Contrary to expectations, ground-active invertebrate
   abundance, but not taxon richness, was greatest in young regrowth (2-3
   years since last fire), owing to large populations of Formicidae,
   Orthoptera, Collembola and Diptera. Foliage-active invertebrate
   assemblages followed the expected trend with least numbers of
   invertebrates and taxa in young regrowth. Very few taxa (n = 9) were
   absent from young successional stages and none were absent from later
   successional stages. Invertebrate assemblages in moorlands on low
   productivity soils took approximately twice as long to return to their
   pre-fire state than assemblages on moderate productivity soils. The
   shifts in invertebrate composition were associated with shifts in
   vegetation composition. Vegetation density was found to be a potentially
   important predictor of invertebrate compositional variation. Fire in
   buttongrass moorland appears to have a limited impact on ground-active
   and foliage-active invertebrate assemblages, suggesting that these
   components of the invertebrate fauna are resilient to fire (i.e. able to
   return to the pre-fire state). Given that fire impedes successional
   processes that convert moorlands into rainforest, and eliminate many of
   the moorland invertebrate species, conservation management of moorlands
   should involve the acceptance or imposition of fire.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroduction of fire and grazing, alone or in combination, has
   increasingly been recognized as central to the restoration of North
   American mixed-grass and tallgrass prairies. Although ecological studies
   of these systems are abundant, they have generally been observational,
   or if experimental, have focused on plant species diversity. Species
   diversity measures alone are not sufficient to inform management, which
   often has goals associated with life form groups and individual species.
   We examined the effects of prescribed fire, light cattle grazing, and a
   combination of fire and grazing on three vegetation components: species
   diversity, groups of species categorized by life form, and individual
   species. We evaluated how successful these three treatments were in
   achieving specific management goals for prairies in the Iowa Loess Hills
   (U.S.A.). The grazing treatment promoted the greatest overall species
   richness, whereas grazing and burning and grazing treatments resulted in
   the lowest cover by woody species. Burning alone best achieved the
   management goals of increasing the cover and diversity of native species
   and reducing exotic forb and (predominantly exotic) cool-season grass
   cover. Species-specific responses to treatments appeared idiosyncratic
   (i.e., within each treatment there existed a set of species attaining
   their highest frequency) and nearly half of uncommon species were
   present in only one treatment. Because all management goals were not
   achieved by any one treatment, we conclude that management in this
   region may need refining. We suggest that a mosaic of burning and
   grazing (alone and in combination) may provide the greatest
   landscape-level species richness; however, this strategy would also
   likely promote the persistence of exotic species. Our results support
   the need to consider multiple measures, including species-specific
   responses, when planning and evaluating management.}},

Abstract = {{Patch burning can be a potential management tool to create grassland

   burned patches], and unburned patches {[}control]) on vegetative cover,
   water erosion, and soil properties on a patch-burn experiment
   established in 2011 on a Yutan silty clay loam near Mead, NE. The

   burned patches was 2.8 times (19.6 +/- 4.1 vs. 7.1 +/- 3.0 mm {[}mean

Abstract = {{Loss of suitable habitat has historically been the primary threat to
   Wenatchee Mountains checker-mallow (Sidalcea oregana var. calva), a
   narrow endemic of Chelan County, Washington. The largest population of
   this federally listed endangered species is now protected from loss by
   Natural Area Preserve status, yet the survival of the plant is still in
   jeopardy. Possible threats to population growth and persistence include
   seed predation by weevils, succession in meadow habitats due to fire
   suppression, and loss of pollinator populations. This two-year
   exploratory study examined these threats in an effort to determine their
   relative impacts on the species and to guide future study. Macrorhoptus
   sidalceae, a Sidalcea specialist insect was identified as a primary seed
   predator. Seed predation by this weevil was severe; only 17\% of seeds
   examined escaped weevil predation across all study sites. Few
   significant differences were found in prescribed burn experiments
   designed to determine effects of fire on checker-mallow individuals and
   on the surrounding herbaceous community. This may indicate that the
   species is not detrimentally affected by fire, and that prescribed fire
   may be a valuable management tool for habitat conservation. A second
   Sidalcea specialist insect, the bee Diadasia nigrifrons, was observed to
   be a consistent flower visitor and possibly important pollinator of the
   checker-mallow. These results have implications for future study and
   management of both the checker-mallow and other endangered species,
   because it is common for an imperiled species to be threatened by
   numerous impacts that must all be considered simultaneously for

Abstract = {{To cope with the post-fire challenges of decreased availability of food

   recovery. We simultaneously quantified torpor and activity patterns for
   female antechinus from three adjacent areas: (i) the area of a
   management burn 1 year post-fire, (ii) an area that was burned 2 years
   prior, and (iii) a control area. In comparison to shortly after the
   management burn, antechinus in all three groups displayed less frequent

Abstract = {{Fire-stimulated or pyrogenic flowering is one of many traits that enable
   plants in fire-prone ecosystems to persist or dominate following
   frequent fires. Obligate pyrogenic flowering has long been observed in
   wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana), a foundation bunchgrass in frequently
   burned longleaf pine ecosystems in the southeastern United States.
   Widespread fire exclusion in this ecosystem has contributed to
   well-documented declines in plant and animal biodiversity prompting the
   need for restoration efforts. We studied the effect of fire
   reintroduction on the flowering of wiregrass in northern Florida, USA.
   Prescribed fires were ignited in a 50-yr unburned site and an adjacent
   frequently burned site in the summer of 2017. Wiregrass was measured
   eight months after the burns in both stands. As expected, the frequently
   burned stand had higher density, basal area, and percent flowering of
   wiregrass tussocks. Logistic regression revealed that wiregrass
   initiated flowering at significantly larger sizes in the long-unburned
   stand. Despite these differences, wiregrass size distributions were
   similar in both stands, with the long-unburned stand lacking tussocks in
   the largest (100+ cm(2)) size class. We did not find differences in the
   number of flower culms per unit of mass between the two stands. Even
   though diminished in nearly every measure, the ability of wiregrass to
   flower after five decades of fire exclusion, and presumably no sexual
   reproduction, provides evidence of resilience of the dominant herb of
   these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The restoration of natural fire regimes has emerged as a primary
   management objective within fire-prone forests in the interior western
   US. However, this objective becomes contentious when perceived to be in
   conflict with the conservation of rare wildlife species. For example,
   the integration of fire ecology in disturbance-prone forests of eastern
   Washington with the recovery of the Northern spotted owl has been
   described as a management dilemma. We intersected modeled spotted owl
   habitat with mapped priority fuels treatment areas in order to determine
   the magnitude of the potential conflict between fuels management and owl
   conservation. Our results show that there is considerable overlap within
   dry forests between high suitability spotted owl habitat and
   moderate-high priority fuels treatment areas (34\% overlap). However,
   there is also considerable overlap of lower suitability spotted owl
   habitat with moderate-high priority fuels treatment areas (35\% overlap)
   providing opportunities to accomplish multiple management objectives if
   one considers a landscape perspective. We propose that a conservation
   strategy for the Northern spotted owl in the eastern Cascades consider
   the following: emphasize landscape restoration of dry forests within
   which spotted owl habitat is embedded; landscapes considered for
   restoration need to be large enough to accomodate the effects of fire
   disturbances and still retain sufficient habitat to support spotted owl
   populations; and include adaptive management allowing for adequate
   monitoring and feedback for managers to make needed adjustments.

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-90}},
Abstract = {{Fungi are essential components of all ecosystems in roles including
   symbiotic partners, decomposers and nutrient cyclers and as a source of
   food for vertebrates and invertebrates. Fire changes the environment in
   which fungi live by affecting soil structure, nutrient availability,
   organic and inorganic substrates and other biotic components with which
   fungi interact, particularly mycophagous animals. We review the
   literature on fire and fungi in Australia, collating studies that
   include sites with different time since fire or different fire regimes.
   The studies used a variety of methods for survey and identification of
   fungi and focussed on different groups of fungi, with an emphasis on
   fruit-bodies of epigeal macrofungi and a lack of studies on microfungi
   in soil or plant tissues. There was a lack of replication of fire
   treatment effects in some studies. Nevertheless, most studies reported
   some consequence of fire on the fungal community. Studies on fire and
   fungi were concentrated in eucalypt forest in south-west and
   south-eastern Australia, and were lacking for ecosystems such as
   grasslands and tropical savannahs. The effects of fire on fungi are
   highly variable and depend on factors such as soil and vegetation type
   and variation in fire intensity and history, including the length of
   time between fires. There is a post-fire flush of fruit-bodies of
   pyrophilous macrofungi, but there are also fungi that prefer long
   unburnt vegetation. The few studies that tested the effect of fire
   regimes in relation to the intervals between burns did not yield
   consistent results. The functional roles of fungi in ecosystems and the
   interactions of fire with these functions are explained and discussed.
   Responses of fungi to fire are reviewed for each fungal trophic group,
   and also in relation to interactions between fungi and vertebrates and
   invertebrates. Recommendations are made to include monitoring of fungi
   in large-scale fire management research programs and to integrate the
   use of morphological and molecular methods of identification.
   Preliminary results suggest that fire mosaics promote heterogeneity in
   the fungal community. Management of substrates could assist in
   preserving fungal diversity in the absence of specific information on
   fungi.}},

Abstract = {{The application of fire is prescribed for management of habitats for
   many plant and animal communities, but its effects on herpetofauna are
   diverse and remain poorly understood. To date no studies have examined
   the effects of prescribed fire on endangered San Francisco gartersnake
   (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia) populations, despite a call for
   prescribed fire in the recovery plan for the species. We used
   multi-state capture-mark-recapture models to assess whether effects of
   prescribed fire were ephemeral, occurring only during the year of the
   fire, or persisted for 3 years following the fire, and to estimate the
   effects of prescribed fire on demographic parameters of San Francisco
   gartersnakes inhabiting California coastal prairie. Ephemeral fire
   effects were better supported for transitions (movement) between burned
   and unburned areas, but persistent fire effects were better supported
   for apparent survival and recapture probabilities. Movement between
   burned and unburned areas decreased during the year of the fire, but
   transition rates from burned to unburned areas decreased less than
   transition rates from unburned to burned areas in the year of the fire.
   Apparent survival probabilities increased in the unburned areas
   following the fire but were largely unchanged, though more uncertain, in
   burned areas following the fire. Recapture probabilities decreased
   site-wide following the fire, though the decrease was greater in burned
   areas than in unburned areas. Although imprecise, our estimates of the
   effects of prescribed fire suggest that under the conditions of this
   fire (low-intensity fall burn applied to a small area within a robust
   population and followed by wet weather), prescribed fire is a viable
   management tool for maintaining open habitats where San Francisco
   gartersnakes occur. (c) 2018 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in
   forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced

   necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected

   synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated
   experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of
   DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected
   forests. We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW
   manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We
   included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the
   site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning.
   Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects,
   ground insects, wood-inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and
   cavity-nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were
   used in meta-analyses. Although meta-analysis outcomes were

   insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in
   general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or
   cavity-nesting birds. Although reviewed studies were mainly short term,
   our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the
   potential to increase the abundance of DW-dependent species and, in most
   cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive
   effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other
   interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller
   enrichment of DW amounts. Policy implications. The findings of the
   review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part
   of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas.
   The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important,
   a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an
   effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity-nesting
   birds, snag losses need to be minimized.}},

   repeated applications of fuel reduction methods}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera) are important components of forest
   ecosystems and can be affected by fuel reduction forest management
   practices. We assessed the impact of repeated applications of fuel
   reduction treatments on abundance and diversity of ants within upland
   mixed-hardwood forests in the Southern Appalachian Mountains in North
   Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (similar to 56 ha
   each) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments, which
   included prescribed burning (B), mechanical felling (M), a combination
   of prescribed burning and mechanical felling (MB), and a control (C;
   i.e., no treatment). We implemented treatments multiple times (two
   mechanical thinnings and four prescribed burns) over the course of a
   15-yr period. Due to tree mortality and resultant canopy gaps from
   high-severity burns, forest structure was dramatically altered in MB.
   Over a 3-yr period (2014-2016), we captured 54,219 ants comprised of 23
   genera using pitfall and colored pan traps. Prenolepis imparis was the
   most common ant species collected, and it was significantly lower in
   abundance in MB than all other treatments. However, the non-native
   species Brachyponera chinensis was more abundant in MB than all other
   treatments. Thus, some fuel reduction treatments may have consequences
   for invasive ant colonization in forests. Most ant taxa did not differ
   in abundance among treatments, suggesting that some fuel reduction
   practices may affect some, but not all ant species. Our results indicate
   that some fuel reduction treatments can alter forest ant communities,
   thus contributing to changing forest ecosystem dynamics. Monitoring of
   ants and other bioindicators after repeated rounds of fuel reduction
   treatments could provide useful knowledge that can be used to help
   balance forest management and biological diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The study compared plant and avian diversity and species composition
   between four habitats to review the potential implications of two
   distinct management practices on a forestry estate, namely to
   rehabilitate riparian zones to grasslands or woodlands as the two
   habitats that historically occurred on the property. The study habitats
   were Plantation (Pinus trees in riparian zone), Bushland (recently
   harvested), Grassland (cleared of broadleaf plants), and Woodland
   (control). At seven sampling sites per habitat, a vegetation assessment
   was conducted, while birds were caught with mist nests. Plant species
   richness increased from Plantation to Woodland, whereas most bird
   species and individuals were found in Bushland. Plant and bird species
   composition differed significantly between habitats. Bushland and
   Grassland birds were closely associated with exotic forbs. Grassland
   attracted birds with diverse habitat and nesting-site associations, and
   Woodland birds associated with woody plants. It is recommended that the
   majority of riparian zones be managed as grasslands, although the exact
   affect of the biennial summer burning and presence of exotic plants on
   birds needs to be investigated. To attract cavity-nesting birds to the
   Estate, some suitable riparian zones should be rehabilitated to Woodland
   by planting Ficus and Acacia trees, as these trees are the most abundant
   and frequently occurring in this habitat. Rather than manage avian
   diversity per se, the African stonechat in Grassland and lesser
   honeyguide in Woodland can be employed as indicators of the
   rehabilitation state of the riparian zones.}},

Volume = {{150}},

Abstract = {{The Corsican Nuthatch Sitta whiteheadi is a bird endemic to Corsica
   Island and has a very small population. Its habitat, Corsican pine Pinus
   nigra laricio forest, is currently restricted to less than 16,000 ha and
   is threatened by forest fires. In this article, we aim (1) to evaluate
   the effects of a large wildfire on a Nuthatch population, and (2) to
   identify the habitat features that influence the presence/absence of the
   Nuthatch after fire, so as to promote appropriate forestry practices
   after fire. The study has been conducted on a study plot of 300 ha which
   is part of a larger area severely burnt in August 2003. Habitat
   characteristics have been investigated on 39 plots of 1,225 m(2)
   occupied by the bird, and 22 randomly chosen plots without the Nuthatch.
   We observed a decrease of 37.5\% in Nuthatch abundance the first spring
   after the fire, but the impact showed great local variation as a
   function of fire severity. Logistic modelling showed that the presence
   of Nuthatch mainly depended on the degree of crown alteration: the
   Nuthatch tended to be present when at least one pine had less than 2.5 m
   of crown burned. We have no evidence of any direct fire-induced
   mortality, but several effects of fire can explain this population
   decrease, namely, the reduction of canopy volume, the decrease of the
   amount of pine seeds, and the reduction of nest-site availability. These
   results permit us to propose a simple criterion that can help in
   choosing the plots to be cut where salvage logging is necessary.}},

Title = {{Incorporating disturbance into trophic ecology: Fire history shapes
   mesopredator suppression by an apex predator}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1594-1603}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Apex predators can suppress smaller bodied ``mesopredators.{''} In
   doing so, they can provide refuge to species preyed upon by
   mesopredators, which is particularly important in regions where
   mesopredators are invasive. While most studies of mesopredator
   suppression focus on the response of mesopredators to human control of
   apex predators, other factors-including natural and anthropogenic
   disturbance-also drive the occurrence of apex predators and, in doing
   so, might shape spatial patterns of mesopredator suppression.
   2. We examined the role of fire in shaping the occurrence of an apex
   predator and, by extension, mesopredators and small mammals in a
   fire-prone region of semiarid Australia. We measured the activity of an
   apex predator (the dingo Canis dingo); an invasive mesopredator it is
   known to suppress (the red fox Vulpes vulpes); and two species of native
   small mammal (Mitchell's hopping mouse Notomys mitchelli; silky mouse
   Pseudomys apodemoides) that are potential prey, across 21 fire mosaics
   (each 12.56 km(2)). We used piecewise structural equation modelling and
   scenario analysis to explore the interactions between fire, predators
   and prey.
   3. We found that dingoes were affected by fire history at the landscape
   scale, showing a preference for recently burned areas. While foxes were
   not directly affected by fire history, a negative association between
   dingoes and foxes meant that fire had an indirect impact on foxes,
   mediated through dingoes. Despite the suppression of foxes by dingoes,
   we did not observe a trophic cascade as small mammals were not
   negatively associated with foxes or positively associated with dingoes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Disturbance regimes have the capacity to
   shape patterns of mesopredator suppression when they alter the
   distributions of apex predators. Environmental change that promotes
   native predators can therefore help suppress mesopredators-a common
   conservation objective in regions with invasive mesopredators. The
   indirect consequences of disturbance regimes should be considered when
   managing disturbance (e.g. fire) for biodiversity conservation.}},

Title = {{Rapid and transient changes during 20 years of restoration management in
   savanna-woodland-prairie habitats threatened by woody plant encroachment}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Open-structured habitats, such as heathlands, grasslands, and savannas,
   support unique plant diversity but are threatened by woody plant
   encroachment in diverse locations globally. During 20 years of
   vegetation management aimed at restoring and sustaining oak savannas,
   woodlands, and wet prairies in a Midwestern USA oak savanna region, we
   examined change in 17 plant community metrics ranging from cover of rare
   species to pollinator floral resources. Metrics indicative of
   open-habitat quality increased rapidly but also declined rapidly with
   time since disturbance spanning a first decade of intensive management
   (tree cutting and 4-5 fires/decade) and a second decade of
   less-intensive management (> 4 years between fires). After initial
   restoration treatments reduced overstory tree density, changes in cover
   of open-habitat specialist species correlated with fluctuations of a
   brushy layer of small trees 1-10 cm in stem diameter. Between 2002 and
   2018, 92\% of sites where small trees increased by over 100/ha had
   declines in open-habitat species, whereas 72\% of sites not experiencing
   that level of woody encroachment had sustained or increasing
   open-habitat species. Conserving open habitats in contemporary
   environments likely requires perpetually frequent low-severity
   disturbance (at least every 3-4 years), periodic severe disturbance
   (e.g., growing-season fires), or multiple treatment types (e.g., managed
   herbivory and fire) to synergistically limit woody encroachment.
   Fluctuations between positive and negative trends in the 20-year dataset
   also highlight that perhaps restoration success should not be evaluated
   on the basis of a net change from beginning to end, but rather on a
   time-weighted accrual of restoration benefits.}},

   limited capacity to explain population changes without comparable

Abstract = {{Patch-burning is frequently advocated as a management tool to enhance
   the biodiversity and pasture values of spinifex (Triodia) grasslands. In
   the northern Simpson Desert, Queensland, pastoralists use fire to reduce
   the likelihood of broad-scale wildfires and improve pastures for cattle.
   I conducted a before - after - control - impact experiment to
   investigate the response of small mammals to the short-term (< 1 year)
   effects of patch-burning between August 1999 and June 2001. The
   experiment was replicated at three locations subject to differing
   rainfalls, with two 1-ha study grids remaining unburnt as controls, and
   two being burnt at each location. The areas burnt ranged from 1 to 3 ha.
   Dasycercus cristicauda and Pseudomys desertor responded negatively to
   the fire treatment. Notomys alexis responded positively to the fire
   treatment in the final trapping session but only at one location.
   Factors indicative of temporal and spatial variation in rainfall, time
   and site had a greater effect on the abundance of small mammals than the
   fire treatment. Heavy rainfalls in 2000 increased seed production and
   prompted increases in the populations of rodent species and Dasycercus
   cristicauda. The greatest numbers of captures were made at the sites
   that received the highest rainfalls. Patch-burning regimes are likely to
   increase the resilience of `fire-sensitive' species dependent on dense
   spinifex by reducing the extent of wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Growth-stage optimization (GSO) offers a new approach to biodiversity
   conservation in fire-prone regions by estimating the optimal
   distribution of vegetation growth stages that maximize a species
   diversity index. This optimal growth-stage structure provides managers
   an operational goal explicitly linked to a positive conservation outcome
   but does not define the fire regime needed to achieve it. We paired GSO
   with LANDIS II, a landscape succession and disturbance simulation model,
   to (a) estimate the optimal growth-stage structure that maximized
   vegetation diversity in a south-east Australian heathy woodland, (b)
   define the fire regime needed to achieve it, and (c) determine the
   cumulative effects of different fire-regime scenarios on vegetation
   diversity over a 60-year period. Scenarios included 0\%, 2\%, 5\%, and
   10\% of the landscape burnt per year by prescribed fire only, or in
   combination with three alternative wildfire regimes. Furthermore, we
   investigated the differences in the optimal growth-stage structure
   relating to above-ground, soil seedbank, and total (above and soil
   seedbank) diversity datasets. The growth-stage structure that maximized
   total vegetation diversity comprised approximately even proportions of
   all stages. In contrast, separately analysed above-ground and soil
   seedbank data resulted in a greater proportion of younger and older
   growth-stages, respectively. Scenarios including 5\% prescribed burning
   per year (with and without wildfire) resulted in diversity values within
   1.5\% of the theoretical maximum value. Scenarios including 2\% and 10\%
   prescribed fire resulted in diversity values 8\%-12\% and 1.5\%-5\%
   lower than the maximum, respectively. Scenarios without prescribed fire
   caused diversity to fall 30\%-70\%. Trends across the 60 years showed
   that wildfire depressed diversity and subsequent prescribed fire drove
   recovery within 15 years. The largest threat to vegetation diversity was
   the absence of fire. Synthesis and applications. Combining growth-stage
   optimization and simulation modelling is a powerful way of defining a
   conservation-based fire management goal and identifying the prescribed
   fire regime needed to achieve it. We demonstrated that vegetation
   diversity in heathy woodland was increased by prescribed fire, with and
   without the cumulative effect of wildfire, and declined sharply when
   fire was excluded. Our method provides a flexible platform for
   developing long-term fire management strategies that seek to balance
   human safety and biodiversity conservation. Including both plants and
   animals in GSO will help land managers meet the needs of multiple taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of genetic structure and patterns of connectivity is valuable

   many species can be separated by vast distances, and despite an apparent
   lack of current geographical barriers to dispersal, habitat
   specialisation, which is exhibited by many desert species, may limit
   connectivity throughout this expansive region. We characterised the
   genetic structure and differentiation of the great desert skink
   (Liopholis kintorei), which has a patchy, but widespread distribution in
   the western region of the Australian arid zone. As a species of cultural
   importance to local Aboriginal groups and nationally listed as

   a fire rotation of less than or equal to3 years is necessary to maintain
   suitable breeding habitat for Florida grasshopper sparrows but does not

Abstract = {{Questions: How do species composition and abundance of soil seed bank
   and standing vegetation vary over the course of a post-fire succession
   in northern heathlands? What is the role of seed banks-do they act as a
   refuge for early successional species or call they simply be seen as a
   spillover from the extant local vegetation?
   Location: Coastal Calluna heathlands, Western Norway.
   Methods: We analysed vegetation and seed bank along a 24-year post-fire
   chronosequence. Patterns ill community composition, similarity and
   abundances were tested using multivariate analyses, Sorensen's index of
   similarity, vegetation cover and seedling counts.
   Results: The total diversity of vegetation and seed bank were 60 and 54
   vascular plant taxa, respectively, with 39 shared species, resulting in
   68\% similarity overall. Over 24 years, the heathland community
   progressed from open newly burned ground via species rich graminoid- and
   herb-dominated vegetation to mature Calluna heath. Post-fire Succession
   was not reflected in the seed bank. The 10 most abundant species
   constituted 98\% of the germinated seeds. The most abundant were Calluna
   vulgaris (49\%; 12018 seeds m(-2)) and Erica tetralix (34\%; 8414 seeds
   m(-2)). Calluna showed significantly higher germination the first 2
   years following fire.
   Conclusions: Vegetation species richness, ranging from 23 to 46 species
   yr(-1), showed a unimodal pattern over the post-fire succession. In
   contrast, the seed bank species richness, ranging from 21 to 31 species
   yr(-1) showed no trend. This suggests that the seed bank act as a
   refuge; providing a constant source of recruits for species that
   colonise newly burned areas. The traditional management regime has not
   depleted or destroyed the seed banks and continued management is needed
   to ensure sustainability of northern heathlands.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is an integral component of forest ecosystems. Therefore,
   contemporary changes to the frequency and severity of disturbances in
   forests may have lasting ecological consequences. In recent decades,
   widespread mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks
   have contributed more to total tree mortality than other disturbances
   such as wildfire. Past studies have used a broad range of measurements
   to evaluate the local effects of beetle outbreaks on birds (e.g., dead
   trees per acre versus percent mortality) and this has led to some
   challenges and inconsistencies in generalizing results across larger
   spatial scales. We sought to address these inconsistencies by using a
   single data source estimating outbreak-related tree mortality across the
   western United States to better understand the effect of beetle
   outbreaks on avian communities in lodgepole pine forests. This study
   uses five years of avian monitoring data (2008-2012) from the Integrated
   Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions program, collected across
   Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. We developed a hierarchical
   multispecies occupancy model to quantify changes in the forest bird
   community following beetle outbreaks while accounting for the imperfect
   detection of species. Mean species richness (N) did not differ between
   MPB outbreak sites (N = 19.35, 95\%CRI = 17.00, 22.01) and sites with no
   outbreak (N = 20.23, 95\%CRI = 16.83, 24.25). Furthermore, we found weak
   evidence for a community-level response to increasing outbreak severity
   and time since outbreak, due in part to the variability among species
   within each of the four nesting guilds analyzed in this study (canopy,
   cavity, shrub, and ground nesting birds). However, we did find evidence
   of turnover in community composition with just over 50\% of species (28
   of 55) having statistically different occurrence rates following MPB
   outbreaks. Our study underscores the notion that species richness alone
   does not fully express changes in the forest bird community. Our results
   also suggest many species, particularly cavity nesters, utilize
   beetle-killed forests and persist at higher occurrence rates for up to
   10 years post-outbreak. This period includes the timeframe when
   beetle-killed trees are most readily salvageable and emphasizes the need
   for continued evaluation of snag-retention policies prior to the
   implementation of post-outbreak management activities.}},

Abstract = {{Qualea grandiflora Mart. (Vochysiaceae) is one of the most widespread
   species within the cerrado formation, which counts amongst the most
   threatened ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the regeneration ecology
   of Q. grandiflora is a central requirement for the success of
   conservation measures and silvicultural management strategies.
   Exhaustive investigation was carried out into each of the development
   stages, and the connected processes within the regeneration cycle, to
   provide a better understanding of the main factors influencing the
   regeneration ecology and the recruitment dynamics of the species. For
   this purpose, we analysed 92 different sources of information in this
   review, divided into two groups (n = 41 with ``basic species
   information{''} and n = 51 with ``specific information about
   regeneration stages and processes{''}) relevant for regeneration and
   silviculture. Our literature review showed the high proportion of
   studies addressing the processes flowering, pollination and fruiting,
   whereas the subsequent processes like seed dispersal, seed storage,
   germination and seedling development are almost entirely lacking. This
   also applies for spatial information about environmental conditions and
   the related regeneration processes in Q. grandiflora. This knowledge is
   important for management, for example, knowledge of the critical
   distances between flowering and seed producing trees to ensure
   genetically diverse regeneration and the identification of safe sites
   for seedling establishment. Most of the practical suggestions in
   relation to increasing densities or growth of Q. grandiflora seedlings
   and saplings made in the literature are linked to less intensive fire
   management strategies adopted at certain times. The use of selective
   herbivory to reduce the increasing competition pressure exerted by
   invasive grasses and hampering Q. grandiflora seedlings is also cited.
   In this study we highlight the need for more complex species-specific
   information following the development stages and processes of the
   regeneration cycle so as to prepare a continuous strategy with a range
   of management approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of recent fires on the native ant
   communities in two habitats of north-west Patagonia that differ in
   vegetation structural complexity. Using bait traps, we sampled ants in
   replicated scrub and steppe areas including paired burned and unburned
   sites. Fires significantly reduced plant cover and ant diversity only in
   scrub sites. The drop in diversity was due to (a) a reduction in the
   abundance of rare species associated with woody vegetation, and (b) an
   increase in the abundance of the dominant species, which thrive in more
   xeric microclimatic conditions. Consequently, ant assemblage structure
   of burned scrub approaches that of steppe sites. Our findings suggest
   that the effects of disturbances on ant assemblages depends both on
   habitat characteristics, which in turn determine the extent of the
   changes induced by the disturbance, and on the regional context of the
   ant fauna, which in turn determines the ability of the ants to deal with

Abstract = {{The effect of 23 years of low intensity prescribed burning on soil and
   litter invertebrates was studied over 18 months. Samples were collected
   from 40 plots distributed among annually burned, periodically burned
   (every 3-4 yrs), and unburned areas of an oak woodland. A total of
   26,416 invertebrates representing 21 classes and orders were extracted
   from soil core and litter layer samples using Berlese-Tullgren funnels.
   Invertebrates were 25 times more abundant in litter than soil, and Acari
   and Collembola were the most prevalent taxa, accounting for 76\% and
   17\%, respectively, of the total collection. Statistical analyses of the
   Shannon entropy index for diversity and associated values of class and
   order richness, evenness, and abundance indicated that burning was not
   associated with significant changes in the broad invertebrate community.
   Average Shannon entropy indices (H) ranged from 0.73 to 0.78 across burn
   treatments for soil samples and from 0.43 to 0.46 for litter samples.
   However, within Acari, diversity indices were significantly lower (P <
   0.0005) in annually burned plots (H = 0.72) versus unburned controls (H
   = 0.85), and periodic burn plots had an intermediate H value of 0.79.
   Taxa evenness was similar in all treatments (J = 0.40-0.57), reflecting
   the widespread distribution of Acari and Collembola and rare occurrence
   of several orders from which 20 or fewer individuals were collected.
   Fall sample dates had more diverse (soil and litter) and abundant (soil)
   invertebrate assemblages than the spring date (P = 0.001), reflecting
   large seasonal shifts in Acari. The average depth of the litter layer
   was similar, at 2.8-3.1 cm, in all three burn treatments, and was most
   varied in unburned plots. Collectively, the findings suggest that long
   term burning of the woodland for the purpose of vegetation management
   has not altered significantly the broadly classified invertebrate
   community. Possible influences of postfire recovery interval, low fire
   intensity, and remnant litter refugia are considered.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{B181-B197}},
Abstract = {{Heathlands are dynamic ecosystems that change in response to fire
   regimes and climate variations, as well as endogenous processes such as
   competition between component species. An understanding of how
   heathlands change through time is central to the development of
   management strategies that aim to conserve them and maintain coexistence
   of their plants and animals. We briefly review the development of this
   understanding for Sydney's coastal heathlands from the emergence of the
   first published work in the 1930s. In our previous work, we focussed on
   fire regimes and interspecific competition between plants as important
   processes that drive ecosystem dynamics (succession) and mediate species
   coexistence and diversity. Here, we synthesise our understanding of
   heathland dynamics into a state and transition framework. We first
   develop a simple classification of heathland states based on their
   composition of plant functional types and developmental stage with time
   since fire. We then propose a qualitative model that predicts
   transitions between states conditional upon intervals between fires,,
   fire-mediated life cycle processes of component plant species and
   interactions between species. We applied the model to predict
   qualitative changes in heathland state under contrasting fire regime
   scenarios, and tested example predictions using a long-term study of
   heathland dynamics in Royal National Park. Empirical observations of
   overstorey and understorey change were generally consistent with model
   predictions, subject to variability between sites. Importantly, the
   model helps to identify fire scenarios that promote dynamic coexistence
   of multiple heathland states that each support different components of
   heathland biota. We conclude that simple process models can be very
   useful for informing management decisions by describing expected
   responses to alternative management strategies. These predictions lend
   themselves to testing in adaptive management experiments that seek to
   spread risks and improve understanding of ecosystem dynamics for future
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning maintains marsh habitat, but its impact on breeding
   King Rails (Rallus elegans) is poorly understood. This practice may
   serve as a means to enhance populations of a species whose numbers are
   declining in the southeastern United States. We used call-broadcast
   surveys and nest searches to categorize the state of occupied plots by
   the presence or non-presence of nesting activity in the Back Bay region,
   North Carolina and Virginia, in 2010. We also used nest video
   surveillance to estimate nest survival in 2009 and 2010. The
   probabilities that a surveyed plot was occupied (psi(1)) and contained
   an active nest (psi(2)) were higher in recently burned marsh plots (0-1
   year-since-burn {[}YSB]) than in plots with 2 YSB at Mackay Island and
   Back Bay National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs). Highest probabilities were
   recorded in 0-1 YSB plots at Mackay Island NWR (psi 1 = 0.96 0.04, psi 2
   = 0.75 0.18), and the lowest in 2 YSB plots at Back Bay NWR (psi 1 =
   0.21 +/- 0.10, psi 2 = 0.03 +/- 0.04). Nest survival from egg laying to
   hatching (31 d) was 0.48 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.06-0.83),
   with an estimated 0.79 (95\% CI = 0.29-0.96) survival rate for the
   incubation stage (21 d). These nest survival estimates for King Rails in
   fire-managed marshes were similar to estimates for other populations.
   Measures of vegetation cover, proxies for concealment, did not differ
   between nest sites and unused sites, even within recently burned
   marshes. This lack of differences in vegetation structure suggests that
   regrowth occurs rapidly during the period between burning (winter
   months) and the onset of reproduction (late April). Thus, recently
   burned marshes may benefit nesting King Rails by providing nest
   concealment. In addition, burned marshes may enhance availability of
   many invertebrates. Although we found that the probability that surveyed
   plots contained active nests was higher in recently burned marsh plots,
   estimates of fledging success are needed before marsh burns can be
   considered an effective means of fostering population growth.}},

Abstract = {{The longleaf pine-grassland (Pinus palustris-Poaceae) ecosystem occupied
   over 30 million ha in the southeastern United States at the time of
   European discovery. Frequent low- to moderate-intensity surface fires
   ignited by both lightning and native Americans sustained open diverse
   stands in a fire climax and prevented succession to mixed hardwood
   forests. Disruption of prehistorical and historical fire regimes,
   coupled with land conversion, urbanization, and other factors, is
   responsible for the rapid decline of the ecosystem. Today only about 1.2
   million ha remain, much in isolated fragments. Primarily because of
   habitat loss, many animal and plant species associated with longleaf
   forests are now rare or in decline. Restoration ecologists and managers
   face a daunting challenge-recreating an ecosystem, in the face of
   chronic cumulative stress from human activities, that varied widely over
   temporal and spatial scales. Key restoration factors include: (1)
   development of a general understanding of the historical condition of
   the longleaf ecosystem, especially unusual or unique communities and
   habitats embedded in the general fabric of the larger ecosystem, (2)
   initiation and expansion of a fire regime, where feasible, similar to
   that which historically shaped the ecosystem, (3)
   maintenance/enhancement of herbaceous diversity, (4) continued research
   on habitat requirements and distribution of rare species, and (5)
   encouragement of a multi-owner partnership approach to promote
   conservation across the landscape. Landowners and the public must be
   educated about the values of the longleaf pine-grassland ecosystem and
   develop a conservation ethic that considers aesthetics, wildlife, and
   biodiversity, in addition to economics, if the ecosystem is to be
   restored. Most forestry practices used to manage and restore longleaf
   forests are of low short-term risk to rare species in this ecosystem.

Abstract = {{Repeated perturbations, both biotic and abiotic, can lead to fundamental
   changes in the nature of ecosystems, including changes in state.
   Sagebrush steppe communities provide important habitat for wildlife and
   grazing for livestock. Fire is an integral part of these systems, but
   there is concern that increased ignition frequencies and invasive
   species are fundamentally altering them. Despite these issues, the
   majority of studies of fire effects in systems dominated by Artemisia
   tridentata wyomingensis have focused on the effects of single burns. The
   Arid Lands Ecology Reserve (ALE), in south-central Washington (USA), was
   one of the largest contiguous areas of sagebrush steppe habitat in the
   state until large wildfires burned the majority of it in 2000 and 2007.
   We analyzed data from permanent vegetation transects established in 1996
   and resampled in 2002 and 2009. Our objective was to describe how the
   fires, and subsequent postfire restoration efforts, affected
   communities' successional pathways. Plant communities differed in
   response to repeated fire and restoration; these differences could
   largely be ascribed to the functional traits of the dominant species.
   Lowelevation communities, previously dominated by obligate seeders,
   moved furthest from their initial composition and were dominated by
   weedy, early-successional species in 2009. Higher-elevation sites with
   resprouting shrubs, native bunchgrasses, and few invasive species were
   generally more resilient to the effects of repeated disturbances. Shrub
   cover has been almost entirely removed from ALE, although there was some
   recovery where communities were dominated by resprouters. Bromus
   tectorum dominance was reduced by herbicide application in areas where
   it was previously abundant, but it increased significantly in untreated
   areas. Several resprouting species, notably Phlox longifolia and Poa
   secunda, expanded remarkably following competitive release from shrub
   canopies and/or abundant B. tectorum. Our results suggest that community
   dynamics can be understood through a state and transition model with two
   axes (shrub/grass and native/invasive abundance), although such models
   also need to account for differences in plant functional traits and
   disturbance regimes. We use our results to develop a conceptual model
   that will be validated with further research.}},

   Tenure groups include two managed by Aboriginal owners, two national
   parks, a cluster of pastoral leases, and a military training area. This
   information is of relevance to the debate about the role of indigenous
   lands in the Australian conservation estate. The timing and frequency of
   fire was determined by satellite imagery; the biomass and composition of
   the herb-layer and the abundance of large feral herbivores by field
   surveys; and weediness by analysis of a Herbarium database. European
   tenures varied greatly in fire frequencies but were consistently burnt
   earlier in the dry season than the two Aboriginal tenures, the latter
   having intermediate fire frequencies. Weeds were more frequent in the
   European tenures, whilst feral animals were most abundant in the
   Aboriginal tenures. This variation strongly implies a signature of
   current management and/or recent environmental history. We identify
   indices suitable for monitoring of management outcomes in an extensive
   and sparsely populated landscape. Aboriginal land offers a unique
   opportunity for the conservation of biodiversity through the maintenance
   of traditional fire regimes. However, without financial support,
   traditional practices may prove unsustainable both economically and

Abstract = {{The Mallee Emu-wren (Stipiturus mallee) is a threatened, narrow-range
   passerine endemic to south-eastern Australia. To inform future
   conservation measures for this poorly known species, we used ecological
   niche factor analysis, habitat suitability modelling and distance
   sampling to determir e landscape-scale habitat requirements and estimate
   the population size. Using GIS software, we integrated digital layers of
   ecogeographic variables with; (1) presence-only observations to derive
   and validate a habitat suitability model using ecological niche factor
   analysis, and (2) distance sampling to determine population distribution
   and densities across vegetation types. We detected populations in only
   five of seven reserves which they had occupied in 2000. We estimate the
   global population size to be 16,821 individuals (range 8431-39, 104),
   68\% greater than the previously estimated 10,000 individuals, with a
   single large reserve containing the majority (similar to 92\%) of the
   global population. The Mallee Ernu-wren is a habitat specialist,
   primarily occurring in mallee-Triodia vegetation that has not been burnt
   for at least 15 years. The highest densities were in vegetation
   associations containing at least a 15\% cover of Triodia, however, time
   since the habitat was last burnt was the overriding factor in
   determining densities. Large-scale wildfires are a pervasive threat: to
   the global status of the Mallee Emu-wren, and the risk to remaining
   populations is exacerbated by the adverse impact of prolonged drought
   and the potential for altered fire regimes caused by global warming.
   Evaluation of the global population status, and the continued wildfire
   threat warranted recent reclassification of the Mallee Emu-wren from
   Vulnerable to Endangered according to IUCN Red List categories and
   criteria. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past century, fire has been widely suppressed in the western
   Great Plains, in part because of the potential negative effects on
   forage production for livestock. More recently, interest in the use of
   prescribed fire in shortgrass steppe has increased because of the
   potential applications for wildlife management, control of unpalatable
   plant species, and restoration of historic disturbance regimes. We
   studied the effects of prescribed burns conducted during late winter oil
   herbaceous production, forage nitrogen content, and plant species
   composition of shortgrass steppe on the Pawnee National Grassland in
   northeastern Colorado. Late-winter burns conducted in moderately grazed
   sites under a wide range of precipitation conditions during 1997-2001
   did not negatively affect herbaceous production in either the first or
   the second postburn growing season. Burning followed by a severe drought
   in 2002 reduced production by 19\% in the second postburn growing season
   of 2003. Burns temporarily suppressed the abundance of broom snakeweed
   (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and prickly pear cactus (Opuntia polyacantha)
   and enhanced forage nitrogen content during May and June of the first
   postburn growing season. These findings suggest that, except following
   severe drought, prescribed burns conducted during late winter in grazed
   shortgrass steppe for objectives unrelated to livestock production can
   also have neutral or positive consequences for livestock.}},

Abstract = {{An important goal of restoring fire to upland oak-dominated communities
   that have experienced fire exclusion is restoring groundcover plant
   species diversity and composition indicative of fire-maintained
   habitats. Several studies have shown that fire alone, however, may not
   be sufficient to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, treatment-driven
   declines in rare forest specialists could negate the benefits of
   ecological restoration in these ecosystems. I present the results of an
   experiment examining effects of tornado-generated canopy openings and
   biennial spring burning on groundcover vegetation at an oak-pine forest
   in north Mississippi, USA. Results from four years of monitoring showed
   that species richness and abundance of species indicative of
   fire-maintained open habitats were greater at sites with canopy damage
   than at sites with undamaged canopies, especially in years without
   drought. Annual ruderals increased initially following canopy damage but
   then decreased. Few forest indicator species changed in abundance, and
   the few that did increased. Canopy openings appeared to have a greater
   effect than fire on groundcover vegetation, although some legumes and
   panicgrasses appeared to benefit directly from fire. Results suggest
   that fire restoration treatments must include both canopy openings and
   fire to effectively increase the diversity and distinctiveness of
   groundcover vegetation in mixed oak-pine forests. Prescribed burning
   after years of fire exclusion, by itself, does not constitute effective
   restoration of fire (at least in the short term), but it also does not
   appear to reduce the abundance of rare, forest-specialist groundcover
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker
   nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi
   and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus
   pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately
   linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence
   or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities,
   but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the
   fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns
   evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and
   microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees,
   wood-pecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of
   the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal
   invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth
   history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to
   sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest
   age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management
   activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be
   related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related
   to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.}},

   long-term landscape patterns of forests, fire. and defoliator outbreaks.
   Historical descriptions suggest that old growth ponderosa pine forests

   Dendrochronology indicated that defoliating insect outbreaks occurred at
   fairly regular intervals from 1750 to 1900. In the 20(th) century,
   outbreaks have occurred more frequently. We hypothesize that fire
   control and heavy logging of pine since about 1910 have altered tree
   species distribution resulting in more-favored habitat for defoliating
   insects. Recent outbreaks have occurred over larger areas and cause more
   tree mortality. Recent forest fires in these outbreak areas rapidly
   developed into conflagrations. Defoliator/fire episodes are becoming

Abstract = {{Environmental disturbance is predicted to play a key role in the
   evolution of animal social behaviour. This is because disturbance
   affects key factors underlying social systems, such as demography,
   resource availability and genetic structure. However, because natural
   disturbances are unpredictable there is little information on their
   effects on social behaviour in wild populations. Here, we investigated
   how a major wildfire affected cooperation (sharing of hollow trees) by a
   hollow-dependent marsupial. We based two alternative social predictions
   on the impacts of fire on population density, genetic structure and
   resources. We predicted an adaptive social response from previous work
   showing that kin selection in den-sharing develops as competition for
   den resources increases. Thus, kin selection should occur in burnt areas
   because the fire caused loss of the majority of hollow-bearing trees,
   but no detectable mortality. Alternatively, fire may have a disruptive
   social effect, whereby postfire home range-shifts neutralize fine-scale
   genetic structure, thereby removing opportunities for kin selection
   between neighbours. Both predictions occurred: the disruptive social
   effect in burnt habitat and the adaptive social response in adjacent
   unburnt habitat. The latter followed a massive demographic influx to
   unburnt refuge habitat that increased competition for dens, leading to a
   density-related kin selection response. Our results show remarkable
   short-term plasticity of animal social behaviour and demonstrate how the
   social effects of disturbance extend into undisturbed habitat owing to
   landscape-scale demographic shifts. We predicted long-term changes in
   kinship-based cooperative behaviour resulting from the genetic and
   resource impacts of forecast changes to fire regimes in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{A hierarchy of processes operating at different spatial and temporal
   scales form landscape pattern, and changes to the patterns can have
   impacts on habitats and forest dwelling species. Managing landscapes
   under the auspices of sustainable forest ecosystems and emulation of
   natural disturbance requires knowledge of the scale at which landscapes
   are patterned. To better understand the role of natural disturbance in
   two distinct ecoregions of the Ontario boreal forest, we used thematic
   landcover maps derived from satellite imagery to evaluate differences in
   the relevant scales and nested hierarchies of forest pattern between two
   regions: northwest Ontario (relatively undisturbed forest and little
   fire suppression) and northeast Ontario (long history of forest harvest
   and fire suppression). We define a relevant scale as the spatial level
   where non-random patterning of landscape structure occurs. Similar
   nested hierarchies occurred in forest and wildfire disturbance classes
   in northwest Ontario. In contrast, the relevant scales detected in the
   northeast occurred at fewer levels and in the disturbance class, which
   was the result of forest harvest, at only one level. The differences
   detected between the two regions indicate that current forest harvest
   practices that focus on landscape alteration at a single scale are
   creating new landscapes that are different from the natural landscape.

Abstract = {{Fire is recognized as a keystone process in dry mixed-conifer forests
   that have been altered by decades of fire suppression. Restoration of
   fire disturbance to these forests is a guiding principle of resource
   management in the U.S. National Park Service. Policy implementation is
   often hindered by a poor understanding of forest conditions before fire
   exclusion, the characteristics of forest changes since excluding fire,
   and the influence of topographic or self-organizing controls on forest
   structure. In this study the spatial and temporal characteristics of
   fire regimes and forest structure are reconstructed in a 2125-ha
   mixed-conifer forest. Forests were multi-aged, burned frequently at low
   severity and fire-return interval, and forest structure did not vary
   with slope aspect, elevation, or slope position. Fire exclusion has
   caused an increase in forest density and basal area and a compositional
   shift to shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species. The median point
   fire-return interval and extent of a fire was 10 yr and 115 ha,
   respectively. The pre-Euro-American settlement fire rotation of 13 yr
   increased to 378 yr after 1905. The position of tire scars within tree
   rings indicates that 79\% of fires burned in the midsummer to fall
   period. The spatial pattern of burns exhibited self-organizing behavior.
   Area burned was 10-fold greater when an area had not been burned by the
   previous fire. Fires were frequent and widespread, but patches of
   similar aged trees were <0.2 ha, suggesting small fire-caused canopy
   openings. Managers need to apply multiple burns at short intervals for a
   sustained period to reduce surface fuels and create small canopy
   openings characteristic of the reference forest. By coupling explicit
   reference conditions with consideration of current conditions and
   projected climate change, management activities can balance restoration
   and risk management.}},

   was to determine prescribed burning and herbicide treatments effects on
   small mammal and herpetile communities within mid-rotation pine
   plantations in Mississippi. We established 4 treatments (herbicide only,
   herbicide/burn, bum only, control) with 6 replicates within thinned,
   mid-rotation (18-22 years old) loblolly pine (P. taeda) stands. We
   applied 697-872 ml/ha of Arsenal herbicide during September 1999 and
   conducted prescribed burning during January 2000. We captured small
   mammals and herpetiles to examine abundance, richness, and diversity as
   related to habitat conditions before and 2 years after treatment. We
   captured 15 species of small mammals and 21 species of herpetiles. Use
   of a skidder for herbicide application may have reduced small mammal
   richness and diversity during the first winter after treatment. Overall
   species diversity and richness did not differ between the pretreatment
   growing season and the first year post-treatment growing season.
   However, small mammals, particularly peromyscids, generally responded
   favorably to burning and burning with herbicide treatments the first and
   second growing seasons after treatment. Treatments in mid-rotation pine
   plantations that maintain early successional vegetation and open canopy
   structure should be beneficial to small mammal and herpetile
   communities, although more years of post-treatment response are needed
   to make definitive management recommendations.}},

   July 2007. Using a standardized census program that accounts for
   detectability, we have monitored the population trend of the species
   since Inagua was declared a Strict Nature Reserve in 1994. The breeding
   population density of the blue chaffinch remained stable in Inagua from
   the beginning of the monitoring program in 1994 until the year before

   therefore increase the global population or protect the blue chaffinch
   against a demographic crisis but probably prevented a deepening of the
   demographic crisis or further declines. Except for the two years
   immediately after the severe wildfire of 2007, the population density of

   9-16 birds/km(2), the lowest recorded abundance for a small woodland

Abstract = {{Chaparral shrublands in southern California, US, exhibit significant

   whether fire severity and distance from unburned fire perimeter
   influenced recovery of the small-mammal community from 13 to 39 months

   general, neither factor influenced small-mammal recovery. However,
   vegetation characteristics, distance to riparian habitat and the
   prevalence of rocky substrate affected recovery in species-specific
   patterns. This indicates the effects of fire severity and immigration
   from outside the fire perimeter, if they occur, do so within 1 year,

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of experimental fire regimes, (dormant season
   fire, growing season fire, growing season mowing and control, i.e., no
   experimental treatment) on populations of the USA federally endangered,
   Schwalbea americana L. between 1992 and 1996. Although this species
   occurs in fire-maintained habitat in the Southeastern USA, there is
   concern about the use of fire for such rare populations. The purpose of
   the study was to examine how seasonal timing of fire and fire
   suppression affect population demography, flowering phenology and
   spatial distribution; to identify modes of persistence associated with
   fire regimes; and to determine if summer mowing provides a management
   alternative to fire. Fire-induced flowering was demonstrated in this
   species. Seasonal timing of burns appears to have relatively little
   consequence on population structure or spatial extent, but alters
   flowering phenology. Burning, regardless of season, resulted in
   increased population density and expansion in areal extent. Two possible
   mechanisms of persistence between fire events were identified including
   regression from reproductive stage to vegetative stage in the absence of
   fire and dormancy of individual plants for one or more seasons. Growing
   season mowing does not appear to be an adequate substitute for burning.}},

Pages = {{477-486}},
Abstract = {{This study summarises the results of a patchy, low-intensity
   hazard-reduction burn on the small mammals and lizards of Mumbulla State
   Forest and Biamanga National Park. About half of the study sites in the
   patchwork of alternate logging regrowth and unlogged forest were burnt
   in April 1999. Prior to burning (winter 1998), there were significantly
   more Antechinus agilis in those north-west-facing sites that burnt in
   1999, than in the south-east sites that burnt. By 15 months post-burning
   this trend had reversed, with more A. agilis in the burnt south-east
   sites. In contrast, burning had an initially positive effect on the
   abundance of Rattus fuscipes, with significantly more in the burnt
   south-east than burnt north-west sites four months post-burning compared
   with 1998 (pre-burning). This influence of aspect may be attributable to
   the fact that fires generally burn more intensely on the drier
   north-west slopes, removing more of the leaf litter and vegetative cover
   and making post-fire conditions harsher. Antechinus swainsonii became
   extremely scarce in the forest after the burning. Twenty months
   post-burning (summer 2000), there were significantly more Lampropholis
   delicata in the unburnt sites than in the burnt sites compared with 1999
   (10 months post-burn). Lampropholis guichenoti were affected to a much
   lesser extent and recovered quickly, and Eulamprus heatwolei were
   generally unaffected by the burning. The hazard-reduction burn came 19
   years after a high-intensity bushfire and logging operation in this
   forest. The results of the two fires were similar for the two Antechinus
   species and the Eulamprus species but contrasted for the other species.
   Hazard-reduction burning is widespread and accepted as a management tool
   and, following the New South Wales bushfires of 1994-95 and 2001-02,
   will probably increase in use. Our results, however, suggest that the
   biodiversity impacts of burning are complex and multidirectional, posing
   a significant challenge to conservation managers.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{28-37}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{External threats from agricultural intensification, fire encroachment,
   species invasion and illegal harvesting present major conservation
   challenges in isolated tropical forest remnants. These processes can
   greatly exacerbate the magnitude of edge effects as the degree of patch
   to matrix contrast increases. Theory suggests that mitigation of these
   effects should be possible through conservation strategies that remove
   external threats and restore adjacent matrix structure, but this has not
   been tested experimentally. In the rapidly-dwindling Afromontane
   rainforests of Nigeria, where nature reserves have the least protection
   of all African conservation areas, we created an experimental matrix
   restoration treatment in which we excluded livestock by fencing,
   maintained a fire-exclusion break, and passively revegetated a 200 m
   buffer zone in the surrounding matrix at replicated edges. After three
   years, dung beetle communities in remnant forests showed a 53\% increase
   in abundance at sites adjacent to the restored matrix. Over 90\% of the
   common dung beetle species differed in the magnitude of their edge
   responses between forest-to-restored versus forest-to-degraded matrix
   sites. Moreover, a significant difference in species richness across the
   forest-to-degraded matrix edge became non-significant following matrix
   restoration, and there was also a significant decrease in community
   dissimilarity across the edge gradient in these regenerating sites. Just
   three years after excluding threatening processes from comparatively
   small areas of matrix habitat, we found that these efforts not only
   reduced edge effects, but also (1) enhanced dung beetle populations in
   the adjacent reserve, (2) led to an increase in dung beetle capture
   rates in the regenerating matrix, and (3) facilitated re-establishment
   of species that were absent due to matrix degradation. Therefore,
   regenerating buffers can substantially increase effective reserve size
   and restore invertebrate communities in landscape mosaics where remnant
   habitats are embedded within anthropogenic landscapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is becoming a common management tool for restoring
   forests of North America; however, effects of prescribed fire on
   forest-dwelling bats remain unclear. During 2006 and 2007, we monitored
   prey availability, diet, foraging behavior, and roost selection of adult
   female northern bats (Myotis septentrionalis) before and after 2
   prescribed fires in dissected terrain of the Red River Gorge on the
   Daniel Boone National Forest in eastern Kentucky. Size of home ranges
   and core areas did not vary between bats radiotracked before and after
   fires. Bats foraged more often in the vicinity of pine stands than
   hardwood or mixed stands, and along ridges and midslopes than lower
   slopes, regardless of burn condition. Home ranges were closer to burned
   habitats following fires than to unburned habitats. Abundance of
   coleopterans, dipterans, and all insects combined captured in blacklight
   traps increased following prescribed fires. Fecal samples of bats
   demonstrated lepidopterans, coleopterans, and dipterans to be the 3 most
   important groups of insect prey, with consumption of dipterans
   increasing after burning. Bats chose roosts that were taller in height
   and in earlier stages of decay than random snags, and after prescribed
   fires chose roosts in trees with a greater number of cavities and a
   higher percentage of bark coverage. More roosts were observed in burned
   habitats (74.3\%; n = 26) after fires than in unburned habitats (25.7\%;
   n = 9). The results of this work suggest that northern bats are tolerant
   to prescribed fire on the landscape pattern and scale observed in this
   study. Northern bats responded to habitat alterations resulting from
   prescribed fires through shifts in the location of foraging areas as
   bats tracked changes in insect availability, and through shifts in the
   selection of roost trees by occupying trees and snags possessing more
   potential roosting microsites.}},

Abstract = {{Amazonia (sensu lato) is by far the largest tropical forest region, but
   has succumbed to the highest absolute rates of tropical deforestation
   and forest degradation, driven by rapid frontier expansion,
   road-building, and spontaneous or government-subsidized migration. The
   large area-through-time and paleo-climatic stability of Amazonian
   forests may help explain the high regional to local scale plant and
   animal species diversity of true forest specialists and high ecological
   sensitivity to contemporary land-use change. We describe the prevailing
   forms of anthropogenic disturbance that affect forest organisms in the
   context of the geographic and evolutionary background that has shaped
   the degree to which forest species may be resilient to environmental
   change. The fate of Amazonian biodiversity will partly depend upon the
   interaction between land-use and climate change, and the extent to which
   seasonally-dry forests can retain immunity against catastrophic
   recurrent wildfires. This review illustrates the importance of
   considering interactions between different forms of forest disturbance
   to develop effective conservation policy. We conclude with some
   considerations of the policy agenda necessary to protect forest cover
   and forest biodiversity at a meaningful scale across the Amazonian

Abstract = {{Trophic interactions and disturbance events can shape the structure and
   function of ecosystems. However, the effects of drivers such as
   predation, fire and climatic variables on species distributions are
   rarely considered concurrently. We used a replicated landscape-scale
   predator management experiment to compare the effects of red fox Vulpes
   vulpes control, time-since-fire, vegetation type and other environmental
   variables on native herbivore distributions. Occurrence data for four
   native herbivores and an invasive predator - the red fox - were
   collected from 240 sites across three baited (for lethal fox control)
   and three unbaited forest blocks (4659-9750 ha) in south-western
   Victoria, Australia, and used to build species distribution models. The
   herbivore taxa were as follows: red-necked wallaby Macropus rufogriseus,
   black wallaby Wallabia bicolour, grey kangaroo Macropus fuligenosus and
   Macropus giganteus and common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula.
   Fox control and fire had little effect on herbivore occurrence, despite
   the literature suggesting it can influence abundance, while climate,
   proximity to farmland and topography were more influential. This may be
   because the region's high productivity and agricultural pastures
   subsidise food resources for both predators and prey within the forest
   blocks and so dampen trophic interactions. Alternatively, these drivers
   may affect herbivore abundance, but not herbivore occurrence.
   Understanding the drivers of herbivore distributions is an important
   step in predicting the effects of herbivory on other species,
   particularly after management interventions such as predator control and
   prescribed burns.}},

Title = {{Wildfire and the ecological niche: Diminishing habitat suitability for
   an indicator species within semi-arid ecosystems}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Globally accelerating frequency and extent of wildfire threatens the
   persistence of specialist wildlife species through direct loss of
   habitat and indirect facilitation of exotic invasive species. Habitat
   specialists may be especially prone to rapidly changing environmental
   conditions because their ability to adapt lags behind the rate of
   habitat alteration. As a result, these populations may become
   increasingly susceptible to ecological traps by returning to suboptimal
   breeding habitats that were dramatically altered by disturbance. We
   demonstrate a multistage modeling approach that integrates habitat
   selection and survival during the key nesting life-stage of a bird
   species of high conservation concern, the greater sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter, sage-grouse). We applied these
   spatially explicit models to a spatiotemporally robust dataset of
   sage-grouse nest locations and fates across wildfire-altered sagebrush
   ecosystems of the Great Basin ecoregion, western United States. Female
   sage-grouse exhibited intricate habitat selection patterns that varied
   across regional gradients of ecological productivity among sagebrush
   communities, but often selected nest sites that disproportionately
   resulted in nest failure. For example, 23\% of nests occurred in
   wildfire-affected habitats characterized by reduced sagebrush cover and
   greater composition of invasive annual grasses. We found survival of
   nests was negatively associated with wildfire-affected areas, but
   positively associated with higher elevations with increased ruggedness
   and overall shrub cover. Strong site fidelity likely drove sage-grouse
   to continue nesting in habitats degraded by wildfire. Hence, increasing
   frequency and extent of wildfire may contribute disproportionately to
   reduced reproductive success by creating ecological traps that act as
   population sinks. Identifying such habitat mismatches between selection
   and survival facilitates deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving
   reduced geographic niche space and population decline at broad
   spatiotemporal scales, while guiding management actions to areas that
   would be most beneficial to the species.}},

Abstract = {{Forest managers use prescribed fire to reduce wildfire risk and to
   provide resource benefits, yet little information is available on
   whether prescribed fires can function as ecological surrogates for
   wildfire in fire-prone landscapes. Information on impacts and benefits
   of this management tool on stream and riparian ecosystems is
   particularly lacking. We used a beyond-BACI (Before, After, Control,
   Impact) design to investigate the effects of a prescribed fire on a
   stream ecosystem and compared these findings to similar data collected
   after wildfire. For 3 years after prescribed fire treatment, we found no
   detectable changes in periphyton, macroinvertebrates, amphibians, fish,
   and riparian and stream habitats compared to data collected over the
   same time period in four unburned reference streams. Based on changes in
   fuels, plant and litter cover, and tree scorching, this prescribed fire
   was typical of those being implemented in ponderosa pine forests
   throughout the western U.S. However, we found that the extent and
   severity of riparian vegetation burned was substantially lower after
   prescribed fire compared to nearby wildfires. The early-season
   prescribed fire did not mimic the riparian or in-stream ecological
   effects observed following a nearby wildfire, even in catchments with
   burn extents similar to the prescribed fire. Little information exists
   on the effects of long-term fire exclusion from riparian forests, but a

Abstract = {{Fire is returning to many conifer-dominated forests where species
   composition and structure have been altered by fire exclusion.
   Ecological effects of these fires are influenced strongly by the degree
   of forest change during the fire-free period. Response of fire-adapted
   species assemblages to extended fire-free intervals is highly variable,
   even in communities with similar historical fire regimes. This
   variability in plant community response to fire exclusion is not well
   understood; however, ecological mechanisms such as individual species'
   adaptations to disturbance or competition and underlying site
   characteristics that facilitate or impede establishment and growth have
   been proposed as potential drivers of assemblage response. We used
   spatially explicit dendrochronological reconstruction of tree population
   dynamics and fire regimes to examine the influence of historical
   disturbance frequency (a proxy for adaptation to disturbance or
   competition), and potential site productivity (a proxy for underlying
   site characteristics) on the stability of forest composition and
   structure along a continuous ecological gradient of pine, dry
   mixed-conifer, mesic mixed-conifer, and spruce-fir forests following
   fire exclusion. While average structural density increased in all
   forests, species composition was relatively stable in the lowest
   productivity pine-dominated and highest productivity
   spruce-fir-dominated sites immediately following fire exclusion and for
   the next 100 years, suggesting site productivity as a primary control on
   species composition and structure in forests with very different
   historical fire regimes. Species composition was least stable on
   intermediate productivity sites dominated by mixed-conifer forests,
   shifting from primarily fire-adapted species to competition-adapted,
   fire-sensitive species within 20 years of fire exclusion. Rapid changes
   to species composition and stand densities have been interpreted by some
   as evidence of high-severity fire. We demonstrate that the very
   different ecological process of fire exclusion can produce similar
   changes by shifting selective pressures from disturbance-mediated to
   productivity-mediated controls. Restoring disturbance-adapted species
   composition and structure to intermediate productivity forests may help
   to buffer them against projected increasing temperatures, lengthening
   fire seasons, and more frequent and prolonged moisture stress. Fewer
   management options are available to promote adaptation in forest
   assemblages historically constrained by underlying site productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystems are declining due to
   biological invasions and changes in fire regimes. Understanding how
   ecosystem changes influence functionally important animals such as
   ecosystem engineers is essential to conserve ecological functions.
   American badgers (Taxidea taxus) are an apex predator and ecosystem
   engineer in that they redistribute large amounts of soil within
   sagebrush ecosystems. Piute ground squirrels (Urocitellus mollis) are
   also an ecosystem engineer as well as an essential prey resource for
   many predators, including badgers. Our research objective was to
   evaluate the relative importance of biological invasions and fire,
   abiotic factors, and biotic factors on badgers and ground squirrels. We
   sampled 163 1-ha plots during April-June across a gradient of burn
   histories within a 1962 km(2) study area in southern Idaho, USA. At each
   plot, we characterized occupancy of ground squirrels and badgers and
   relative abundance of ground squirrels. Additionally, we characterized
   soil texture, climate, connectivity and dispersal potential, fire
   frequency, grazing, and cover of many plant species including a highly
   invasive exotic annual grass (cheatgrass; Bromus tectorum). We used an
   integrated approach to evaluate competing hypotheses concerning factors
   influencing occupancy and abundance. Results suggested that occupancy of
   ground squirrels was positively associated with long-term precipitation,
   dispersal potential, and fine-grained soil. Abundance of ground
   squirrels was positively associated with fine-grained soil, but
   negatively associated with cheatgrass, fire frequency, agriculture, and
   shrub cover. Badger occupancy was positively associated with ground
   squirrel occupancy and agriculture, which indicated affinity to prey.
   Our results provide insight into the relative influence of abiotic and
   biotic factors on predator and prey, and highlight how effects change
   across different population parameters. Our research suggests that
   widespread environmental change within sagebrush ecosystems, especially
   the fire-cheatgrass cycle (e.g., invasion of cheatgrass and increased
   fire frequency) and human land disturbances, are directly and indirectly
   influencing ground squirrels and badgers. However, we also found
   evidence that efforts to mitigate these stressors, for example,
   establishing bunchgrasses postfire, may provide targeted conservation
   strategies that promote these species and thus preserve the burrowing
   and trophic functions they provide.}},

   individual species to management history (prescribed fire). This is
   contrary to what would be expected for a degraded pine barrens and
   questions the efficacy of using repeated prescribed fire as a management
   tool in bracken-grasslands. Methods for conservation and restoration of
   xeric ecosystems of northern Wisconsin have historically relied heavily
   on single species (e.g., sharp-tailed grouse) wildlife models, without
   full consideration of other factors. We suggest that stakeholders
   involved in these restoration projects examine historic processes and
   reference conditions prior to formulating management goals. Greater
   attention to the differentiation and individual management needs of pine
   barrens, northern-dry forests, and bracken-grasslands is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Fire plays a pivotal role in structuring ecosystems and often occurs as
   a human-mediated disturbance for land management purposes. An important
   component of fire regime is the season of burn. In tropical savannas,
   most fire management occurs during the dry season; however, wet season
   burning is often used for pastoral management and may be useful for
   controlling introduced plant species. We used replicated, experimental
   fire treatments (unburnt, dry season burnt and wet season burnt),
   spanning two habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland), to examine
   the short- (within 12 months of fire) and longer-term (within four years
   of fire) changes of bird assemblages in response to wet and dry season
   burning in tropical savannas of northern Australia. Within 12 months of
   fire, we observed higher abundances of birds in the burnt treatments,
   although some species (e.g., red-backed fairy-wren, Malurus
   melanocephalus) were rarely observed in burnt sites. Dry season burnt
   sites contained higher abundances of insectivores and granivores, while
   wet season burnt sites had more carnivores. Four years following
   burning, dry season burnt sites were characterized by lower abundances,
   especially of nectarivores and granivores. Dry season burnt sites also
   contained a different assemblage than wet season burnt sites, but few
   differences were observed between wet season burnt and unburnt sites.
   Our results confirm that differences in fire regimes can substantially
   alter bird assemblages, especially in riparian zones, and emphasize the
   importance of incorporating burning season in fire management
   strategies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbed xeric grasslands with short, sparse vegetation provide
   breeding habitat for mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) across the
   western Great Plains. Maintaining local disturbance regimes through
   prairie dog conservation and prescribed fire may contribute to the
   sustainability of recently declining mountain plover populations, but
   these management approaches can be controversial. We estimated
   habitat-specific mountain plover densities and nest survival rates on
   black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and burns in
   the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Mountain plover
   densities were similar on prairie dog colonies (5.9 birds/km(2); 95\% CI
   = 4.7-7.4) and sites burned during the preceding dormant season (6.7
   birds/km(2); 95\% CI = 4.6-9.6), whereas the 29-day nest survival rate
   was greater on prairie dog colonies (0.81 in 2011 and 0.39 in 2012)
   compared to the burned sites (0.64 in 2011 and 0.17 in 2012). Reduced
   nest survival in 2012 compared to 2011 was associated with higher
   maximum daily temperatures in 2012, consistent with a previous
   weather-based model of mountain plover nest survival in the southern
   Great Plains. Measurements of mountain plover density relative to time
   since disturbance showed that removal of prairie dog disturbance by
   sylvatic plague reduced mountain plover density by 70\% relative to
   active prairie dog colonies after 1 year. Plover densities declined at a
   similar rate (by 78\%) at burned sites between the first and second
   post-burn growing season. Results indicate that black-tailed prairie dog
   colonies are a particularly important nesting habitat for mountain
   plovers in the southern Great Plains. In addition, findings suggest that
   prescribed burning can be a valuable means to create nesting habitat in
   landscapes where other types of disturbances (such as prairie dog
   colonies) are limited in distribution and size. Published 2014. This

Abstract = {{A 5-yr study to evaluate the influence of annual and biennial prescribed
   burning in March on the abundance of Amblyomma americanum (L.) was
   conducted on Oconee Wildlife Management Area in the Piedmont
   physiographic region of Georgia. Tick abundance on plots embedded in
   larger burned and unburned areas were monitored with cloth drags and
   CO2-baited cloth panels monthly during March through September from 1987
   through 1991. Annual and biennial prescribed burning from 1988 to 1991
   significantly reduced the abundance of larvae, nymphs, and adults but
   did not alter their seasonal trends of abundance. Annual burning more
   consistently supressed all life stages than biennial burning. The
   magnitude of tick supression tended to increase with sucessive burns,
   especially with the annual burning regime. The order of vulnerability to
   direct incineration appeared to be overwintered larvae > adults >
   nymphs; however, only overwintered larvae were highly vulnerable.
   Consistent reductions in larvae during June-September following burning
   were associated with reduced litter depths and presumably lowered
   habitat suitability. During years of fire omission, the abundance of
   larvae on biennially burned plots increased to levels equal to or
   exceeding those on unburned plots. Based on cloth drag sampling, mean
   percentage control during 1988-1991 for larvae, nymphs, and adults,

Abstract = {{Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), a common species in North
   America, is a minor species in the Sierra Nevada of California. However,
   the limited coverage of aspen in this area appears to carry a
   disproportionate biodiversity load: numerous species are dependent on
   the unique components of aspen forests for habitat. Land managers in the
   region believe the species is declining due to fire suppression policies
   of the past century. Recent research from other regions shows mixed
   results when assessing the extent of decline. This review focuses on the
   crossroads between human and natural history to describe a broader
   picture of aspen ecology in the Sierra Nevada. The method used here
   combines a review of the ecological literature with historical
   synthesis. A central conclusion is that the current ``decline{''} in
   aspen must be placed in the context of an unusual regeneration pulse
   brought on by intensive Euro-American resource extraction activities of
   the late 19th century. We address unique features of the Sierra aspen
   population, the interface of climate change and human-caused
   disturbance, and conservation strategies for restoration of an aspen
   community more closely aligned with contemporary climate-disturbance
   cycles. Conservation recommendations include reintroduction of
   mixed-severity natural fires and complimentary wildlife, such as top

Abstract = {{Identifying factors that influence the survival of individuals during
   disturbance is critical to understanding patterns of species reassembly
   within ecological communities. Although most studies of recovery of
   populations post-burning acknowledge the potentially important
   contribution of animals surviving in situ, few have measured the
   effectiveness of refugia. This paper tests the hypothesis that some
   plants with tightly packed leaf-bases provide a refuge for invertebrates
   during fire (even when the plants themselves burn) by using the highly
   flammable grass tree (Xanthorrhoeaceae: Xanthorrhoea). Invertebrates
   were sampled from four unburnt and five experimentally burnt grass trees
   (Xanthorrhoea preissii Endl.). Also collected were invertebrates fleeing
   during burning. The dataset comprises 949 specimens, representing 81
   species from 18 orders, of which 749 individuals were from unburned
   plants. Slaters (Isopoda), silverfish (Thysanura), spiders (Araneae) and
   bugs (Hemiptera) dominated assemblages of the unburnt grass trees.
   Despite grass trees burning at temperatures of up to 515 degrees C, some
   invertebrates survived in situ. Species-specific microhabitat
   preferences within the plant appeared to influence survivorship. Species
   collected in the crown of unburned plants were found more often alive on
   burnt plants than species typically inhabiting the dead skirt of
   decaying leaves (thatch). We contend that the mechanism causing
   differential mortality is fire temperature. In the dead skirt,
   temperatures reached 225.33 +/- 66.57 degrees C. In contrast, a region
   of mild temperature (25.00 +/- 3.54 degrees C) persisted throughout
   burning near the apical meristem (within the crown). We conclude that
   grass trees are a potential reservoir from which invertebrates might
   re-colonize recently burnt areas. However, owing to species-specific
   microhabitat preferences and differential mortality across
   microhabitats, the invertebrate assemblage remaining in situ will be
   restricted taxonomically compared with the original grass tree fauna.
   Moreover, different fire regimes might mediate the effectiveness of
   grass trees as refugia. Finally, we argue that in situ survival of
   invertebrates within plants with tightly packed leaf-bases is an
   unrecognized global phenomenon applicable to a wide array of plant taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Saproxylic insect assemblages associated with burned forests are
   generally abundant and species rich, consisting of a mix of pyrophilous
   and secondary, opportunistic species depending on time elapsed since

   they may respond differentially to habitat fragmentation caused by
   salvage logging, with pyrophilous species having a much higher dispersal
   potential. In a 2-year-old burn highly fragmented by pre- and post-fire
   logging, we sampled saproxylic beetles in coniferous and broadleaf
   burned residual stands along a gradient of spatial context including
   intensity of fragmentation and isolation from source habitat using
   Lindgren multiple-funnels traps. Beetle assemblages differed in
   composition between coniferous and broadleaf burned stands, with
   secondary users dominating the latter. Pyrophilous species increased in
   abundance with distance from the edge and avoided unburned patches
   within the fire. Secondary users did not respond negatively to
   fragmentation or isolation of burned habitats, with one exception, the
   alleculid Isomira quadristriata (Couper), being overall diverse and
   abundant throughout the study area regardless of salvage logging
   prevalence. No deleterious effects of isolation were thus detected in
   the occurrence patterns of secondary users, even up to 8km from the
   edge. Our results suggest that older burns, especially those having some
   broadleaf cover, are intensively used by non-pyrophilous saproxylic
   species usually associated with dead wood in green forests and may
   contribute to maintain broader saproxylic assemblages than originally

Abstract = {{Grassland birds are in steep decline throughout many regions of the
   world. In North America, even some common species have declined by >
   50\% over the last few decades. Declines in grassland bird populations
   have generally been attributed to widespread agricultural conversion of
   grasslands; more than 80\% of North American grasslands have been
   converted to agriculture and other land uses, for example. Remaining
   large grasslands should thus be especially important to the conservation
   of grassland birds. The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma (USA)
   preserves the largest intact tallgrass prairie (similar to 2 million ha)
   left in the world. The Flint Hills supports a major cattle industry,
   however, and therefore experiences widespread grazing and frequent
   burning. We assessed the regional population status of three grassland
   birds that are considered the core of the avian community in this region
   (Dickcissel, Spiza americana; Grasshopper Sparrow, Ammodramus
   savannarum; Eastern Meadowlark, Sturnella magna). our approach is
   founded on a demographic analysis that additionally explores how to
   model variability in empirically derived estimates of reproductive
   success across a large heterogeneous landscape, which ultimately
   requires the translation of demographic data from local (plot) to
   regional scales. We found that none of these species is demographically
   viable at a regional scale under realistic assumptions, with estimated
   population declines of 3-290/o/year and a likelihood of regional
   viability of 0-45\% over the two years of study. Current land-management
   practices may thus be exacerbating grassland bird declines by degrading

Abstract = {{The use of poorly estimated or surrogate population parameter estimates
   to assess population viability may result in misleading predictions.
   Consequently, a critical first step to understanding population health
   and the effects of land management practices on threatened species is
   estimation of site-specific demographic parameters. A major threat to
   the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is habitat loss due to
   encroachment of woody vegetation and invasive species. Current land
   management practices require periodic burning or mowing to maintain
   habitat suitability. Although these methods improve habitat quality,
   they may also increase the risk of depredation due to reduced ground
   cover if burns are too extensive or cause mortality if conducted when
   snakes are active. We fitted contemporary capture-recapture and matrix
   models to an 8-year dataset to estimate population parameters for an
   eastern massasauga population near the range center of the species,
   where the largest number of eastern massasauga populations may still
   persist. From 2009 to 2016, we captured 826 eastern massasaugas 1,776
   times. In general, annual survival increased with increasing age (age
   0=0.38, age 1=0.65, age 2=0.67, age 3 females=0.71, age 3 males=0.66).
   Abundance estimates ranged from 84 to 140 adults and annual reproductive
   frequency was 0.44 (95\% CI=0.29-0.59). We simulated increased mortality
   due to prescribed burns during spring, fall, and late fall for 50 and
   100 years. The baseline model, which incorporated current
   prescribed-fire practices, indicated a stable population with only a
   0.2-0.6\% probability of extinction over 100 years, suggesting that
   management practices at this site are sustainable if they remain
   unchanged. Simulations of conservative increases in mortality due to
   fire changed the probability of extinction little over 50 years (0.7\%)
   but increased probability of extinction up to 24.5\% over 100 years in
   the most pessimistic prescribed-burn scenario. These prescribed-burn
   simulations may be comparable to burn regimes used at other eastern
   massasauga sites. The population parameters estimated here provide
   information needed for assessing range-wide population viability and
   investigating geographic variation in eastern massasauga demography. (c)

   We estimated a suite of eastern massasauga population parameters using
   an 8-year capture-recapture dataset and simulated the effects prescribed

Abstract = {{We surveyed butterflies in prairies, pine-oak barrens, and degraded
   grasslands during 1988-2013 in southern Wisconsin, USA. In prairie
   preserves (primarily managed with frequent fire), both specialist and
   non-specialist ``grassland{''} grass-skippers declined strongly.
   Specialists inhabiting the native herbaceous flora of pine-oak barrens
   that had little management but relatively consistent vegetation over
   time had large fluctuations but more stable trends. Grassland
   grass-skippers showed similar more stable trends in barrens and degraded
   fields with relatively consistent vegetation over time. Significant
   population trends did not relate clearly to how southerly the species'
   ranges are. Specialist and grassland grass-skipper persistence after
   prairie preservation correlated negatively with both number of years
   since preservation and prairie patch size. We also analyzed
   grass-skipper abundance during 1977-2012 in midwestern 4th of July
   Butterfly Counts, an annual volunteer butterfly census. Specialists
   declined significantly but grassland as well as forest and wetland
   grass-skippers averaged a non-trend. We hypothesize that the reasons why
   fire management is adverse are because of direct mortality and also the
   thick tall grass regrowth, which may be unsuitable for larvae to use. It
   appears urgent to identify and implement management strategies in
   prairie preserves that consistently maintain grassland vegetation as
   required by grass-skippers in ways the grass-skippers themselves

Abstract = {{1. A replicated experiment was done in plots in a stand of reed

   Invertebrates in the soil were sampled by heat extraction and

   stems and in situ counting.
   2. Only a few families showed differences between treatments, and this
   number declined with time after treatment. After 1 year, no soil
   invertebrates and only a few families of above-ground invertebrates
   showed any significant treatment effects.
   3. Most treatment effects were between the unmanaged control and both
   cut and burnt plots. A significant difference between cut and burnt
   treatments was recorded for only one family, with numbers lower in the
   cut plots.
   4. Total number of invertebrates, species-richness, species diversity

Title = {{Effects of tree cutting and fire on understory vegetation in mixed
   conifer forests}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{335}},
Pages = {{281-299}},

Abstract = {{Mixed conifer forests of western North America are challenging for fire
   management, as historical fire regimes were highly variable in severity,
   timing, and spatial extent. Complex fire histories combined with site
   factors and other disturbances, such insect outbreaks, led to great
   variation in understory plant communities, and management activities
   influence future dynamics of both overstory and understory communities.
   This variation needs to be considered as part of ecosystem-scale efforts
   to influence future fires and restore the composition and structure of
   mixed conifer forests. We undertook a systematic review of published
   studies evaluating effects of tree cutting and fire on understory
   vegetation in western North American mixed conifer forests. Forty-one
   studies, published in 50 articles, met inclusion criteria and
   encompassed projects in seven states in the USA and British Columbia in
   Canada. Total understory plant abundance (cover, biomass, or density)
   commonly declined in the short term within 4 years after treatment. This
   may result from damage to plants during tree cutting operations or fire,
   heavy loadings of slash, little change or even expansion of tree
   canopies after low-intensity treatments, herbivory, or drought. In
   contrast, all 7 studies measuring understories longer than 5 years since
   treatment reported increases in understory metrics. Treatments in these
   long-term studies also persistently decreased tree canopy cover. Most or
   all native species endured (even if reduced in abundance) through
   cutting operations or fire. A model of understory response has emerged
   that treatments generally do not eliminate species, and often benefit
   species absent or uncommon in untreated forest. Groups of native species
   (e.g., Epilobium spp.) appear fire-dependent, because they are uncommon
   or absent in unburned mixed conifer forests and after tree cutting
   alone. Cutting and prescribed fire applied together resulted in the
   greatest invasion of non-native plants, but non-native cover was minimal
   compared to native cover. Few studies examined influences of intensity
   of tree cutting or severity of prescribed fire, but overstory understory
   relationships suggest that treatments must substantially reduce
   overstory density from maximum values (which can exceed 3000 stems
   ha(-1) and 80 m(2) ha(-1) basal area) and tree canopy cover to <30-50\%
   cover to elicit appreciable responses from the forest understory. Few
   studies examined understory dynamics after wildfire relative to unburned
   forest, and further work is warranted because wildfire is a likely
   eventual outcome of passive management in these forests. Across a broad
   region from the southwestern United States into Canada, prescribed fire
   and tree cutting consistently increased disturbance-promoted native
   species in the short term and total understory abundance in the long
   term. Active management using tree cutting and fire will likely benefit
   both biodiversity conservation and fire management in current mixed
   conifer forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used as a management practice to maintain grassland
   dominance and reduce woody plant encroachment on grasslands and
   rangelands. Little is known regarding effects of these fires on CO2
   fluxes and their potential contribution to atmospheric CO2. The
   objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the effect of fire on net
   ecosystem CO2 flux above Prosopis glandulosa Torr. (honey mesquite

   and (2) to compare these fluxes to fluxes determined by an empirical
   model that scaled measurement,, of leaf photosynthesis and leaf area of
   dominant species and soil CO2 fluxes to the ecosystem level.
   Measurements were made during a wet year ( 19951) and a dry year (1996)
   with different Savanna areas burned in late winter (February-March) each
   year. In the wet year, BREB-estimated daily (24-h) CO2 flux averaged
   -0.1, 14.6. and 0.8 g/m(2) on the unburned plot. and 15.7. 19.7, and
   15.2 g/m(2) on the burned plot during spring, summer, and fall periods,
   respectively. during the first growing season following the fire
   (positive mean net CO2 uptake). In the drought year, mean daily CO2 flux
   during spring. summer, and fall was -9.2, 4.1 and 4.8 g/m(2) n the
   unburned plot. and 8.1, -0.9. and 4.0 g/m(2) on the burned plot
   respectively. The increased carbon uptake following a fire when compared
   to the unburned plot was estimated to offset the initial carbon loss
   from combustion within 28 growing-season days in the wet year, while it
   took 82 d in the dry year. Empirically determined daylight (12-h) CO2
   fluxes. measured on two midsummer days each year, averaged 17.9 g/ m(2)
   when determined by BREB, and 12.0 g/m(2) when calculated from scaled-up

   prescription, which was based on the best available management and

   irregular openings of less than 40 acres by harvesting most of the
   juniper trees. Openings retained a minimum of 40 selected trees per 40
   acres and were surrounded by unharvested areas. Alligator juniper
   sprouts were controlled by prescribed fire. Monitoring indicated more
   plant species, higher density of herbaceous species, more litter cover,
   and less exposed rock and bare soil in treated than in adjacent
   unharvested sites. Forage production on the harvested areas was higher
   than in unharvested areas. The landscape contains a more diverse mix of

Abstract = {{Managers require quantitative yet tractable tools that identify areas
   for restoration yielding effective benefits for targeted wildlife
   species and the ecosystems they inhabit. As a contemporary example of
   high national significance for conservation, the persistence of Greater
   Sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the Great Basin is
   compromised by strongly interacting stressors of conifer expansion,
   annual grass invasion, and more frequent wildfires occurring in
   sagebrush ecosystems. Associated restoration treatments to a
   sagebrush-dominated state are often costly and may yield relatively
   little ecological benefit to sage-grouse if implemented without
   estimating how Sage-grouse may respond to treatments, or do not consider
   underlying processes influencing sagebrush ecosystem resilience to
   disturbance and resistance to invasive species. Here, we describe
   example applications of a spatially explicit conservation planning tool
   (CPT) to inform prioritization of: (1) removal of conifers (i.e.,
   pinyon-juniper); and (2) wildfire restoration aimed at improving habitat
   conditions for the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment of Sage-grouse
   along the California-Nevada state line. The CPT measures ecological
   benefits to sage-grouse for a given management action through a
   composite index comprised of resource selection functions and estimates
   of abundance and space use. For pinyon-juniper removal, we simulated
   changes in land-cover composition following the removal of sparse trees
   with intact understories, and ranked treatments on the basis of changes
   in ecological benefits per dollar-unit of cost. For wildfire
   restoration, we formulated a conditional model to simulate scenarios for
   land cover changes (e.g., sagebrush to annual grass) given estimated
   fire severity and underlying ecosystem processes influencing resilience
   to disturbance and resistance to invasion by annual grasses. For both
   applications, we compared CPT rankings to land cover changes along with
   sagebrush resistance and resilience metrics. Model results demonstrated
   how the CPT can be an important step in identifying management projects
   that yield the highest quantifiable benefit to Sage-grouse while
   avoiding costly misallocation of resources, and highlight the importance
   of considering changes in sage-grouse ecological response and factors
   influencing sagebrush ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance
   to invasion. This unique framework can be adopted to help inform other
   management questions aimed at improving habitat for other species across
   sagebrush and other ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological restoration of fire-suppressed habitats may require a
   multifaceted approach. Removal of hardwood trees together with
   reintroduction of fire has been suggested as a method of restoring
   fire-suppressed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests; however, this
   strategy, although widespread, has not been evaluated on large spatial
   and temporal scales. We used a landscape-scale experimental design to
   examine how bird assemblages in fire-suppressed longleaf pine sandhills
   responded to fire alone or fire following mechanical removal or
   herbicide application to reduce hardwood levels. Individual treatments
   were compared to fire-suppressed controls and reference sites. After
   initial treatment, all sites were managed with prescribed fire, on an
   approximately two-to three-year interval, for over a decade. Nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling ordinations suggested that avian assemblages on
   sites that experienced any form of hardwood removal differed from
   assemblages on both fire-suppressed sites and reference sites 3-4 years
   after treatment (i.e., early posttreatment). After >10 years of
   prescribed burning on all sites (i.e., late posttreatment), only
   assemblages at sites treated with herbicide were indistinguishable from
   assemblages at reference sites. By the end of the study, individual
   species that were once indicators of reference sites no longer
   contributed to making reference sites unique. Occupancy modeling of
   these indicator species also demonstrated increasing similarity across
   treatments over time. Overall, although we documented long-term and
   variable assemblage-level change, our results indicate occupancy for
   birds considered longleaf pine specialists was similar at treatment and
   reference sites after over a decade of prescribed burning, regardless of
   initial method of hardwood removal. In other words, based on the
   response of species highly associated with the habitat, we found no
   justification for the added cost and effort of fire surrogates; fire
   alone was sufficient to restore these species.}},

Abstract = {{Imperata grassland at Dorgakona, Barak valley, North Eastern India was
   analyzed for species composition and diversity pattern in relation to
   traditional management practices. 19 families were in the burnt and
   unburnt plots of the study site with Poaceae as the most dominant one.
   29 species occurred in the burnt plot and 28 in the unburnt plot. Most
   of the species were common in both the plots. The pattern of frequency
   diagrams indicated that the vegetation was homogeneous. Imperata
   cylindrica, a rhizomatous grass was the dominant species based on
   density (318.75 and 304.18 nos. m(-2)), basal cover (158.22 and 148.34
   cm(2) m(-2)) and Importance value index (IVI) (132.64 and 138.74) for
   the burnt and unburnt plots respectively. Borreria pusilla was the
   co-dominant species constituting Imperata-Borreria assemblage of the
   studied grassland. It was observed that B. pusilla (162.25 nos. m(-2)
   and 50.37 nos. m(-2)), I. cylindrica (318.75 nos. m(-2) and 304.18 nos.
   m(-2)) and Setaria glauca (24.70 nos. m(-2) and 16.46 nos. m(-2)) were
   benefited from burning as shown by the values sequentially placed for
   burnt and unburnt plots. Certain grasses like Chrysopogon aciculatus and
   Sacciolepis indica were restricted to burnt plot while Oxalis
   corniculata showed its presence to unburnt plot. Grasses dominated the
   grassland as revealed by their contribution to the mean percentage cover
   of 72\% in burnt plot and 76\% in unburnt plot. The dominance-diversity
   curves in the study site approaches a log normal series distribution
   suggesting that the resources are shared by the constituent species.
   Seasonal pattern in diversity index suggested definite influence of
   climatic seasonality on species diversity; rainy season was conducive
   for maximum diversity (1.40 and 1.38 in the burnt and unburnt plots,
   respectively). Dominance increased with concentration of fewer species
   (0.0021 in burnt plot and 0.0055 in unburnt plot) in summer and behaves
   inversely to index of diversity. This study showed that the traditional
   management practices benefits the farmers as it promote grassland
   regeneration with cylindrica as the dominant grass.}},

Abstract = {{Resource availability and biotic interactions control opportunities for
   the establishment and expansion of invasive species. Studies on biotic
   resistance to plant invasions have typically focused on competition and
   occasionally on herbivory, while resource-oriented studies have focused
   on water or nutrient pulses. Through synthesizing these approaches, we
   identify conditions that create invasion opportunities. In a nested
   fully factorial experiment, we examined how chronic alterations in water
   availability and rodent density influenced the density of invasive
   species in both the Mojave Desert and the Great Basin Desert after fire.
   We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and mediated
   effects controlling the density of invasives in both deserts. In the
   first 2 years after our controlled burn in the Great Basin, we observed
   that fire had a direct effect on increasing the invasive forb Halogeton
   glomeratus as well as a mediated effect through reducing rodent
   densities and herbivory. 4 years after the burn, the invasive annual
   grass Bromus tectorum was suppressing Halogeton glomeratus in mammal
   exclusion plots. There was a clear transition from years where invasives
   were controlled by disturbance and trophic interactions to years were
   resource availability and competition controlled invasive density.
   Similarly, in the Mojave Desert we observed a strong early influence of
   trophic processes on invasives, with Schismus arabicus benefitted by
   rodents and Bromus rubens negatively influenced by rodents. In the
   Mojave Desert, post-fire conditions became less important in controlling
   the abundance of invasives over time, while Bromus rubens was
   consistently benefitted by increases in fall rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Edge effects potentially have negative consequences for biodiversity in
   logging areas. In Tasmanian wet eucalypt forest, ground-dwelling beetle
   assemblages responded to habitat edges between mature unlogged forest
   and young regeneration following clearfelling. Transects of pitfall
   traps extended 100 m into unlogged forest and 10 m into the felled area
   firebreaks at four study sites (4 sites x 3 transects x 8 traps/transect
   = 96 traps). The depth of edge influence extended between 10 m and 25 m
   into mature forest, and the beetle assemblage was estimated to be 95\%
   similar to interior forest at approximately 22 m from the edge. The
   species composition of beetles changed gradually with distance from the
   edge, but for practical purposes we distinguished three zones of edge
   response: mature forest interior extending >= 22 m into unlogged forest,
   firebreak habitat at the edge of the coupe that extends 1 m into
   unlogged forest, and an edge-affected mature forest zone in between.
   Individual species known to be characteristic of mature and young forest
   were of greatest indicator value in mature forest interior and firebreak
   habitat, respectively. Choleva TFIC sp 01 (Leiodidae), Decilaus
   nigronotatus, D. lateralis and D. striatus (all Curculionidae) were
   identified as indicator species characteristic of mature forest
   interior. No species were found to be characteristic of the habitat
   edges.
   These results are relevant to current management practices in Tasmanian
   wet eucalypt forest, in particular to the efficacy of linear reserve
   networks. One hundred metre wide wildlife habitat strips, when bounded
   by recently harvested forest, are estimated to contain a little over
   50\% of interior habitat not compromised by edge effects. Small patches
   of forest (< 1 ha) retained in variable retention harvesting are
   predicted to contain little or no uncompromised interior habitat for
   ground-dwelling beetles. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{519-533}},

Abstract = {{In the Midwest, the oak savanna is a unique plant community located
   between the western prairies and northern forests, but, once the most
   common plant community in Wisconsin, it is now one of the region's
   rarest plant communities. To assess the success of varying intensities
   of management practices, standard dendrochronology and vegetation
   surveying methods were used to determine the age structure and species
   composition in oak savanna sites that varied from intensely managed to
   unmanaged. Size and age distributions revealed that the number of
   distinct cohorts of oaks increased in less managed sites. Seedlings and
   saplings were present in high frequencies in all sites; however,
   management practices such as fire applications that were too frequent
   apparently decreased oak survivorship, as did the competition in the
   closed canopies of the unmanaged sites. A fire frequency of 2-3 years
   eliminates competition, but a frequency of 4-6 years, typical of
   fire-adapted forest communities, allows for slower-growing species and
   younger oaks to survive, while still maintaining a low density. in these
   conditions, where growth rates vary in time, the use of dendrochronology
   is necessary to obtain an accurate canopy structure for fire-adapted
   forest communities. Quercus macrocarpa was dominant in the more managed
   sites, but shade-tolerant species were dominant in the unmanaged site.
   At present, the canopy composition in the managed sites represented an
   oak savanna assemblage; however, the unmanaged composition was shifting
   to a woodland assemblage. Thus, remnant oak savanna can be over- or
   under-managed, and unmanaged oak savanna can be overlooked as woodlands.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{I provide a synthesis of the papers in the Special Issue, The
   Conservation and Restoration of Old Growth in Frequent-fire Forests of
   the American West. These papers - the product of an Old Growth Writing
   Workshop, held at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona on
   18 - 19 April 2006 represent the ideas of 25 workshop participants who
   argue for a new attitude toward managing old growth in the frequent-fire
   forests of the American West. Unlike the lush, old-growth rainforests of
   the Pacific Northwest, the dry, frequent-fire forests of the western
   United States evolved with surface fires that disturbed the system with
   such regularity that young trees were almost always killed. When
   saplings did survive, they grew beyond the harm of frequent surface
   fires and, ultimately, attained the characteristics that define old
   growth in these systems. This system worked well, producing old-growth
   trees in abundance, until the onset of Euro-American settlement in the
   mid-to late-19(th) century. The arrival of these settlers put in motion
   an interplay of unprecedented social, political, economic, and
   ecological forces ( e. g., removal of Native Americans and their
   fire-based land management systems, overgrazing of the understory,
   aggressive logging, establishment of federal land management agencies,
   implementation of a federal fire suppression policy). These activities
   have culminated in 1) overly dense forested ecosystems that are now on
   the verge of collapse because of catastrophic fires ( i.e., crown fire
   at the landscape level; the Rodeo-Chediski Fire) and insect outbreaks,
   2) the emergence of conservation-minded environmental legislation and
   policy, and 3) greater levels of interaction between citizens, federal
   agencies, and fire-prone landscapes. Recognizing the tenuous ecological
   situation of these forests, restoration ecologists, foresters, and
   others have developed ways to return historic ecological processes and
   lower tree densities to these forests. However, their efforts are not
   without challenges, including working with communities and citizens,
   serving as a bridge between entrenched bureaucracies ( i.e., federal
   agencies and environmental groups), balancing both ecological and
   economic interests, and producing new applied technologies and
   science-based policy to advance conservation and restoration efforts
   aimed at preserving and developing old growth within a healthy forest
   environment.}},

   response during 2 years in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in

   by WSI 6-fold and by WSI and fire >7-fold over control stands (434-520
   kg/ha versus 69 kg/ha). The standing crop of preferred woody browse was
   greater than or equal to 20\% of total standing crop in all stands, and
   was increased by 4-9 times by WSI or WSI and fire. Wildlife stand
   improvement alone increased herbaceous plant production. Fire further
   enhanced forb and legume production but initially caused declines in
   panicum, low-preference woody, and total woody standing crop. Total
   standing crop was up to 6 times greater on WSI-treated stands than
   control treatments (988 vs. 159 kg/ha), and this response was related to
   stand basal area and time since burned. Management of stands for
   pine-bluestem renewal should be patterned after presettlement landscape
   conditions using growing and dormant season burns and a periodic burn
   interval versus set 3-year dormant season burns. We recommend retaining
   mature oak-pine stands on mesic sites for acorn production within a

Abstract = {{The first 2 years of post-burn vegetation succession of 11-13-year-old
   rehabilitated bauxite mines in Western Australia is compared to the
   native jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest using the techniques of
   ordination (CANOCO (TM)) and classification (TWINSPAN (TM)). Analyses of
   understorey species density and cover values showed consistent patterns
   of composition and abundance between the native jar;ah forest and the
   rehabilitated areas, both before and after burning. These patterns
   resulted from the intentional establishment of high densities of legume
   species in the initial rehabilitation process and proliferation of high
   densities of seeding species and non-native eucalypt seedlings following
   burning of the rehabilitated areas, features not characteristic of
   native jarrah forest. Burnt sites showed larger changes in species
   abundance and composition than unburnt control sites as indicated by
   their relative shift of position in the ordination hyper-space. This
   shift in position was generally less for sites burnt in spring than
   sites burnt in autumn. The first two divisions of the site
   classifications separated the unburnt sites and early spring post-burn
   sites from the forest and the remainder of the post-burn sites. The
   species classification showed that each of these groups was associated
   with a specific suite of species. Pit age (i.e. 11, 12 or 13 years-old
   at time of burning) was an important determinant of species composition
   in both the ordinations and classifications. Although species densities
   recovered more rapidly than live plant cover in the rehabilitated areas
   following burning, the vegetation of these rehabilitated sites exhibited
   little evidence of returning to their pre-tire species composition and
   abundance after 2 years. However, the high species similarity (75-79\%)
   between the pre-burn (including species only present as sled in the
   topsoil) and post-burn vegetation indicates the importance of the
   initial floristic composition in determining the potential direction of
   the post-fire succession. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Calluna vulgaris-dominated heathlands are globally important habitats

Abstract = {{1. This paper reviews and compares the effects of forest fire and timber
   harvest on mammalian abundance and diversity, throughout successional

   2. Temporal trends in mammal abundance and diversity are generally
   similar for both harvested and burned stands, with some differences
   occurring in the initiation stage (0-10 years post disturbance).
   3. Small mammals and ungulates are most abundant immediately post
   disturbance, and decrease as stands age. Lynxes and hares utilize
   mid-successional stands, but are rare in young and old stands. Bats,
   arboreal sciurids and mustelids increase in abundance with stand age,
   and are most abundant in old growth.
   4. Substantial gaps in the data exist for carnivores; the response of
   these species to fire and harvest requires research, as predator-prey
   interactions can affect mammal community structure in both early and
   late successional stages.
   5. The lack of explicit treatment of in-stand forest structure post
   disturbance, in the reviewed literature made comparisons difficult.
   Where forest structure was considered, the presence of downed woody
   material, live residual trees and standing dead wood were shown to
   facilitate convergence of mammal communities to a pre-disturbance state

   6. Mammalian assemblages differed considerably between successional

   management implications - A review}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{404}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystems are under increasing stress from environmental change,
   including invasion by non-native species that can disrupt ecological
   processes and functions. Chinese tallow {[}Triadica sebifera (L.) Small]
   is a highly invasive tree species in southeastern US forests, prairies,
   and wetlands, and effectively managing this invasive species is a
   significant challenge for scientists and land managers. In this review,
   we synthesize the literature on invasion ecology and management of
   Chinese tallow. Our review suggests that the invaded range of Chinese
   tallow is currently limited by dispersal in many areas and by low
   temperatures and low soil moisture, and by high soil salinity and
   frequent flooding in others, but these barriers may be overcome by
   increased dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, and/or rapid evolution.
   Invasions by Chinese tallow are facilitated by both the invasiveness of
   the species and the invasibility of the recipient communities.
   Invasiveness of Chinese tallow has been attributed to fast growth, high
   fecundity, a persistent seed bank, aggressive resprouting, abiotic
   stress tolerance, and the ability to transform fire maintained
   ecosystems. Some of these traits may be enhanced in invasive
   populations. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances, lack of herbivore
   pressure, and facilitation by soil microbes enhance the intensity of
   Chinese tallow invasions. Biological control of Chinese tallow is being
   developed. Treatments such as herbicides, prescribed fire, and
   mechanical control can effectively control Chinese tallow at the local
   scale. A combination of these treatments improves results. However, a
   proactive management approach would simultaneously achieve invasion
   control and promote subsequent ecological restoration, especially in the
   context of legacy effects, secondary invasions, and/or variable
   ecosystem responses to different control treatments. Future research
   should clarify the roles of species invasiveness and community
   invasibility, increase our understanding of the effects of Chinese
   tallow in invaded communities, and develop viable management regimes
   that are effective in both controlling or reducing the probability of
   Chinese tallow invasion and restoring desired native communities.}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Marshes in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain provide important winter
   habitats for many species of birds. Many of these marshes are managed
   intensively through a combination of fall/winter burning and
   construction of impoundments to improve wintering waterfowl habitat,
   reduce wetland loss, and create emergent wetlands. Little information is
   available on effects of this management on wintering birds, particularly
   passerines. We conducted experimental burns in impounded and unimpounded
   marshes on Rockefeller State Wildlife Refuge in southwest Louisiana and
   recorded species composition and abundance of birds during the 1996 and
   1997 winters. We found that burning and impoundment influenced
   vegetation structure, which in turn influenced bird abundance and
   species composition. Blackbirds (Icteridae) preferred recently burned
   plots. Sparrows (Emberizidae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) avoided recently
   burned plots but recolonized these plots after one year of vegetation
   recovery. Sparrows and wrens present in burned plots during the first
   winter following burning generally were observed in scattered patches of
   unburned vegetation. Suitability of Chenier Plain marshes as winter
   habitat for several bird species was reduced during the winter in which
   burning was conducted, particularly if a high proportion of the plot was
   burned. We recommend that patchy burns be used, at both the landscape
   level and within specific burned areas, to achieve management objectives
   and still provide suitable winter habitat for non-target species.
   Although many groups of birds depend on Chenier Plain marshes for winter
   habitat, these groups differ in their specific habitat requirements. We
   recommend that a diverse wetland complex (e.g., impoundments managed for
   waterfowl foraging habitat interspersed with those managed for passerine
   winter cover) be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Carabid diversity may provide remarkable indicators of habitat type. We
   tested how habitat affinities of ground beetles correspond to
   restoration success for black oak barrens previously assessed for
   understory flora. Three different restoration techniques were applied to
   set back succession of encroaching woodlands and to open the habitat:
   selective canopy tree removal favoring 5\% to 30\% tree canopy cover,
   removal of thick forest floor leaf litter, or prescribed fire. All
   methods were set within 35 x 35 m plots spread across 10 glacial kames,
   which are mounds of sand and gravel deposited by melting ice sheets.
   Baseline surveys using pitfall traps obtained 21 species of Carabidae,
   almost all of which were characterized as woodland species. Imposing
   disturbance increased species numbers to 28, with 11 newly discovered
   and four not found in the resurvey. Of the new inhabitants, four species
   known to use grasslands and one woodland edge species had become common,
   while numerous woodland species declined in abundance. This marked
   community change in Carabidae occurred primarily after select canopy
   tree removal, which was the treatment that best shifted the forest back
   to a mosaic of open oak sand barrens and grassland. Prescribed burns
   only increased one woodland edge species that also appeared after canopy
   thinning and leaf litter removal. Change in the carabid species
   indicated success in shifting habitat and, concurrently, shifting
   understory plants increased diversity of carabids towards species that
   may be lost should the region remain dominated by homogenous
   closed-canopy forest.}},

Abstract = {{Public lands provide many ecosystem services and support diverse plant
   and animal communities. In order to provide these benefits in the
   future, land managers and policy makers need information about future
   climate change and its potential effects. In particular, weather
   extremes are key drivers of wildfires, droughts, and false springs,
   which in turn can have large impacts on ecosystems. However, information
   on future changes in weather extremes on public lands is lacking. Our
   goal was to compare historical (1950-2005) and projected mid-century
   (2041-2070) changes in weather extremes (fire weather, spring droughts,
   and false springs) on public lands. This case study looked at the lands
   managed by the U.S. Forest Service across the conterminous United States
   including 501 ranger district units. We analyzed downscaled projections
   of daily records from 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 General
   Circulation Models for two climate scenarios, with either medium-low or
   high CO2- equivalent concentration (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). For each ranger
   district, we estimated: (1) fire potential, using the Keetch-Byram
   Drought Index; (2) frequency of spring droughts, using the Standardized
   Precipitation Index; and (3) frequency of false springs, using the
   extended Spring Indices. We found that future climates could
   substantially alter weather conditions across Forest Service lands.
   Under the two climate scenarios, increases in wildfire potential, spring
   droughts, and false springs were projected in 32-72\%, 28-29\%, and
   13-16\% of all ranger districts, respectively. Moreover, a substantial
   number of ranger districts (17-30\%), especially in the Southwestern,
   Pacific Southwest, and Rocky Mountain regions, were projected to see
   increases in more than one type of weather extreme, which may require
   special management attention. We suggest that future changes in weather
   extremes could threaten the ability of public lands to provide ecosystem
   services and ecological benefits to society. Overall, our results
   highlight the value of spatially-explicit weather projections to assess
   future changes in key weather extremes for land managers and policy

   fire intensity was recorded over forest cover (FC) and shrublands (SL),
   attributed to highly combustible tree crown fuel load characterised by
   leafy canopies and thin branches. In agreement, BA over FC was the
   highest in the USA and Australia, while Brazil was dominated by the
   burning of SL, characteristic of fire-tolerant Cerrado. The relatively
   lower BA over FC in Brazil can be attributed to fuel availability and
   proximity to highly flammable cover types such as cropland, SL and

Abstract = {{Over the last century, logging, land conversion, and fire suppression
   have reduced longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems to a small
   fraction of their original range. Fire suppression, in particular, has
   facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter

   combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide
   application. We designed this study to determine the effects of

   pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low-to
   high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009
   to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to
   vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were
   strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and
   canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands
   contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial-and bark-feeding cavity
   nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-,
   vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with
   several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea
   aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively
   correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter
   levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community
   makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management
   of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian
   abundance and species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Stand-replacing fires are part of the natural disturbance regime that
   maintain jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) forests of northern Lower
   Michigan. Currently, the occurrence and extent of wildfire is much
   reduced relative to the past and young jack pine plantations
   specifically managed for Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii Baird)
   are a prominent feature on the landscape. Stringers, or patches of
   residual prefire forest, are a unique feature left behind after
   wildfires which are not often accounted for in plantation management. In
   this study, we examined the ecological value of stringers from an avian
   biodiversity perspective by comparing bird assemblages found within
   stringers to those in the surrounding forest (non-stringers). Our
   objective was to answer two research questions: (I) do stringers have
   unique bird communities relative to the surrounding vegetation (forest
   or plantation)?; and (2) how much of the variation in bird communities
   can be explained by differences in vegetation structure and composition
   between stringers and non-stringers? We conducted breeding and
   non-breeding season point counts and used abundance data to compare bird
   species found within stringers and non-stringers at seven sites grouped
   by time since disturbance. Species richness was significantly higher (P
   = 0.01) in the stringers when the non-stringers were 30-40 years old,
   with 32 species discovered in the stringers and 29 species in the
   non-stringers. During the breeding season, bird assemblages differed
   between stringers and non-stringers when the non-stringers were <12
   years old (multi-response permutation procedures; T = -10.11, A = 0.07,
   P = <0.00), but no differences were observed when non-stringers were
   30-40 years old or >40 years old. Non-breeding bird communities differed
   between stringers and non-stringers only when the non-stringer was a
   recently planted (<5 years old) plantation (T = -2.15, A = 0.09, P =
   0.02). Differences in bird assemblages appear to be driven by the
   vegetation structure of stringers and non-stringers where fires were
   recent, but increasing similarity in vegetation structure occurs with
   time since fire; over time the importance of stringers for avian
   biodiversity is reduced. Our results suggest that stringers are
   important for bird communities, especially in recently disturbed areas,
   and that these biological legacies should be considered where jack pine
   management attempts to emulate natural patterns and processes. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We tested whether the intensity of hardwood midstory reduction causes
   commensurate improvements of herbaceous groundcover in fire-suppressed
   Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) sandhills. Using a complete randomized
   block design, we compared the effects of three hardwood reduction
   techniques (spring burning, application of the ULW(R) form of the
   herbicide hexazinone, chainsaw felling/girdling) and a no-treatment
   control on plant species richness, and on life form and common species
   densities at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, U.S.A., from 1995 to 1998.
   ULW(R) and felling/girdling plots were burned for fuel reduction two
   years after initial treatment application. We also sampled the same
   variables in frequently-burned reference sandhills to establish targets
   for restoration. Spring bums achieved partial topkill of oaks
   (17.6-41.1\% from 1995 to 1998) compared to reductions of 69.1-94\%
   accomplished by ULW(R) and of 93.2-67.8\% by felling/girdling
   treatments. We predicted that plant species richness and densities of
   herbaceous groundcover life forms would increase according to the
   percent hardwood reductions. Predictions were not supported by treatment
   effects for species richness because positive responses to fire best
   explained increases in plant richness, whereas ULW(R) effects accounted
   for the largest initial decreases. Legumes, non-legume forbs, and
   graminoids did not respond to treatments as predicted by the hypothesis.
   Again, positive responses to fire dominated the results, which was
   supported by greater herbaceous densities observed in reference plots.
   Overall, we found that the least effective and least expensive hardwood

   improvements as measured by species richness and herbaceous groundcover

Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{355-368}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the southwestern United
   States, used by 16 species of bats, are managed with thinning and
   prescribed fire to restore tree densities and fire regimes to conditions
   that existed prior to Euro-American settlement. Using 2 approaches
   (roosting and foraging) to categorize forest habitat for bats, we
   evaluated how restoration treatments may affect habitat use. We
   hypothesized that more foraging activity would occur in thinned stands
   because more species are adapted to open forest, but that more roosts
   would occur in unthinned stands where snags were unaffected by
   mechanical treatments and prescribed fire. During the summers of 2006
   and 2007, we used acoustic detectors to record call rates of bats as a
   measure of activity level and compared activity levels among stands that
   had undergone 3 thinning treatments (light, moderate, and heavy, with
   245, 172, or 142 trees per hectare postthinning, respectively) and an
   unthinned stand as a control (1201 trees per hectare). With
   radiotelemetry, we located roosts used by reproductive females of 2
   common species of forest-associated bats (long-eared myotis, Myotis
   evotis, and Arizona myotis, Myotis occultus) during summer 2007. We
   measured roost characteristics at 3 spatial scales (roost, microplot,
   and surrounding landscape) to contrast between roosts used by Myotis
   species and randomly selected comparison snags, microplots, and study
   area landscape. Among thinned and unthinned stands we did not detect a
   difference in activity levels for all bats (P = 0.2), nor a difference
   in call rates for Myotis spp. (P = 0.1). However, there was lower
   activity (P = 0.01) for non-Myotis bats in unthinned compared to thinned
   stands. This is probably because most non-Myotis species are better
   adapted to foraging in open forests. Of 24 roosts for long-eared myotis
   and Arizona myotis, only 31\% and 25\%, respectively, occurred in
   thinned stands. Bats selected large-diameter (> 68 cm diameter at breast
   height) ponderosa pine snags with exfoliating bark. Roosts for Arizona
   myotis were in areas with elements of old-growth structure, whereas
   roosts for long-eared myotis occurred in areas similar to stratified,
   midsuccessional, even-aged forest. Managing for large-diameter ponderosa
   pine snags and a variety of tree densities and age classes will provide
   roosting and foraging habitat for bats. We found no distinct ``best{''}
   treatment to recommend overall, likely because of species differences,
   with some bats better adapted to opencanopy and some to closed-canopy
   forest. Maintaining diverse habitat will support a diverse bat
   assemblage.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of habitat management practices at mid-rotation is needed for
   pine (Pinus spp.) plantations enrolled in cost-share programs.
   Plantations established in abandoned agricultural fields may have
   different understory plant communities than those with a long history of
   forest cover. Mid-rotation pine plantations often have a hardwood
   midstory that limits development of early succession habitat components
   important to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) and
   northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite). We treated with
   imazapyr herbicide and prescribed burning (HB) 11 thinned,
   13-22-year-old pine plantations in the Upper East Gulf Coastal Plain of
   Mississippi, USA, enrolled in cost-share programs, and we sampled plant
   community response during the summers of 2003 and 2004, years 1 and 2
   posttreatment. The HB treatment created a more open structure with
   greater coverage of debris and herbaceous plants than in controls.
   Increased forb coverage in HB plots yielded a more seasonally diverse
   foraging base for deer. Horizontal screening cover developed slowly in
   HB plots and was more abundant in control plots. Autumn and winter
   food-plant coverage for bobwhite was provided by either treatment, but
   accessibility was improved in HB plots relative to controls. Bobwhite
   nesting cover was improved by HB relative to controls but was still of
   marginal quality. Brood-rearing habitat was precluded in both treatments
   due to lack of bare ground. Our results indicate that imazapyr followed
   by prescribed fire is a beneficial tool for creating early succession
   habitat for deer and bobwhite in mid-rotation pine plantations with a
   history of agricultural use. Continued management with periodic
   prescribed fire and overstory thinning should be instituted to maintain
   and perhaps improve these conditions. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

Abstract = {{Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American
   habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland
   birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction
   of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes
   homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with
   early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines,
   especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an
   alternative grassland management practice known as patch-burning has
   been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by
   mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie
   before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of
   patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by
   early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels
   (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296
   dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed
   between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels
   tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean
   number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the
   treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures.
   Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in
   traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird
   (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in
   patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in
   patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive
   response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides
   further evidence that this practice can he a useful tool for grassland
   bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation,
   patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by
   providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels
   and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g.,
   trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects
   of grazing, which are not available under traditional management.
   Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy
   for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of forest management practices (prescribed

   forest Coleoptera in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North
   Carolina. During the 2-yr study, we captured 37,191 Coleoptera with
   baited multiple-funnel traps and pipe traps, comprising 20 families and
   122 species that were used for our analysis. Saproxylic beetle numbers
   increased greatly from the first year to the second year on all
   treatments. Species richness and total abundance of Coleoptera were not
   significantly affected by the treatments, but several families (e.g.,
   Elateridae, Cleridae, Trogositidae, Scolytidae) were significantly more
   abundant on treated plots. Abundances of many species, including various
   species of Scolytidae were significantly affected by the treatments.
   However, these scolytids (Hylastes salebrosus Eichoff, Ips grandicollis
   Eichoff, Xyloborinus saxeseni Ratzburg, Xyleborus sp., Xyleborus atratus
   Eichoff) did not respond in the same way to the treatments. Likewise,
   other Coleoptera such as Pityophagus sp. (Nitidulidae), Hylobius pales

   also varied in their responses to the treatments. Species richness was

   increased dead wood caused by hot fires on mechanical plus burn and burn
   only treatments resulted in increases among various Coleoptera families

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is increasingly recognised as a useful tool for
   biodiversity conservation in boreal forests. Most restoration methods in
   this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby
   promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research
   about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the
   responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We
   established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term
   effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap
   cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird
   assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory
   mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two
   restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth
   references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the
   two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total
   bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments.
   However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the
   bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional
   categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage),
   we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders,
   strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional
   habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and
   gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong
   cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and
   species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed
   burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any
   significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration
   through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of
   boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity
   excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should
   therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool
   to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural
   disturbances in boreal forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Prescribed fire in eucalypt woodlands: immediate effects on a microbat
   community of northern Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-76}},
Abstract = {{Context. Fire is a major ecological factor in many landscapes.
   Prescribed fires are often used in the management of vegetation for
   ecological values, wildlife habitat and reduction of risk of wildfire.
   However, debate continues over whether active fire management is
   beneficial to flora and fauna. Although bats comprise similar to 20\% of
   the world's extant mammal fauna, they have been largely ignored in
   studies investigating ecosystem response to fire, especially in
   Australia.
   Aims. In the present study, we aim to investigate the immediate
   responses of microbats to prescribed fires in a tropical eucalypt
   woodland.
   Methods. We used a replicated paired experimental design, consisting of
   burned and unburned treatment and control sites, to investigate how bat
   activity and community structure change following a prescribed fire.
   Key results. Total bat activity increased significantly following fire.
   Fire also resulted in changes in the bat species assemblage. Changes in
   community structure were driven by the following five species:
   Saccolaimus spp., Chalinolobus nigrogriseus, Chaerephon jobensis,
   Rhinolophus megaphyllus and unidentified Species c35. Activity of C.
   nigrogriseus, Saccolaimus spp., C. jobensis and Species c35 increased in
   the burned sites, whereas changes in the activity of R. megaphyllus were
   uncorrelated with the effects of fire.
   Conclusions. The effect of fire on these species is consistent with
   flight patterns and habitat use; species with higher wing aspect ratios,
   such as Saccolaimus spp., which are capable of fast flight but with
   limited manoeuvrability, became more active in the open conditions
   created by fire.
   Implications. The results of the present study suggest that prescribed
   fire as an environmental management tool may be beneficial to bats, at
   least in the short term, because it increases habitat suitability for a
   wider range of species.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of western forests have changed as a result of fire
   suppression and fuel reduction treatments have become a public land
   management priority. The effects of these treatments on wildlife
   habitat, however, have received limited attention. The fisher (Martes
   pennanti) is a species of concern in California and is vulnerable to
   fuels treatments due to its association with dense forests and use of
   large and old trees as resting sites. We evaluated the effect of fuels
   treatments by estimating predicted resting and foraging habitat at two
   sites in the Sierra Nevada that are part of the national Fire and Fire
   Surrogate Study. One site included three treatments (mechanical harvest,
   prescribed fire, and mechanical harvest plus prescribed fire) and the
   other included early and late-season prescribed fire; both sites
   included control treatments. We sampled vegetation before and after
   treatment application to estimate variables that were included in
   resource selection probability functions. Predicted resting habitat was
   significantly lower for mechanical plus fire treatments, but the control
   did not differ from the fire only or the mechanical only treatment.
   Late, but not early, season burns had significant impact on predicted
   resting habitat. Reductions in canopy cover affected predicted resting
   habitat directly. Fisher foraging habitat, unlike resting habitat was
   unaffected by treatments at either site. Within a stand, a number of
   management actions can mitigate the potentially negative short-term
   effects of fuels treatments on fisher habitat. Evaluating the effects of
   fuels management at the resting site, home range and landscape scales
   will be necessary to administer a treatment program that can address
   fuel accumulation while also restoring and maintaining fisher habitat.

Abstract = {{A population of eastern wild turkeys (Melagris gallopavo silvestris) was
   studied in the lower coastal plain of South Carolina to determine if
   intensively managed short-rotation pine plantations have a detrimental
   effect on reproductive success. Reproductive parameters including
   nesting chronology, nest success, hen success, clutch size, and
   hatchability were estimated from 50 radio-instrumented hens monitored
   during 1988-1990. Predation during nesting and brooding periods was the
   major cause of nest and adult hen losses (55\%). However, illegal kills
   were as high (45\%). Median dates for incubation initiation and hatching
   were 8 May and 3 June, respectively. Nest success (\% hatched greater
   than or equal to 1 egg) was 57.9\%. Proportion of hens in the population
   expected to produce poults was 50\%. Clutches averaged 9.8 eggs with
   82\% hatchability. Number of poults produced/hen averaged 4.0. Nest
   sites were located in all stand types in proportion to their
   availability. Stand age or basal area did not affect nest site
   selection. Most nests (61\%) occurred in stands controlled burned within
   2 years and 62\% of nests were located within 30 m of a road, trail or
   firebreak. Reproductive parameters were similar to values reported in
   other studies and did not indicate a negative effect from intensive
   forest management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a natural abiotic disturbance agent that is important in
   determining the vegetation patterns observed in many hardwood forests.
   Although natural fire was suppressed through much of the 20th century,
   in the late 20th century, fire was reintroduced into many ecosystems in
   the form of prescribed burning. The effects of fire on insect
   populations are not well understood. The objective of this study was to
   assess the effects of prescribed fire, tree species, and tree size on
   black carpenter ant abundance and distribution. The effects of
   prescribed fire, free species group, and tree dbh on black carpenter
   occurrence were studied using a presence-absence baited test on 3,556
   trees in the oak-hickory forests of the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas.
   Trees were distributed over unburned areas and areas burned in the
   dormant seasons of 2005, 2006, and 2007. Black carpenter ants occurred
   most frequently at baits on large red oaks and least frequently at baits
   on small hickories, suggesting that they preferentially forage on
   certain tree species and sizes. Occurrence of black carpenter ants
   varied by fire treatment. Habitat alterations are likely to be a cause
   of ant occurrence patterns in oak-hickory forests, but additional
   studies are necessary to understand the mechanism behind this trend.}},

Abstract = {{our study examined the short-term response of grassland invertebrate
   communities to fire in the South African Drakensberg, in relation to
   distance from the edge of a burn. We aimed to establish which species
   survive fire and the dynamics of the post-fire recolonization process,
   and thereby contribute to establishing the ideal area of a prescribed
   burn for invertebrate conservation. Four transects were sampled two and
   12 weeks after burning. Along each transect one unburnt control and four
   burnt sites were quantitatively sampled. Richness, abundance and
   diversity were calculated for each site and canonical correspondence
   analysis was applied to transect and morphospecies counts to determine
   the impact of distance from the edge of the burn on community structure.
   Distance from burn edge affected invertebrate richness and abundance,
   especially for flying insects. Burning appeared to minimally impact on
   wingless invertebrates, suggesting they tolerated fire by finding
   refuge. Invertebrate community structure changed with increasing
   distance from burn edge two weeks, but not 12 weeks post-burn. A
   distance of 280 m from burn edge appears to allow sufficient
   recolonization to maintain invertebrate diversity. Taxa found in the
   unburnt control and site closest to the edge in burnt grassland may be
   fire sensitive and require further study.}},

Title = {{Variable retention harvesting in Victoria's Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus
   regnans) forests (southeastern Australia)}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Variable retention harvesting is a silvicultural system that focuses on
   retaining key elements of stand structure at the time of logging and is
   increasingly being used worldwide. We describe the design and
   establishment of a variable retention harvesting experiment established
   in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central
   Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment was
   instigated in 2003, and the work to date has shown that it has
   environmental benefits for certain groups of small mammals, birds, and
   vascular plants. The experiment has been integrated with an ongoing
   long-term monitoring program as well as other experiments such as those
   in post-fire salvage-logged areas. Collectively, the results of various
   studies suggest that the potential value of variable retention
   harvesting extends beyond green-tree logging to post-fire salvage
   logging environments. We outline some of the challenges in, and new
   perspectives derived from, implementing and maintaining our experiment.
   This included difficulties protecting islands from high-intensity
   post-harvest regeneration burns and threat of declining funding
   undermining ongoing project viability. A critically important
   perspective concerns the ecological and economic context in which
   variable retention harvesting is implemented. In the particular case of
   Mountain Ash forests, assessments using formal IUCN criteria classify
   the ecosystem as being Critically Endangered under the Red Listed
   Ecosystem approach. As a result, Mountain Ash forests are at a high risk
   of ecosystem collapse. Further logging will increase that risk, making
   the basis for continued harvesting questionable. In addition, economic
   analyses suggest that the value of natural assets, like water
   production, far outweigh the value of the wood products harvested from
   the Mountain Ash ecosystem, again leading to questions about the
   viability of ongoing harvesting. We therefore conclude that whilst
   variable retention harvesting has the potential to contribute to
   biodiversity conservation in Mountain Ash forests, broader ecological
   and economic contextual issues (such as the values of competing
   resources like water yields and the heavily degraded state of the
   forest) may erode the case for its broader application.}},

Title = {{The effect of urban growth on landscape-scale restoration for a

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{105-115}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{A landscape-scale perspective on restoration ecology has been advocated,
   but few studies have informed restoration with landscape metrics or
   addressed broad-scale threats. Threats such as urban growth may affect
   restoration effectiveness in a landscape context. Here, we studied
   longleaf pine savanna in the rapidly urbanizing southeastern United
   States where a habitat-specialist bird, Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea
   aestivalis), is closely associated with savanna vegetation structure and
   frequent fire. Our objectives were to construct a species distribution
   model for Bachman's sparrow, determine the relationship between fire and
   urbanization, quantify the urban growth effect (2010-2090), identify
   potential restoration areas, and determine the interaction between
   restoration potential and urban growth by 2050. Number of patches, patch
   size, and isolation metrics were used to evaluate scenarios. The species
   distribution model was 88\% accurate and emphasized multiscale canopy
   cover characteristics, fire, and percent habitat. Fires were less common
   < 600 m from urban areas, and this fire suppression effect exacerbated
   urban growth effects. For restoration scenarios, canopy cover reduction
   by 30\% resulted in nearly double the amount of habitat compared to the
   prescribed fire scenario; canopy cover reduction resulted in larger
   patch sizes and less patch isolation compared to current conditions. The
   effect of urban growth on restoration scenarios was unequal.
   Seventy-four percent of restoration areas from the prescribed fire
   scenario overlapped with projected urban growth, whereas the canopy
   cover reduction scenario only overlapped by 9\%. We emphasize the
   benefits of simultaneously considering the effects of urban growth and
   landscape-scale restoration potential to promote a landscape with
   greater patch sizes and less isolation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Many studies predict effects of future climate scenarios on species
   distributions, but few predict impacts on landscapes or ecological
   communities, the scales most relevant to conservation management. We
   combined expert knowledge with community-level spatial modelling (using
   artificial neural networks, ANN, and generalised dissimilarity
   modelling, GDM) to inform climate adaptation management in widespread
   but highly threatened temperate grassy ecosystems (TGE) of Australian
   agricultural landscapes. GDM predicted high levels of `biotically-scaled
   environmental stress' (scaled in terms of potential change in species
   composition of communities) for plants, reptiles and snails within the
   TGE under medium, and especially high, 2070 climate scenarios. Predicted
   stress was lower for birds, mammals and frogs, possibly owing to
   generally wider species distributions, but these models do not account
   for changing habitat characteristics. ANN predicted environments within
   the current TGE biome will become increasingly favourable for formations
   such as chenopod shrublands, L. forests and Vent. forests by 2070,
   although classification error for eucalypt woodland in current climates
   was high. Expert knowledge and GDM suggest these predictions may be
   mediated by attributes such as environmental heterogeneity that confer
   resilience, but GDM confirms that widespread degradation has greatly
   compromised the capacity of TGE to adapt to change. Based on model
   predictions and expert knowledge we discuss five potential climate
   change outcomes for TGE: decreasing fire frequency, structural change,
   altered functional composition, exotic invasion, and cascading changes
   in ecological interactions. Although significant ecological change in
   TGE is likely, it is feasible to ameliorate non-climatic limits to
   adaptation and promote reassembly by native rather than exotic species.
   Current conservation efforts already target similar goals, and
   reinforcing and adjusting these approaches offer the highest priority,
   lowest risk climate adaptation options. We conclude that despite high
   uncertainties, combining community-level modelling with expert knowledge
   can guide climate adaptation management.}},

Abstract = {{South Texas is home to a high diversity of species due to its location
   at the confluence of subtropical, desert, and coastal ecoregions.
   Historical overgrazing of South Texas rangelands transformed the savanna
   and prairie to a landscape dominated by woody plants and shrubs
   interspersed with low seral grass species and bare ground. During the
   first half of the 20th century, exotic grass species, coupled with the
   application of industrial agricultural practices appeared to be the
   future of forage production in South Texas and elsewhere. Several of
   these exotic species, namely King Ranch bluestem {[}Bothriochloa
   ischaemum(L.) Keng], Kleberg bluestem {[}Dichanthium annulatum(Forssk.)
   Stapf], Angelton bluestem {[}Dichanthium aristatum(Poir.) C.E. Hubbard],

   maxima(Jacq.) R. Webster], Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis

   escaped pasture cultivation. Additionally, the native grass tanglehead
   {[}Heteropogon contortus(L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. \& Schult.] has begun
   displaying invasive behaviors. The monoculture growth habit of these
   species simplifies vegetation structure, reduces biodiversity, and
   decreases habitat for many species of wildlife. These grasses also alter
   natural fire regimes and nutrient cycling. This landscape-level
   transformation of vegetation composition and structure requires
   monitoring to quantify and assess the spatial and temporal distributions
   of invasive species as a basis to inform management practices. Current
   advances in remote sensing technologies, such as very high spatial
   resolution coupled with daily satellite imagery and unmanned aerial
   vehicles, are providing tools for invasive vegetation monitoring. We
   provide a synthesis of the natural history of these grasses, including
   their introductions, an overview of remote sensing applications in South
   Texas, and recommendations for future management practices.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the hydrogeology of Grand Canyon National Park
   (GRCA) in northern Arizona, USA, is critical for future resource
   protection. The similar to 750 springs in GRCA provide both perennial
   and seasonal flow to numerous desert streams, drinking water to wildlife
   and visitors in an otherwise arid environment, and habitat for rare,
   endemic and threatened species. Spring behavior and flow patterns
   represent local and regional patterns in aquifer recharge, reflect the
   geologic structure and stratigraphy, and are indicators of the overall
   biotic health of the canyon. These springs, however, are subject to
   pressures from water supply development, changes in recharge from forest
   fires and other land management activities, and potential contamination.
   Roaring Springs is the sole water supply for residents and visitors (> 6
   million/year), and all springs support valuable riparian habitats with
   very high species diversity. Most springs flow from the karstic
   Redwall-Muav aquifer and show seasonal patterns in flow and water
   chemistry indicative of variable aquifer porosities, including conduit
   flow. They have Ca/Mg-HCO3 dominated chemistry and trace elements
   consistent with nearby deep wells drilled into the Redwall-Muav aquifer.
   Tracer techniques and water-age dating indicate a wide range of
   residence times for many springs, supporting the concept of multiple
   porosities. A perched aquifer produces small springs which issue from
   the contacts between sandstone and shale units, with variable
   groundwater residence times. Stable isotope data suggest both an
   elevational and seasonal difference in recharge between North and South
   Rim springs. This review highlights the complex nature of the
   groundwater system.}},

   Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Context. Australia harbours an immense diversity of reptiles, which are
   generally expected to have frequent and diverse trophic interactions
   with introduced mammalian carnivores. Nevertheless, the potential for
   predatory or competitive interactions is likely to be contingent on
   multiple processes, including the importance of reptiles in the diet of
   introduced predators, alongside overlaps in their body sizes and
   ecological niches that would influence the strength of their
   interactions. In Australia's temperate and relatively productive mesic
   environments there is little understanding of how introduced mammalian
   predators affect reptile assemblages.
   Aims. The aim was to investigate the effects that a European red fox
   (Vulpes vulpes; 5-7 kg) suppression program had on the abundance and
   species richness of a reptile community, with species ranging in size
   from the largest local ectothermic predator, the lace monitor (Varanus
   varius; 4-7 kg), to small terrestrial reptiles (mostly 10-150 g).
   Methods. We utilised two sampling designs (baited camera monitoring
   stations and pitfall trapping) to evaluate the effects of fox
   suppression and other site-level ecological covariates (fire regime and
   habitat vegetation characteristics) on the lace monitor and small
   terrestrial reptiles. Reptile abundance and richness at site level were
   estimated from countrelated abundance models.
   Key results. For lace monitors, significantly higher abundances occurred
   in poison-baited areas relative to control areas. This suggests that fox
   suppression can affect the populations of the lace monitor via
   mesopredator release arising from reduced competition and, possibly,
   predation. For small terrestrial reptiles, neither abundance nor species
   richness were influenced by fox suppression. Individual abundances of
   the three most common small reptile species matched the overall pattern,
   as only responses to structural parameters of the habitat were detected.
   Conclusions. Fox suppression can have different impacts for different
   reptile taxa, pending their ecological niche, as only the largest
   species was affected.
   Implications. Increase in lace monitor abundance may change food web
   dynamics in fox-suppressed sites, such as by increasing predation
   pressure on arboreal marsupials.}},

Title = {{Fuel dynamics after a bark beetle outbreak impacts experimental fuel
   treatments}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fuel reduction treatments have been widely implemented
   across the western US in recent decades for both fire protection and
   restoration. Although research has demonstrated that combined thinning
   and burning effectively reduces crown fire potential in the few years
   immediately following treatment, little research has identified
   effectiveness of thinning and burning treatments beyond a decade.
   Furthermore, it is unclear how post-treatment disturbances such as a
   bark beetle outbreak affect fuel treatment effectiveness.
   Results: We evaluated differences in surface and canopy fuel
   characteristics and potential fire behavior metrics between fuel
   reduction treatments (no-action or control, burn-only, thin-only,
   thin+burn) implemented in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson \& C.
   Lawson)-Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}Mirb.] Franco)-dominated
   forests that were subsequently affected by a mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak after treatment. Experimental
   units were measured in 2002 (immediately following fuel treatment) and
   in 2016 (14 years after treatment and at least 4 years following a
   beetle outbreak). We found that beetle-altered thinning treatments
   (thin-only and thin +burn combined) had less fuel (i.e., 34\% and 83\%
   lower fine and coarse woody debris loading, respectively) and lower
   crown fire potential (i.e., 47\% lower probability of torching and 42\%
   greater crowning index) than corresponding unthinned treatments (control
   and burn-only). There was no post-beetle-outbreak effect of burning
   treatments (burn-only and thin+burn combined) on surface fuel loading,
   but burning reduced crown fire potential (i.e., 37\% greater crowning
   index) over unburned units (control and thin-only) 14 years after
   treatment. Additionally, we determined the relative impacts of fuel
   treatments and the bark beetle outbreak on fuel and crown fire potential
   differences and found that bark beetle-caused tree mortality inflated
   differences between controls and thinned treatments (thin-only and
   thin+burn) for surface fuel loading and probability of torching, but
   diminished differences between these treatments for canopy fuel loading,
   canopy bulk density, and crowning index.
   Conclusions: Despite the differential effects of bark beetle-caused tree
   mortality in the treatments, our study suggests that the effects of fuel
   treatments on mitigating crown fire potential persist even after a
   stand-transforming insect outbreak, especially when thinning and burning
   are combined.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris; LLP) ecosystem and
   its associated fauna is a principal goal of many land-management
   agencies in the southeastern United States. Prescribed fire and
   herbicide application are 2 common methods of LLP restoration. We
   employed a multi-scale approach to investigate how occurrence of fox
   squirrels (Sciurus niger) was influenced by fire frequency and herbicide
   application in LLP communities of northern Florida. We sampled 9-point,
   4-ha grids of camera traps with 106 grids in fire treatments, 23
   herbicide treatment grids, and 27 control grids. We evaluated a priori
   models for occurrence of fox squirrels at point, 4-ha patch, and
   home-range scales, and the influence of fire and herbicides on
   vegetation structure. Fox squirrel occurrence was positively associated
   with densities of turkey oak (Quercus laevis) at the patch scale, which
   were significantly less abundant in herbicide-treated areas. Fox
   squirrel occurrence was negatively correlated with fire interval and
   positively correlated with oak densities at a localized point scale.
   Additionally, fox squirrel point occurrences declined over time since
   the last fire. Fire produced habitat more favorable for fox squirrels
   than did herbicide treatments.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment conducted as part of the multidisciplinary National Fire
   and Fire Surrogate Study was designed to determine effects of three fuel
   reduction techniques on small mammals and habitat structure in the
   southern Appalachian mountains. Four experimental units, each > 14-ha
   were contained within each of three replicate blocks at the Green River
   Game Land, Polk County, NC. Treatments were (1) prescribed burning (B);
   (2) mechanical felling of shrubs and small trees (M); (3) mechanical
   felling + burning (MB); (4) controls (C). Mechanical understory felling
   treatments were conducted in winter 2001-2002, and prescribed burning
   was conducted in March 2003. After treatment, there were fewer live
   trees, more snags, and greater canopy openness in MB than in other
   treatments. Leaf litter depth was reduced by burning in both B and MB
   treatments, and tall shrub cover was reduced in all fuel reduction
   treatments compared to C. Coarse woody debris pieces and percent cover
   were similar among treatments and controls. We captured 990 individuals
   of eight rodent species a total of 2823 times. Because white-footed mice
   composed > 79\% of all captures, we focused on this species. Populations
   in experimental units increased 228\% on average between 2001 and 2002,
   but there was no evidence of an effect of the mechanical treatment. From
   2002 to 2003, all units again showed an average increase in relative
   population size, but increases were greater in MB than in the other
   treatments. Age structure and male to female ratio were not affected by
   the fuel reduction treatment. Average adult body weight declined from
   2001 to 2002, but less so in M than in units that remained C in both
   years. The proportion of mice captured near coarse woody debris was
   similar to the proportion captured in open areas for all treatments,
   indicating that white-footed mice did not use coarse woody debris
   preferentially or change their use patterns in response to fuel
   reduction treatments. Land managers should understand possible effects
   of different fuel reduction treatments on white-footed mouse
   populations, as they are an important component of the fauna and food

Abstract = {{Salvage logging following natural disturbances may alter the natural
   successional trajectories of biological communities by affecting the
   occurrences of species, functional groups and evolutionary lineages.
   However, few studies have examined whether dissimilarities between bird
   communities of salvaged and unsalvaged forests are more pronounced for
   rare species, functional groups and evolutionary lineages than for their
   more common counterparts.
   We compiled data on breeding bird assemblages from nine study areas in
   North America, Europe and Asia, covering a 17-year period following
   wildfire or windstorm disturbances and subsequent salvage logging. We
   tested whether dissimilarities based on non-shared species, functional
   groups and evolutionary lineages (a) decreased or increased over time
   and (b) the responses of rare, common and dominant species varied, by
   using a unified statistical framework based on Hill numbers and null
   models.
   We found that dissimilarities between bird communities caused by salvage
   logging persisted over time for rare, common and dominant species,
   evolutionary lineages and for rare functional groups. Dissimilarities of
   common and dominant functional groups increased 14 years post
   disturbance.
   Salvage logging led to significantly larger dissimilarities than
   expected by chance. Functional dissimilarities between salvaged and
   unsalvaged sites were lower compared to taxonomic and phylogenetic
   dissimilarities. In general, dissimilarities were highest for rare,
   followed by common and dominant species.
   Synthesis and applications. Our research demonstrates that salvage
   logging did not decrease dissimilarities of bird communities over time
   and taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dissimilarities persisted for
   over a decade. We recommend resource managers and decision makers to
   reserve portions of disturbed forest to enable unmanaged
   post-disturbance succession of bird communities, particularly to
   conserve rare species found in unsalvaged disturbed forests.}},

Abstract = {{In the semiarid areas of the Mediterranean basin, restoration activities
   during the XXth century have mainly relied on extensive plantations of
   Pinus halepensis, which now cover thousands of hectares. Here we review
   studies that have evaluated the effects of these plantations on soils,
   vegetation, faunal communities, and forest fires. The effects of R
   halepensis plantations on soil properties are highly dependent on the
   planting technique employed. Plantations frequently show enhanced runoff
   and soil losses when compared to natural shrublands, as well as limited
   improvement in most physio-chemical properties, which rarely reach the
   values shown by natural shrublands even 40 years after planting. The
   increase in tree cover resulting from the introduction of P. halepensis
   is commonly accompanied by an increase in water use, which may have
   relevant hydrological consequences at the catchment scale. Most studies
   performed so far have shown an overall negative effect of P. halepensis
   plantations on spontaneous vegetation. In these plantations, vegetation
   is dominated by early-successional species, and the establishment of
   late-successional sprouting shrubs-even after several decades-has been
   rarely reported. The effects of P. hatepensis plantations on faunal
   communities may vary depending on the animal group considered. Available
   studies suggest that P. halepensis plantations can reduce bird
   biodiversity and promote pest outbreaks. Our review contributes to the

Abstract = {{Considered a keystone species in the southeastern US coastal plain,
   gopher tortoises occupy a variety of upland habitat types. Although
   upland pine- dominated habitats have received much attention, few
   studies have examined tortoises in nearby coastal beach dune habitats.
   To examine the distribution and abundance of gopher tortoises in
   northeast Florida coastal habitats, comprehensive burrow surveys were
   conducted 3 times during the last 8 yrs on 2 separate gopher tortoise
   populations near St. Augustine, Florida. The objectives for these
   surveys were to 1) examine changes in population size and structure in
   representative upland and coastal dune habitats and 2) describe the
   response of gopher tortoises to land management practices (i.e.,
   prescribed fire). Total burrow density within the upland population
   remained stable over the 3 surveys (0.68 burrows/ha in 2005, 0.66
   burrows/ha in 2007, and 0.64 burrows/ha in 2011). Burrow densities in
   the burned areas of the upland habitat increased in areas that were
   burned at least once since the time of the first survey in 2005 but
   decreased in areas that were infrequently burned or remained unburned.
   Burrow density on the beach dunes, however, greatly increased between
   the most recent 2 surveys (3.63 burrows/ha in 2007 and 8.95 burrows/ha
   in 2011), possibly attributable to an increased use of a relatively
   confined habitat, or sampling biases by surveyors. Three different
   correction factor methods were used to determine gopher tortoise
   population estimates for each of the surveys, providing a range of
   estimates. The results of this study and the few others focused on
   coastal beach dunes suggest that this vulnerable, yet important, habitat
   should receive more attention because some of the highest gopher
   tortoise burrow densities have been observed there.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{410}},

Abstract = {{Historical fire regimes in the central United States maintained
   open-canopy shortleaf pine-oak woodlands on xeric sites. Following
   large-scale harvest and fire suppression, those woodlands grew denser
   with more continuous canopy cover, and they gained mesic species at the
   expense of shortleaf pine. There is high interest in restoring shortleaf
   pine-oak woodlands; most have been converted to other forest types but
   those that remain are valued for high stand-scale and landscape-scale
   diversity. Prior stand-scale studies suggest that prescribed burning and
   harvesting could be effective for restoring pine-oak woodlands. However,
   previous short-term, stand-scale studies provided little insight into
   long-term, landscape-scale outcomes. To estimate outcomes of alternative
   restoration treatments on future species composition and forest
   structure, we employed an integrated field and modeling approach to
   simulate effects of prescribed burning and harvesting on the restoration
   of shortleaf pine-oak woodland composition and structure in the Mark
   Twain National Forest for a 100-year period. Six scenarios were modeled:
   no management, burn only, harvest only, and a combination of harvest
   with burns treatments followed by fire-free intervals of differing
   starting times or durations to facilitate regeneration recruitment. Both
   no management and prescribed burn only scenarios cannot restore current
   forest to historical woodland condition (i.e., 40-80\% percent canopy
   cover or less than 55\% stocking); however, scenarios including harvest
   can restore current forest to woodland condition in late 2020s. Under a
   no management scenario, total basal area would increase to a maximum
   around 31 m(2) ha(-1), and white oak group remained the most dominant
   species group throughout the simulation. Under the burn only treatment,
   total basal area was not reduced substantially as compared to that under
   no management scenario, however, there were small increases in the basal
   area and density of shortleaf pine. All of the treatments that included
   a combination of burning and harvesting reduced total basal area, which
   fluctuated around 13 m(2) ha(-1) throughout the simulation than those
   under no management and prescribed only scenarios. The simulations
   suggested that shortleaf pine would become the most dominant group,
   followed by white, red oak groups, and other species with combined
   prescribed burning and harvesting. When coupled with harvest, the
   prescribed burning regime affected species composition: increasing the
   number of bums increased the basal area and density of shortleaf pine
   and decreased the basal area and density of white oak group species.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire poses risks to fish and wildlife habitat, among other things.
   Management projects to reduce the severity of wildfire effects by
   implementing hazardous fuel reduction treatments also pose risks. How
   can land managers determine which risk is greater? Comparison of risks
   and benefits from fuel treatment projects to risks from severe wildfire
   effects is consistent with policies requiring public land managers to
   analyze short- and long-term environmental effects. However, formulating
   the problem as a comparison of temporal considerations often results in
   decisions to reject fuels treatment projects near imperiled species
   habitat, even though the adverse effects of short-term project actions
   may result in substantial long-term net benefits from reducing the
   severity of wildfire effects. Consistent with widely accepted ecological
   risk assessment methods, the problem is formulated in a conceptual
   model. Salmonid fish populations are the risk assessment endpoint, and
   one stressor adversely affecting them is sediment from wildfire or
   logging. The model compares short-term effects of implementing fuels
   reduction treatments to longer-term wildfire effects with and without
   fuel treatments, including risk reduction benefits. Used quantitatively
   or qualitatively, the model may contribute to sustainable resource
   management decisions by improving communication among stakeholders, risk

Abstract = {{Understanding the link between environmental factors such as disturbance
   events, land cover, and soil productivity to spatial variation in animal
   abundance is fundamental to population ecology and wildlife management.
   The Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem is an archetypal
   fire-mediated ecosystem, which has seen drastic reductions in land area
   due to fire suppression. Current restoration utilizes prescribed fire
   and hardwood removal, but little is known regarding how these
   restoration efforts influence predator spatial distributions and
   predator-prey interactions. We conducted a study to investigate how
   fire, land cover, and soil productivity influence spatial distributions
   of predators in a fire-mediated ecosystem. We conducted a 34-camera
   survey across Camp Blanding Joint Training Center, a military
   installation in northern Florida, and utilized N-mixture models to
   estimate relative abundances of mammalian predators. To conceptualize
   our results relative to managed prey species, we categorized predators
   into white-tailed deer fawn predators {[}i.e. coyote (Canis latrans),
   bobcat (Fells rufus), and Florida black bear (Ursus americanus
   floridanus)] and nest predators {[}i.e. raccoon (Procyon lotor),
   Virginia opossum (Dideiphis virginiarta), and nine-banded armadillo
   (Dasypus noverncinctus)]. Coyote (P = < 0.001) and bobcat (P = 0.01),
   increased relative abundance with decreasing pyrodiversity, the number
   of unique time since fire values. Raccoon relative abundance increased
   with distance from recent burns (P = 0.02). Coyote (P = < 0.001) and
   bobcat (P = < 0.001) relative abundance also increased with proximity to
   hardwoods, while raccoon relative abundance decreased with proximity to
   pine (P = 0.02). Interestingly, there was a lack of detections of
   mesopredators {[}i.e. red fox (Vulpes Vulpes), grey fox (Urocyon
   cinereoargenteus), spotted skunk (Mephitis mephitis) and striped skunk
   (Spilogale putorius)] that were historically considered common
   throughout the Southeastern United States and longleaf pine ecosystems.
   Our results indicate that predator space use was altered by fire
   conditions and distances to pine and hardwood stands, which supports a
   predator management strategy that utilizes management tools commonly
   used in restoration and conservation of the LLP ecosystem to indirectly
   alter predator distributions, which has the potential to positively
   affect the management of important species within this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{More than 600,000ha of mine land have been reclaimed in the eastern

   of habitat management practices on resource selection. We used locations
   from 283 individuals during the breeding season (1 Apr-30 Sep) and 136
   coveys during the non-breeding season (1 Oct-Mar 31) from August 2009 to
   March 2014. Individuals were located closer to shrub cover than would be
   expected at random throughout the year. During the breeding season,
   individuals on treatment units used areas with smaller contagion index
   values (i.e., greater interspersion) compared with individuals on
   control units. During the non-breeding season, birds selected areas with
   greater shrub-open edge density compared with random. At the
   microhabitat scale, individuals selected areas with increased visual
   obstruction >1m aboveground. During the breeding season, birds were
   closer to disked areas (linear and non-linear) than would be expected at
   random. Individuals selected non-linear disked areas during winter but
   did not select linear disked areas (firebreaks) because they were
   planted to winter wheat each fall and lacked cover during the
   non-breeding season. Individuals also selected areas treated with
   herbicide to control sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) throughout
   the year. During the breeding season, bobwhites avoided areas burned
   during the previous dormant season. Habitat quality of reclaimed mine
   lands may be limited by a lack of shrub cover and extensive coverage of
   non-native herbaceous vegetation. Managers aiming to increase bobwhite
   abundance should focus on increasing interspersion of shrub cover, with
   no area >100m from shrub cover. We suggest disking and herbicide
   application to control invasive species and improve the structure and
   composition of vegetation for bobwhites. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis Nabokov)
   (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) is a federally listed, endangered species that
   has experienced dramatic decline over its historic range. In surviving
   populations, Karner blue butterflies have a facultative mutualism with
   ants that could be critically important to their survival where their
   populations are threatened by habitat loss or disturbance. In this
   study, we investigated the effects of ants, wild blue lupine population
   status (native or restored), and fire on adult Karner blue butterfly
   abundance at the Concord Pine Barrens, NH, USA. Ant frequency (the
   number of times we collected each ant species in our pitfall traps) was
   higher in restored than native lupine treatments regardless of burn
   status during both Karner blue butterfly broods, and the trend was
   statistically significant during the second brood. We observed a
   positive relationship between adult Karner blue butterfly abundance and
   ant frequency during the first brood, particularly on native lupine,
   regardless of burn treatment. During the second brood, adult Karner blue
   butterfly abundance and ant frequency were not significantly correlated
   in any treatments or their combinations. Our findings suggest that a
   combination of native and restored lupine is important for supporting
   both Karner blue butterflies and ants at the Concord Pine Barrens, and
   that burning does not affect the mutualism. Thus, scientists and
   managers at the site may wish to target their habitat management
   activities to best support both Karner blue butterflies and the
   particular ant species that provide the greatest benefit to their
   survival.}},

Abstract = {{Private landowners play a pivotal role in determining whether or not
   rare species persist in regions where privately owned land is extensive.
   The range of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is confined to
   the Southeastern U.S., a region predominantly under private ownership,
   and thus the status of this species is largely dependent upon land
   management decisions made by private landowners. We sent an anonymous
   mail survey to 2,584 individuals to examine factors affecting gopher
   tortoise occurrence on private lands in Mississippi (adjusted response
   rate of 23\%). Few respondents (19\%) reported currently having
   tortoises on their property, although many had them in the past (30\%).
   Tortoises were persisting primarily on larger properties with longleaf
   pine that were not managed chiefly for timber production. In general,
   respondents were largely unaware of habitat requirements of tortoises or
   effects of various land management practices on them, and few reported
   using management techniques that benefit tortoises, such as prescribed
   burning. Most respondents (57\%) knew of wildlife incentive programs,
   but were hesitant to enroll because they did not want to commit to
   managing their property in a particular manner (34\%). We suggest
   actions that could improve the likelihood of tortoise persistence in
   this region, as well as changes that could be made to incentive programs
   to increase landowner participation. These suggestions should be
   relevant to the conservation of other rare species on private lands in
   other regions.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the progress of ecological restoration projects is critical
   to improving our understanding of degraded ecosystems and their
   rehabilitation. In a remnant tallgrass prairie in southeast Michigan
   that is being managed by periodic dormant-season burns to reduce exotic
   species and increase native diversity, we tracked plant community
   changes in seven management units over a period of 16 y to evaluate
   ecological trajectory in the context of restoration goals. Factors that
   influenced compositional change from year to year were also assessed. We
   found that fire frequency, growing season temperature and growing season
   precipitation were correlated with the magnitude of year-to-year
   compositional change. Over the 16 y period, most management units
   decreased sharply in exotic species richness and abundance but did not
   increase appreciably in native species richness. Also, species evenness
   and native species abundance increased while total species richness
   decreased in most units. Over both spatial and temporal scales, the
   native C-4 grass Andropogon gerardii (big bluestem) was negatively
   correlated with species richness, likely because of competitive pressure
   from A. gerardii. Moreover, the direction of ecological trajectory,
   which diverged among management units over time, was related to
   differences in the abundance of A. gerardii across the prairie.
   Ultimately, we concluded that although frequent fire was effective at
   maintaining prairie species and reducing exotic species, using fire as
   the only restoration tool was not effective at achieving a
   species-diverse prairie community.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean landscapes comprise a complex mosaic of different habitats
   that vary in the diversity of their floral communities, pollinator
   communities and pollination services. Using the Greek Island of Lesvos
   as a model system, we assess the biodiversity value of six common
   habitats and measure ecosystemic `health' using pollen grain deposition
   in three core flowering plants as a measure of pollination services.
   Three fire-driven habitats were assessed: freshly burnt areas, fully
   regenerated pine forests and intermediate age scrub; in addition we
   examined oak woodlands, actively managed olive groves and groves that
   had been abandoned from agriculture. Oak woodlands, pine forests and
   managed olive groves had the highest diversity of bees. The habitat
   characteristics responsible for structuring bee communities were: floral
   diversity, floral abundance, nectar energy availability and the variety
   of nectar resources present. Pollination services in two of our plant
   species, which were pollinated by a limited sub-set of the pollinator
   community, indicated that pollination levels were highest in the burnt
   and mature pine habitats. The third species, which was open to all
   flower visitors, indicated that oak woodlands had the highest levels of
   pollination from generalist species. Pollination was always more
   effective in managed olive groves than in abandoned groves. However, the
   two most common species of bee, the honeybee and a bumblebee, were not
   the primary pollinators within these habitats. We conclude that the
   three habitats of greatest overall value for plant-pollinator
   communities and provision of the healthiest pollination services are
   pine forests, oak woodland and managed olive groves. We indicate how the
   highest value habitats may be maintained in a complex landscape to
   safeguard and enhance pollination function within these habitats and
   potentially in adjoining agricultural areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{564-571}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae {[}L.] Nevski) is an exotic
   annual grass invading western rangelands. Invasion by medusahead is
   problematic because it decreases livestock forage production, degrades
   wildlife habitat, reduces biodiversity, and increases fire frequency.
   Revegetation of medusahead-invaded sagebrush steppe is needed to
   increase ecosystem and economic productivity. Most efforts to revegetate
   medusahead-infested plant communities are unsuccessful because perennial
   bunchgrasses rarely establish after medusahead control. The effects of
   prescribed burning (spring or fall), fall imazapic application, and
   their combinations were evaluated for medusahead control and the
   establishment of seeded large perennial bunchgrasses. One growing season
   after treatments were applied, desert wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum
   {[}Fisch. ex Link] Schult.) and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides {[}Raf.]
   Swezey) were drill seeded into treatment plots, except for the control
   treatment. Vegetation characteristics were measured for 2 yr postseeding
   (second and third year post-treatment). Medusahead was best controlled
   when prescribed burned and then treated with imazapic (P < 0.05). These
   treatments also had greater large perennial bunchgrass cover and density
   compared to other treatments (P < 0.05). The prescribed burned followed
   by imazapic application had greater than 10- and 8-fold more perennial
   bunchgrass cover and density than the control treatment, respectively.
   Prescribed burning, regardless of season, was not effective at
   controlling medusahead or promoting establishment of perennial
   bunchgrasses. The results of this study question the long-term
   effectiveness of using imazapic in revegetation efforts of
   medusahead-infested sagebrush steppe without first prescribed burning
   the infestation. Effective control of medusahead appears to be needed
   for establishment of seeded perennial bunchgrasses. The results of this
   study demonstrate that seeding desert wheatgrass and squirreltail can
   successfully revegetate rangeland infested with medusahead when
   medusahead has been controlled with prescribed fire followed by fall
   application of imazapic.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire salvage logging is widely implemented worldwide, but there is
   an increasing concern about its potential impact on the ecosystem.
   Moreover, there is scant information about the effect of salvage logging
   on ecosystem processes mediated by species interactions. We manipulated
   a burnt pine forest to experimentally analyze the effect of burnt-wood
   management on the colonization of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) mediated by
   acorn dispersal by Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius). Three replicates
   of three treatments were established in an 18-ha plot: salvage logging
   (SL), non-intervention (NI), and partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling
   and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass in situ). We
   hypothesized that different burnt-wood management could alter jays'
   landscape perception and thus the pattern of seed dispersal and seedling
   recruitment. We monitored jay abundance in each treatment for three
   winters and three breeding periods, and jay flights of potential acorn
   dispersal between nearby oak trees and the treatments. We also searched
   for oak seedlings recruited in the experimental plot for five years
   following the fire. Jays were recorded significantly more times (87\%)
   in NI, and movements to this treatment during the acorn dispersal period
   were also more frequent (81\% of the flights). Oak seedlings were also
   more abundant in NI (ca. 55\%) than in SL or PCL (ca. 25\% each),
   despite a strong effect of small remnants of live pines. The results
   show that the burnt forest, if unsalvaged, still provides a suitable
   habitat for jays, while salvage logging reduces the strength of this key
   plant-animal interaction for oak natural regeneration. Nonintervention
   policies after a forest fire therefore provide the opportunity for
   adaptive management that helps reduce restoration costs and increase the
   resilience of the system.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},

Volume = {{401}},
Pages = {{134-143}},

Abstract = {{Although the famous competition exclusion principle was thoroughly
   elaborated in the framework of multispecies population models, its
   illustrations with field data were facing certain obstacles. The data we
   deal with were collected by 6 consecutive examinations of bilberry
   (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (V. vitis-idaea) presence/absence in
   20 x 20 cm quadrats located along permanent transects in a Scots pine
   boreal forest. These data feature a great sample size (2000 quadrats x 6
   examinations) and a 5-year interval for each pair of
   examination/re-examination, and the data have enabled us to construct a
   Markov chain model for the fine-scale dynamics of these dominant species
   at the later stages of post-fire succession. The discrete-time
   nonautonomous model consists of the five time-dependent, one-step
   transition matrices that describe changes occurring in the quadrat
   status for the 5 years in the following 4 terms: species-free quadrat;
   bilberry alone, cowberry alone, both species. Calibrated on the data,
   each one-step transition matrix transforms the current distribution of
   quadrats among their statuses exactly to the next one observed and
   yields a steady-state distribution as its (time-specific) positive
   eigenvector. Step-by-step variations in the elements of transition
   matrices do affect the components of the corresponding eigenvectors, but
   do not change the dominance relationships among them.
   Calculated as the 5-th power matrix root from the product of those five
   transition matrices (in the chronological order within their product),
   the geometric average, treated again as a transition matrix, provides
   for the spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed dynamics
   summarizing the whole observation period. We reveal the expected
   terminal stable outcome of species dynamics to be a distribution where
   37\% of quadrats are occupied by the bilberry alone, 11\% by cowberry
   alone, 38\% by the both species, and 14\% be species-free. It is shown
   for the first time that the share of cowberry-alone quadrats decreases
   notably in the course of succession, whereas the share of species
   coexistence quadrats increase.
   The averaged characteristics of cyclicity and status duration in the
   fine-scale dynamics enable us to estimate the total time of the
   secondary post-fire succession as 46-50 years (till reaching a
   distribution close to the terminal one). Of the four statuses
   considered, the cowberry-alone quadrats have the least mean duration
   time (9 years), while the bilberry-and-cowberry quadrats have the
   longest time (18 years), which are explainable by different life spans
   of the shoots in proper species.}},

   (none, October, and March) at three sites and monitored understory woody
   response from 2008 to 2016. In combination, thinning and burning had
   strong negative effects on some mesophytic species (Pious strobus,
   Ostrya virginiana, and Fagus grandifolia) and positively affected many
   shade-intolerant and fire-tolerant species formerly suppressed under
   closed canopies. Such compositional shifts were greatest at our most
   xeric site, and were related to treatment effects on overstory and
   midstory density. Seedling density of Quercus spp. nearly doubled
   (+2,256 stems ha-1()) from pre- to postmanagement. Sapling response was
   less dramatic; however, indicator and ordination analyses often
   associated mesophytic and disturbance-dependent saplings with unmanaged
   and managed treatments, respectively. Fire-season effects were subtle,
   but more species and greater understory densities were associated with
   March relative to October burning. Although some mesophytic species

Abstract = {{Among the most pressing concerns of land managers in post-wildfire
   landscapes are the establishment and spread of invasive species. Land
   managers need accurate maps of invasive species cover for targeted

   methodology based on limited invasive species occurrence data, freely
   available remotely sensed data, and open source software to predict the
   distribution of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) in a post-wildfire
   landscape. We developed four species distribution models using eight
   spectral indices derived from five months of Landsat 8 Operational Land
   Imager (OLI) data in 2014. These months corresponded to both cheatgrass
   growing period and time of field data collection in the study area. The
   four models were improved using an iterative approach in which a
   threshold for cover was established, and all models had high sensitivity
   values when tested on an independent dataset. We also quantified the
   area at highest risk for invasion in future seasons given 2014
   distribution, topographic covariates, and seed dispersal limitations.

   factorial treatment arrangement and four replications of each treatment.
   Treatments were combinations of thinning to three residual basal areas
   (no thin, light thin to 17.2 m(2) ha(-1), heavy thin to 11.5 m(2)
   ha(-1)) and three prescribed burn applications (no burn, one burn to be
   repeated every 9 years, three burns repeated every 3 years). Burning
   without thinning altered stand structure by reducing overstory stem
   density by 15 \%, whereas thinning without burning reduced density by 70
   \% and burning coupled with thinning resulted in reduced overstory trees
   by 72 \%. Frequent fire had the greatest impact on midstory structure
   and regeneration. Midstory stem density was reduced by 90 \% following
   thinning and burning. Oaks (Quercus L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.)
   were the most common understory species after thinning only, burning
   only, and thinning combined with burning. There were more oak and red
   maple seedling sprouts following frequent burning. Currently, > 75 \% of
   red maple sprouts dominate the regeneration, compared to only 40 \% of
   the oaks. Although the treatments have accelerated the transition toward
   hardwood-pine mixedwoods, the fate of oak and which hardwood species
   will be dominant in the future remains uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment by fencing of semi-arid trees is a common woodland
   conservation strategy that may have both positive and negative
   implications. Domestic herbivores can act as efficient dispersal seed
   agents but they can also affect the survival and growth of the trees
   first stages. Prosopis flexuosa (algarrobo) woodlands represent the most
   important plant community in the Monte region in Argentina and as this
   resource is affected by deforestation, grazing, natural fires and
   replacement of natural ecosystems by croplands, in order to protect the
   ``algarrobo{''} a reserve had been established. As efficient management
   and conservation program depends on the information on population
   structure and mating system, the objectives of this work were to
   estimate mating and pollen dispersal patterns in a wild P. flexuosa
   population from the Nacunan fenced to exclude domestic cattle for 40
   years. This population is mainly outcrosser (tm = 0.996), sensitive to
   inbreeding depression at seed stage, having relative reduced pollen
   mediated gene dispersal distance (4.56-20.35 m), which favors inbreeding
   as a consequence of mating between related individuals. Our results
   suggest that for ex situ conservation the distance that would be enough
   to avoid full sib sampling among harvested seed-trees is about 20 m.
   Collecting seeds from different pods reduce the proportion of full sibs
   within progeny arrays. For in situ conservation it is important to take
   into account that forest patches separated by more than 250 m are
   expected to be isolated, increasing the risk of genetic variability
   loss, inbreeding increase and population extinction. The results are
   discussed in reference to the ``algarrobo{''} management program; while
   in some case excluding big mammals from the stands should be advisable,
   the interaction with long dispersal big herbivores might be considered
   as a strategy to promote increased outbreeding, reducing the rate of
   mating between related individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wildfires play a major role in driving vegetation changes and can cause
   important environmental and economic losses in Mediterranean forests,
   especially where the dominant species lacks efficient postfire
   regeneration mechanisms. In these areas, postdisturbance vegetation
   management strategies need to be based on detailed, spatially continuous
   inventories of the burned area. Here, we present a methodology in which
   we combine airborne LiDAR and multispectral imagery to assess postfire
   regeneration types in a spatially continuous way, using a Mediterranean
   black pine (Pinus nigra Arn ssp. salzmannii) forest that burned in 1998
   as a case study. Five postfire regeneration types were obtained by
   clustering field-plot data using Ward's method. Two of the five
   regeneration types presented high tree cover (one clearly dominated by
   hardwoods and the other dominated by pines), a third type presented low
   to moderate tree cover, being dominated by hardwoods, and the remaining
   two types matched to areas dominated by soil-herbaceous or shrub layers
   with very low or no tree cover (i.e., very low to no tree species
   regeneration). These five types of regeneration were used to conduct a
   supervised classification of remote sensing data using a nonparametric
   supervised classification technique. Compared with independent field
   validation points, the remote sensing based assessment method resulted
   in a global classification accuracy of 82.7\%. Proportions of
   regeneration types in the study area indicated a general shift from the
   former pine-dominated forest toward hardwood dominance and showed no
   serious problems of regeneration failure. Our methodological approach
   appears to be appropriate for informing postdisturbance vegetation
   management strategies over large areas.}},

   understory plant community characteristics in the Populus forests in and
   around Elk Island National Park, Alberta, under different disturbance
   regimes. Vegetation from 36 sites, stratified by four topographic
   positions and three historical treatment combinations of fire and native
   ungulate herbivory, were sampled. In these sites, we quantified tree
   density, basal area and cover, understory species richness and
   diversity, shrub density and height, as well as grass, forb, and browse
   annual net primary production (ANPP). Although tree canopy
   characteristics were similar under all three disturbances,
   small-diameter trees (<5 cm) were nearly absent within the Park. The
   reference area outside the Park had greater browse-leaf and -twig ANPP,
   as well as shrub height, but lower grass ANPP. Inside the Park, burned
   areas had greater shrub density and ANPP of grass and forb components.
   Topographically, tree stand basal area, cover, and shrub height were
   greatest on the northern slope, as was browse-leaf ANPP. Species
   diversity and richness were relatively greater on the toe slope. Within
   the plant community variables examined, the disturbances and positions
   frequently interacted, particularly the burned treatment with the crest
   position and level of herbivory with the south-facing and north-facing
   slopes. The structure, composition, and ANPP of Populus forest in Elk
   Island National Park has been significantly affected by both ungulate

Abstract = {{Contemporary fire patterns are considered the most likely cause for
   regional population decline amongst small to medium mammals in northern
   tropical Australia. Here we assess the extinction risk faced by a
   vulnerable north Australian native rodent, the Brush-tailed Rabbit-rat
   Conilurus penicillatus in relation to fire frequency. This species has
   recently suffered a significant contraction in range. We provide the
   first quantitative evidence to demonstrate the immediate threat
   destructive wildfires and regular annual fire pose to the long-term
   population persistence of C. penicillatus. We show that late-dry season
   fires cause a reduction in both juvenile and adult survival
   probabilities. However, abundance declined at the unburnt as well as a
   frequently burnt site, suggesting that fire exclusion alone does not
   guarantee the species' long-term persistence. Our model projections
   indicate that the remaining populations of C. penicillatus on the
   Northern Territory mainland risk extirpation within the next ten years.
   Conservation requires decisive management action to ameliorate extensive
   and destructive fires. A multi-faceted management plan needs to focus on
   restoring a fire management regime which generates a fine-scale mosaic

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Acequias are historical community-operated water channels used for
   irrigating of traditional farming areas (vegas). They have been
   traditionally managed by local inhabitants, either by clearing weeds or
   by burning them in winter, in order to keep the channels clean of
   vegetation, thus avoiding their clogging. The impact of these cultural
   practices on vegetation has not still been studied. The aim of this
   paper is to show how traditional management influences floristic
   biodiversity in a traditional acequia in the vega of Granada (SE Spain).
   The acequia was treated following the traditional methodology used by
   farmers, being divided into areas that were burned, cleared, or left
   unchanged as control (January 2016). Afterwards, we collected soil
   samples and analyzed them in the lab to determine the treatment effects
   on soil properties. Vegetation was monitored in late spring 2016 in
   order to detect differences between treatments. Traditional management
   increased plant diversity, this effect being much more patent for the
   burning than for clearing treatment. Soil analyses revealed only slight
   differences in pH and CaCO3 content, higher for the burning treatment.
   The increase in plant diversity found in areas treated by traditional
   management was due mainly to the reduction of competition, which
   promoted the emergence or increase of populations of non-dominant
   species. The results indicated that traditional management not only
   offers advantages to the farmers but also promotes plant diversity and
   ecosystem services.}},

Volume = {{181}},

Abstract = {{A primary challenge in conservation biology is to preserve the most
   representative biodiversity while simultaneously optimizing the efforts
   associated with conservation. In Europe, the implementation of the
   Natura 2000 network requires protocols to recognize and map threats to
   biodiversity and to identify specific mitigation actions.
   We propose a systematic conservation planning approach to optimize
   management actions against specific threats based on two fundamental
   parameters: biodiversity values and threat pressure. We used the
   conservation planning software Marian to optimize a fire management plan
   in a Natura 2000 coastal network in southern Italy. We address three
   primary questions: i) Which areas are at high fire risk? ii) Which areas
   are the most valuable for threatened biodiversity? iii) Which areas
   should receive priority risk-mitigation actions for the optimal effect?,
   iv) which fire-prevention actions are feasible in the management areas?.
   The biodiversity values for the Natura 2000 spatial units were derived
   from the distribution maps of 18 habitats and 89 vertebrate species of
   concern in Europe (Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC). The threat pressure
   map, defined as fire probability, was obtained from digital layers of
   fire risk and of fire frequency. Marxan settings were defined as
   follows: a) planning units of 40 x 40 m, b) conservation features
   defined as all habitats and vertebrate species of European concern
   occurring in the study area, c) conservation targets defined according
   with fire sensitivity and extinction risk of conservation features, and
   d) costs determined as the complement of fire probabilities.
   We identified 23 management areas in which to concentrate efforts for
   the optimal reduction of fire induced effects. Because traditional fire
   prevention is not feasible for most of policy habitats included in the
   management areas, alternative prevention practices were identified that
   allows the conservation of the vegetation structure.
   The proposed approach has potential applications for multiple
   landscapes, threats and spatial scales and could be extended to other
   valuable natural areas, including protected areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Based on the data of six repeated observations in a Polytrichum-type
   Scots pine forest, a non-autonomous Markov model is constructed for the
   fine-scale dynamics of two dominant species (Vaccinium myrtillus and V.
   vitis-idaea) at the late stages of post-fire succession. The model
   consists of five transition matrices depending on the year of
   observation, while their average matrix results in a homogeneous model.
   The experiment design features a large sample size (2000 quadrats x 6
   observations) on permanent transects, a 5-year re-examination interval,
   and the use of species rooted frequency on the 20 x 20 cm quadrats
   during 25 years.
   As a model of how the species change each other on the quadrats, the
   discrete Markov chain has the following four states: both species being
   absent on the quadrat, one of them being present alone, and the joint
   presence of the both; the model time step coincides with the interval
   between counts. The data enable us to uniquely calibrate the transition
   matrix for each pair of successive observations and to obtain, by the
   formulae of finite Markov chain theory, the vectors of steady-state
   square distributions for each of the five temporal transitions.
   We have shown that fluctuations in the species rooted frequency between
   observations do affect the value of certain entries to the transition
   matrices, hence of the corresponding (to the particular pair of
   observations) steady-state vector components, but do not change
   principally the conclusion on the dominating states of the quadrats.
   The geometric mean of five transition matrices provides for spatial and
   temporal characteristics of the process over the whole observation
   period. We have shown that the stable terminal outcome of species
   dynamics is expected to be the distribution of quadrats among the states
   such that 37\% of the sites will be occupied only by V myrtillus alone,
   11\% by V vitis-idaea alone, both species will be present on 38\% of the
   quadrats, and 14\% of quadrats will be ``empty{''}. It is shown for the
   first time that the share of V. vitis-idaea alone quadrats decreases
   markedly in the course of succession, but increases the share of
   quadrats where both species grow together.
   The average characteristics of cyclicity and stage duration in the
   fine-scale dynamics enable us to estimate the total duration of
   secondary post-fire succession at 46-50 years (with reaching a state
   close to the terminal one). Of the four states described, the V
   vitis-idaea alone quadrats have the smallest average lifetime (9 years)
   and the V. myrtillus + V. vitis-idaea quadrats have the largest (18
   years), which is partly explained by the different lifetimes of shoots
   in the corresponding species.}},

Abstract = {{The relative benefit of different grazing management practices for

   considered were grazing system, stocking rate, animal type, grazing
   season, fire-grazing interaction, plus burning regime. Sparse empirical
   data indicated that stocking rate, cattle-to-sheep ratio, and increased
   fire intervals can affect plant diversity. Certain species behave as
   increaser or decreaser species in response to stocking rate or
   cattle-to-sheep ratio. Plant diversity appears robust in the face of
   variation in fire regime except for preclusion of fire. Multicriteria
   analysis was used to assess the relative impact of grazing systems
   (continuous, conventional, or high-intensity grazing by sheep, cattle,
   or sheep plus cattle) on grassland biodiversity integrity. Selected
   indicators covered landscape composition, structure and functioning.
   High-intensity systems and continuous sheep grazing have the most, and
   continuous grazing with beef the least, negative impact, depending on
   stocking rate. The relation between veld condition and plant diversity
   needs to be tested further before veld condition is used as a management

Abstract = {{Understanding the cumulative effects and resource trade-offs associated
   with forest management requires the ability to predict, analyze, and

   a spatially explicit landscape simulation model, LANDIS, and compared
   the outcomes of seven forest management alternatives including intensive
   and extensive even-aged and uneven-aged management, singly and in
   combination, as well as no harvest. We also simulated concomitant
   effects of wildfire and windthrow. We compared outcomes in terms of
   spatial patterns of forest vegetation by age/size class, edge density,
   core area, volume of coarse wood debris, timber harvest, standing crop,
   and tree species composition over a 200-year simulation horizon. We also

   that harvested 5\% of the landscape per decade; this suggests that gap
   phase replacement of senescent trees in combination with wind and fire
   disturbance may produce a disturbance regime similar to that associated
   with a 200-year timber rotation. Greater harvest levels (10\% per
   decade) resulted in more uniform structure of small or large patches,
   for uneven- or even-aged management, respectively, than lesser levels of
   harvest (5\% or no harvest); apparently reducing the effects of natural
   disturbances. Consequently, the even-aged management at the 10\% level
   had the greatest core area and least amount of edge. Habitat suitability
   was greater, on average, for species dependent on characteristics of
   mature forests (ovenbird, gray squirrel) than those dependent on
   disturbance (prairie warbler, hooded warbler) and habitat suitability
   for disturbance dependent species was more sensitive to the management
   alternatives. The approach was data-rich and provided opportunities to
   contrast the large-scale, long-term consequences for management
   practices from many different perspectives. Crown Copyright (c) 2006

Abstract = {{To examine the impact of human disturbance on mammalian community in a
   human-disturbed tropical landscape in Borneo, we conducted a baited
   camera trapping study in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, from 2005 to 2010.
   Along a gradient of habitat degradation, we established four camera
   trapping sites within a 20-km radius, one in Sungai Wain Protection
   Forest and three in Bukit Soeharto Grand Forest Park. From the camera
   trapping carried out for 1,017 camera-days, we obtained 3,753 images of
   29 mammal species, including an alien species, the domestic dog (Canis
   lupus familiaris). The trapping efficiency and species composition of
   mammals recorded differed between the two kinds of bait (banana and
   shrimp). The number of species decreased, and the species composition
   changed along the gradient of habitat degradation, suggesting that
   human-mediated habitat degradation has a significant effect on the
   mammalian communities. Our results suggest that forest cover is
   essential for at least 14 out of 29 recorded mammal species to survive,
   and that the forest fires and habitat isolation strongly affect
   particular species, i.e. Lariscus insignis and Trichys fasciculata

Abstract = {{Freshwater wetlands and marshes with extensive reed beds are important
   hotspots of biological diversity, but in the absence of proper
   management, they are subject to biotic homogenisation. We assessed the
   impact of spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing (for 4
   years) and late-summer burning (1 or 3 years before the study) on both
   songbirds and non-passerines in a previously homogeneous reed bed. We
   surveyed birds using a combination of line transects and point counts in
   a quasi-experimental design comprising six treatment levels. Management
   increased both the diversity of marsh habitats and the diversity of bird
   species. The species richness and abundance of non-passerines (ducks and
   geese, wading birds, gulls and terns, rails, coots and grebes) was
   higher in recently burned than in unburned or old-burned patches.
   Species richness of farmland songbirds was higher in grazed than in
   non-grazed patches, and the richness and abundance of reed songbirds was
   higher in unburned, old-burned, and grazed patches than in recently
   burned patches. Total Shannon diversity and evenness of birds was lowest
   in areas with the most intensive treatment (patches grazed and
   twice-burned), whereas Simpson diversity was highest in these areas.
   Non-managed patches had fewer species and individuals of all groups
   except reed songbirds. The proportion of old reed was low in recently
   burned and grazed patches, and was similarly high in all other treatment
   areas. No other property of reed stands was influenced by management,
   and both the allocation and the effect of management were independent of
   water level. Spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing and
   late-summer burning may thus simultaneously benefit several groups of
   birds. The effect of burning alone disappeared in 3 years, even in the
   presence of grazing; thus it must be repeated every 2-3 years. We
   conclude that both management actions are necessary to establish and
   maintain highly diverse habitats for marshland bird communities.}},

   We simulated vegetation change in a process-based model (Landscape and

   doubling of current atmospheric carbon dioxide over the next 50 years.
   We estimated the relative probability of bird occurrence on the basis of
   statistical models derived from field observations of birds and data on

   Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata), Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius

   probabilities of occurrence for our study area. Our simulations

   shrubland and decreases in grassland and Yucca spp. and ocotillo
   (Fouquieria splendens) vegetation. Generally, the relative probability
   of occurrence of all 3 species was highest in shrubland because
   leaf-area index values were lower in shrubland. This high probability of
   occurrence likely is related to the species' use of open vegetation for
   foraging. Fire suppression had little effect on projected vegetation
   composition because as climate changed there was less fuel and burned
   area. Our results show that if future water limits on plant type are
   considered, models that incorporate spatial data may suggest how and

Abstract = {{Management approaches taken in protected areas will affect their ability
   and effectiveness to conserve biodiversity. MalaMala (a concession
   within Sabi Sand Wildtuin, a private game reserve), and an adjacent area
   in the Kruger National Park (Kruger, statutory protected area) in South
   Africa provide a comparison of different types of conservation
   management. We measured three-dimensional woody vegetation structure, as
   an integral component of biodiversity, across 6200 ha in the two
   reserves using a LiDAR (Light-Detection-and-Ranging) sensor. We compared
   how different management approaches in the two reserves affected woody
   structural diversity. Vertical canopy diversity was measured using: i)
   percent cover of woody vegetation extracted from LiDAR canopy height
   models, ii) a volumetric pixel (voxel) approach to extract 3D vertical
   canopy-height profiles; and iii) horizontal diversity using landscape
   metrics. MalaMala had higher vegetation density than Kruger in the <3 m
   (2.5 times) and >6 m (2.7 times) height classes. This vegetation was in
   the form of larger, more cohesive patches as a result of the legacy of
   previous land-use (cattle ranching) and current management practices
   (bush clearing) and the recent increase in megaherbivores. Length of
   exposure to, and recent higher densities of, megaherbivores
   (particularly elephants) has altered the density of tall trees in the
   two reserves, thus affecting structural heterogeneity and associated
   habitat options for small-bodied vertebrates. These differences in
   vegetation structure are exacerbated by current management practices
   (e.g. bush-clearing and fire regime), with potential implications for
   faunal biodiversity conservation across a wide range of scales. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Bark beetles are well described in terms of life history and general

   Scolytus ventralis LeConte; and, pine engraver, fps pini (Say). Many
   interactions between bark beetles and other agents and resources have
   been described. Wildfire, windstorms, disease, other insects, and land
   management practices can weaken trees and attract bark beetles that
   become locally epidemic. At low population levels, beetles perform
   useful functions by creating habitat and forage for many organisms, but
   outbreaks can cause extensive tree mortality and increase risk of
   wildfire. Natural control agents such as birds, predatory beetles,
   parasitoids, and parasites, have been studied, but have not been
   employed operationally in management strategies. While
   semiochemcial-baited traps provide information about population
   fluctuations locally, large area monitoring relies primarily on aerial
   surveillance. Stand susceptibility, hazard, or risk-rating systems exist
   for most of these species, and infestation growth or damage models are
   available for a few. In most cases, pesticide sprays, attractants and
   anti-aggregants, and trap-tree techniques have been useful in specific
   applications. Anti-aggregants have been proven useful in large-scale
   operations for Douglas-fir beetle. Salvage or sanitation of infested,
   wind- or fire-damaged trees can prevent population build-ups if done
   promptly. Integration of these methods along with prescribed fire and
   tree thinning has been recommended. Decision-support tools are becoming
   more prevalent but each requires validation for different geographic

   Communities}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Dead wood comprises a vast amount of biological legacies that set the
   scene for ecological regeneration after wildfires, yet its removal is
   the most frequent management strategy worldwide. Soil-dwelling organisms
   are conspicuous, and they provide essential ecosystem functions, but
   their possible affection by different post-fire management strategies
   has so far been neglected. We analyzed the abundance, richness, and
   composition of belowground macroarthropod communities under two
   contrasting dead-wood management regimes after a large wildfire in the
   Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (Southeast Spain). Two plots at
   different elevation were established, each containing three replicates
   of two experimental treatments: partial cut, where trees were cut and
   their branches lopped off and left over the ground, and salvage logging,
   where all the trees were cut, logs were piled, branches were
   mechanically masticated, and slash was spread on the ground. Ten years
   after the application of the treatments, soil cores were extracted from
   two types of microhabitat created by these treatments: bare-soil (in
   both treatments) and under-logs (in the partial cut treatment only).
   Soil macroarthropod assemblages were dominated by Hemiptera and
   Hymenoptera (mostly ants) and were more abundant and richer in the
   lowest plot. The differences between dead-wood treatments were most
   evident at the scale of management interventions: abundance and richness
   were lowest after salvage logging, even under similar microhabitats
   (bare-soil). However, there were no significant differences between
   microhabitat types on abundance and richness within the partial cut
   treatment. Higher abundance and richness in the partial cut treatment
   likely resulted from higher resource availability and higher plant
   diversity after natural regeneration. Our results suggest that
   belowground macroarthropod communities are sensitive to the manipulation
   of dead-wood legacies and that management through salvage logging could
   reduce soil macroarthropod recuperation compared to other treatments
   with less intense management even a decade after application.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying where animals come from during population recovery can help
   to understand the impacts of disturbance events and regimes on species
   distributions and genetic diversity. Alternative recovery processes for
   animal populations affected by fire include external recolonization,
   nucleated recovery from refuges, or in situ survival and population
   growth. We used simulations to develop hypotheses about ecological and
   genetic patterns corresponding to these alternative models. We tested
   these hypotheses in a study of the recovery of two small mammals, the
   Australian bush rat and the agile antechinus, after a large (> 50 000
   ha), severe wildfire. The abundance of both species was severely reduced
   by fire and recovered to near or above pre-fire levels within two
   generations, yet we rejected a hypothesis of recovery by external
   recolonization. While the agile antechinus showed genetic evidence for
   far greater dispersal capacity than the bush rat, neither species showed
   gradients in abundance or genetic diversity with distance from unburnt
   forest during population recovery. Population recovery was driven by
   local-scale processes. However, the mechanisms differed between species,
   resulting from the spatial impacts of fire on habitat suitability. Agile
   antechinus populations recovered through population growth from in situ
   survivors. The bush rat followed a model of nucleated recovery,
   involving local recolonization from micro-refuges in topographic
   drainage lines. Nucleated recovery by the bush rat was associated with
   changes in dispersal, and fine-scale patterns of genetic admixture. We
   identified increased dispersal by females during recovery, contrasting
   with male-biased dispersal in unburnt forest. Such flexibility in
   dispersal can potentially increase recovery rates compared to
   expectations based on dispersal behavior within undisturbed populations.
   Our study shows how the initial distribution of survivors, determined by
   fire effects on resource distribution, determines the subsequent scaling
   of population recovery patterns, and the sensitivity of population
   distribution and genetic diversity to changing disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is widely used for conservation management in the savannah
   landscapes of northern Australia, yet there is considerable uncertainty
   over the ecological effects of different fire regimes. The responses of
   insects and other arthropods to fire are especially poorly known,
   despite their dominant roles in the functioning of savannah ecosystems.
   Fire often appears to have little long-term effect on ordinal-level
   abundance of arthropods in temperate woodlands and open forests of
   southern Australia, and this paper addresses the extent to which such
   ordinal-level resilience also occurs in Australia's tropical savannahs.
   The data are from a multidisciplinary, landscape-scale fire experiment
   at Kapalga in Kakadu National Park. Arthropods were sampled in the two
   major savannah habitats (woodland and open forest) using pitfall traps
   and sweep nets, in 15-20 km(2) compartments subjected to one of three
   fire regimes, each with three replicates: `early' (annual fires lit
   early in the dry season), `late' (annual fires lit late in the dry
   season), and `unburnt' (fires absent during the five-year experimental
   period 1990-94). Floristic cover, richness and composition were also
   measured in each sampling plot, using point quadrats. There were
   substantial habitat differences in floristic composition, but fire had
   no measured effect on plant richness, overall composition, or cover of
   three of the four dominant species. Of the 11 ordinal arthropod taxa
   considered from pitfall traps, only four were significantly affected by
   fire according to repeated-measures ANOVA. There was a marked reduction
   in ant abundance in the absence of fire, and declines in spiders,
   homopterans and silverfish under late fires. Similarly, the abundances
   of only four of the 10 ordinal taxa from sweep catches were affected by
   fire, with crickets and beetles declining in the absence of fire, and
   caterpillars declining under late fires. Therefore, most of the ordinal
   taxa from the ground and grass-layer were unaffected by the fire
   treatments, despite the treatments representing the most extreme fire
   regimes possible in the region. This indicates that the considerable
   ordinal-level resilience to fire of arthropod assemblages that has
   previously been demonstrated in temperate woodlands and open forests of
   southern Australia, also occurs in tropical savannah woodlands and open
   forests of northern Australia.}},

Title = {{Simulating the Effectiveness of Improvement Cuts and Commercial Thinning
   to Enhance Fire Resistance in West Coast Dry Mixed Conifer Forests}},

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-177}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nine multipurpose silvicultural treatments, formulated as a synthesis of
   recently implemented prescriptions offered by forest managers, were
   simulated to evaluate their effectiveness at enhancing fire resistance.
   The Forest Vegetation Simulator was applied, within the BioSum
   Framework, on over 3,000 Forest Inventory and Analysis plots
   representing 5 million hectares of dry mixed conifer forests in eastern
   Washington and Oregon and California's Sierra Nevada Mountains. We
   developed a composite fire-resistance score based on four fuel
   modification principals and metrics: fuel strata gap, canopy bulk
   density, proportion of basal area in resistant species, and predicted
   tree survival. The trajectories of stands with and without treatment
   were compared to evaluate effectiveness immediately post-treatment, and
   over the three decades that followed. Seventy percent of these forests
   could be effectively treated in the short term by at least one
   prescription. Pretreatment forest condition, particularly fire-resistant
   species abundance, strongly influenced short-term treatment success, and
   the post-treatment stand dynamics that limit treatment longevity.
   Treatment effectiveness endured only 10 or 20 years, depending on
   fire-resistant species abundance, owing to growing space for crown
   expansion generated by treatment plus regeneration and release and
   growth of understory tree strata.
   Study Implications: This simulation-based study confirmed that some
   mechanical fuel treatments currently applied in single- and multistory
   dry mixed conifer forests do immediately enhance resistance to crown
   fire on over 70 percent of forest area. Treatments that retain less
   density and eliminate understory trees are more successful as evaluated
   by a composite resistance score (CRS) that was designed to account for
   multiple fuels modification objectives, whereas treatments that retain
   three stories were typically ineffective. Treatment outcomes in both
   gain and attainment in CRS vary by initial conditions, particularly with
   respect to fire-resistant species abundance, and should be factored into
   decisions concerning treatment priority. Stands where resistant species
   are currently abundant benefit the most from treatment by enhancing or
   maintaining their resistance, whereas stands that lack resistant species
   offer few prospects for improved resistance. The fuel strata gap
   component of CRS offers latitude for managers to select the right gap
   for each stand based on their experience and knowledge of fuel models in
   planned treatment areas. Even the best treatments enhance resistance for
   no more than 20-30 years, so investments in fuel treatment must be
   followed by investments in treatment maintenance to realize a return on
   the initial treatment investment.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of biodiversity has been put to the highest priority
   throughout the world. The process of identifying threatened ecosystems

   present study aimed to generate spatial information on deforestation and
   ecological degradation indicators of fragmentation and forest fires
   using systematic conceptual approach in Telangana state, India.
   Identification of ecosystems facing increasing vulnerability can help to
   safeguard the extinctions of species and useful for conservation
   planning. The technological advancement of satellite remote sensing and
   Geographical Information System has increased greatly in assessment and
   monitoring of ecosystem-level changes. The areas of threat were
   identified by creating grid cells (5 x 5 km) in Geographical Information
   System (GIS). Deforestation was assessed using multi-source data of
   1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013. The forest cover of 40,746
   km(2), 29,299 km(2), 18,652 km(2), 18,368 km(2), 18,006 km(2), 17,556
   km(2) and 17,520 km(2) was estimated during 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985,
   1995, 2005 and 2013, respectively. Historical evaluation of
   deforestation revealed that major changes had occurred in forests of
   Telangana and identified 1095 extinct, 397 critically endangered, 523
   endangered and 311 vulnerable ecosystem grid cells. The fragmentation
   analysis has identified 307 ecosystem grid cells under critically
   endangered status. Forest burnt area information was extracted using
   AWiFS data of 2005 to 2014. Spatial analysis indicates total
   fire-affected forest in Telangana as 58.9 \% in a decadal period.
   Conservation status has been recorded depending upon values of threat
   for each grid, which forms the basis for conservation priority hotspots.
   Of existing forest, 2.1 \% grids had severe ecosystem collapse and had
   been included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I,
   followed by 27.2 \% in conservation priority hotspot-II and 51.5 \% in
   conservation priority hotspot-III. This analysis complements assessment
   of ecosystems undergoing multiple threats. An integrated approach
   involving the deforestation and degradation indicators is useful in
   formulating the strategies to take appropriate conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Louisiana Seaside Sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus fisheri) breed and
   winter exclusively in brackish and saline marshes along the northern
   Gulf of Mexico. Many Gulf Coast marshes, particularly in the Chenier
   Plain of southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas, are burned

   programs. Fire reportedly has negatively affected two Seaside Sparrow
   subspecies (A. in. nigrescens and A. m. mirabilis) in Florida, but there
   is no published information regarding effects of fire on A. m. fisheri.
   We compared abundance of territorial male Louisiana Seaside Sparrows,
   number of nesting activity indicators, and vegetation structure in
   paired burned and unburned plots in Chenier Plain marshes in
   southwestern Louisiana during the 1996 breeding season (April-July)
   before experimental winter burns (January 1997) and again during two
   breeding seasons post-burn (1997-1998). We found that abundance of male
   sparrows decreased in burned plots during the first breeding season
   post-bum, but was higher than that of unburned plots during the second
   breeding season post-burn. Indicators of nesting activity showed a
   similar but non-significant pattern in response to burning. Sparrow
   abundance and nesting activity seemingly are linked to dead vegetation
   cover, which was lower in burned plots during the first breeding season
   post-burn, but did not differ from that in unburned plots during the
   second breeding season post-burn. We recommend that marsh management
   plans in the Gulf Coast Chenier Plain integrate waterfowl and Seaside
   Sparrow management by maintaining a mosaic of burned and unburned

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1596-1605}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Predation is the leading cause of nest failure for many passerines and
   considerable effort is devoted to identifying the habitat
   characteristics and management practices that influence nest loss. The
   habitat components associated with nest loss are strongly influenced by
   the ecology of nest predators and differ among predator species as a
   result. Nevertheless, there is a tendency to generalize about the
   effects of habitat features and management on nest failure without
   considering how resulting patterns are influenced by nest predators. We
   examined how predator-specific patterns of nest loss differed among
   predators and in response to grassland management with fire and grazing
   by cattle (Bos taurus). We used video cameras to monitor and identify
   predators at nests of the Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), a
   species of conservation concern throughout its range. We observed
   predation by 15 different species that differed in their response to
   management and the habitat characteristics associated with nests they
   preyed on. Losses to mammals and snakes were more likely at nests with
   greater amounts of litter cover and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix).
   Mammals were less likely to prey on nests surrounded by greater forb
   cover. Nest predation by snakes was lower in burned areas, whereas
   predation by mammals and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) was
   unaffected by the use of fire. Neither vegetation density at the nest,
   nor landscape context was related to nest loss by any predator taxon.
   Although there were many similarities, we identified important
   differences in the species composing the nest predator community between
   our study and other published research. These differences are likely to
   be responsible for geographic variation in the influence of habitat
   features and management actions on nest success. Our results demonstrate
   the need for natural resource managers to incorporate knowledge of local
   nest predators and their ecology when developing management
   prescriptions aimed at enhancing the reproductive success of songbirds.}},

   Implications for Conservation, Restoration and Management}},
Journal = {{SILVA FENNICA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{785-806}},
Abstract = {{Due to the unprecedented loss of old-growth forests to harvesting
   throughout circumboreal regions an understanding of similarities and
   differences in old-growth dynamics is needed to design effective
   restoration, management and conservation efforts. This paper reviews
   concepts, prevalence and variability of old-growth forests across
   landscapes, and evaluates different stand scale dynamics at the
   old-growth stage across the circumboreal zone. Old-growth historically
   dominated many boreal forest landscapes in both Eurasia and North
   America. Throughout much of North America, and to some extent in western
   Siberia, the natural prevalence and development of old-growth forests
   are regulated by the occurrence of stand-replacing fires. In eastern
   North America and Siberia, insect outbreaks may, however, be more
   important. Insect outbreaks as well as recurrent non-stand replacing
   surface fires and windthrows, when occurring at the old-growth stage,
   often form stands characterized by several tree age-class cohorts. This
   multi age-class forest development type is common in Europe and eastern
   Siberia but its prevalence and importance in boreal North-America is not
   well documented. Similarities in successional dynamics across the
   circumboreal region are found in the development of mono-dominant
   even-aged stands, the replacement of shade intolerant tree species by
   shade tolerant species, as well as in all-aged stands driven by
   small-scale gap dynamics. The message to land managers is that the focus
   should not only be on setting aside remaining old-growth forests or in
   restoring static old-growth attributes, but also in emulating natural
   disturbances and successional dynamics at landscape and regional scales
   to maintain natural variability in old-growth attributes through time.}},

Abstract = {{Aims To assess the impact of various fire regimes over the past 30 years
   on land snail communities and to analyse the role of recent landscape
   history and the influence of biogeography in shaping the response
   patterns of gastropod communities following disturbances by fire.
   Location South-eastern France (Provence) and Mediterranean region.
   Methods Stratified sampling within 12 sites was undertaken with regard
   to fire regime (i.e. number of fires, fire intervals and age of the last
   fire) occurring over the past 30 years. The study was complemented by a
   historical analysis using aerial photographs, old maps of vegetation
   cover and an analysis of the biogeographical composition of
   malacofaunas. Data were investigated using Correspondence Analysis and
   Sorensen coefficient of similarity.
   Results When a disturbance regime (land use or fire disturbances) has
   been maintained over decades or centuries, land snail communities appear
   highly modified and tend to be composed of only Mediterranean and
   xerophilous species. However, low fire regimes, since the 1970s, do not
   seem to greatly affect the composition of gastropod communities. Indeed,
   shade-loving, mesophilous and European range species persist even after
   successive fires within some sites. In addition, the malacofaunas have a
   higher component of European range species with increasing distance from
   the Mediterranean sea.
   Main conclusions Analysis of the response patterns of gastropod
   communities to fire shows a response to numerous different factors. The
   composition of current land snail communities is not only the result of
   (more or less) recent patterns of fire regimes but also of anthropogenic
   disturbances, of landscape changes over the last centuries and of
   subsequent structure of the pre-fire habitat, as well as of the
   influence of a biogeographical gradient. However, the response patterns
   observed and the persistence of pre-fire communities imply the presence
   of cryptic refuges located within burned areas.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of mammals that depend on early successional forests or
   shrub-dominated habitats are declining in portions of the eastern United
   States. Although much of this decline can be attributed to maturation of
   young forests that once dominated the East, fragmentation and
   suppression of natural disturbances also have been implicated. Responses
   by habitat specialists (e.g., New England cottontails {[}Sylvilagus
   transitionalis]) and carnivores with large area requirements that rely
   on prey associated with early successional habitats (e.g., bobcats
   {[}Lynx rufus]) have been most extreme. Populations of facultative or
   opportunistic users of early successional habitats (e.g., black bears
   {[}Ursus americanus] and little brown bats {[}Myotis lucifugus])
   apparently have not been affected by fewer young stands. As eastern
   forests mature, biotic and abiotic forces will increase abundance of
   early successional habitats. However, maturation of these forests will
   take a century or more. In the meantime, using even-aged silviculture
   and applying controlled burns to native shrublands may be useful to
   alleviate current shortages. In landscapes modified substantially by
   suburban-urban developments and dense networks of roads, conventional
   management efforts likely will be insufficient. In these regions,
   increased populations of generalist predators are of exerting intense
   predation on mammalian herbivores that are restricted to small patches,
   and movement between patches by small mammals is limited. Mammals large
   area requirements also are hampered in these landscapes by frequent road
   crossings. These limitations may require implementing habitat management
   programs for mammals that differ from those developed for other
   disturbance-dependent taxa. Large (>10-ha), clustered patches of early
   successional habitat may be necessary to maintain viable populations.
   The effectiveness of these managed habitats will be further enhanced by
   positioning them close to existing land uses that are characterized by
   early successional habitats (e.g., powerline corridors). In agricultural
   landscapes, the representation of old-field habitats could be increased

Abstract = {{In West African savanna-woodland, the use of prescribed burning as a
   management tool has ecological implications for the soil biota. Yet, the
   effects of fire on soil inhabiting organisms are poorly understood. The
   aim of this study was to examine the responses of soil
   macro-invertebrates to early fires in a Sudanian savanna-woodland on a
   set of experimental plots subject to different fuel load treatments. The
   abundance of major macro-invertebrate taxa and functional groups, and
   taxon richness were quantified in soil cores collected from three
   different soil layers before and immediately after burning. The results
   indicated that, overall, there was substantial spatial and temporal
   variation in the composition of macro-invertebrate assemblages. The
   immediate effects of fire were to reduce total invertebrate numbers and
   numbers of many invertebrate groups dramatically. This is probably due
   to the fact that many of the surface-dwelling macrofauna perished as a
   result of less favorable microclimate due to fire, diminished resources,
   or migrate to safer environments. Fuel load treatment did not affect the
   community taxonomic richness or abundance of the soil-dwelling fauna.
   Furthermore, annual changes in community composition were more
   pronounced at the burnt site than in the control. This could be related
   to the inter-annual difference in precipitation pattern recorded during
   the two-year study period at our site. Since soil macrofauna population
   declines in fire-disturbed areas, increasing fire prevalence may
   jeopardize the long-term conservation of fire sensitive macrofauna
   groups. Special fire management attention is therefore recommended with
   due consideration to the type of burning and fuel properties to avoid
   the detrimental effects of intense fire affecting the resilience of
   savanna soil macrofauna species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Williamson's Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus thyroideus) are montane woodpeckers

   Current forest management plans focus on nesting trees, but the

   management strategy to mitigate habitat loss for this species. We
   investigated the selection of foraging trees in forests managed for
   timber extraction and maintenance of wildlife values using foraging
   observations of 27 radio-tagged adult Williamson's Sapsuckers during the

   pines (Pinus ponderosa) in the Western region (average dbh = 46 cm). For
   overall foraging activities, Williamson's Sapsuckers selected large,
   live Douglas-firs with signs of resin exudation and blistering
   (pitching), and avoided live lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta), quaking
   aspens (Populus tremuloides), and ponderosa pines. Larger trees and
   standing dead conifer trees were reused more often for foraging than
   smaller and live trees. The quality of Williamson's Sapsucker habitat
   could decrease over the long term if forest management practices reduce
   the overall size of trees or alter tree species composition to promote
   lodgepole pine. Forest management should focus on retaining and
   promoting large live Douglas-fir trees and large senescent or standing
   dead conifers (also used for nesting), which can be achieved by using
   thinning, prescribed fire, partial harvesting, and tree retention
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{We critically examine the hypothesis that dry forests in southern
   British Columbia evolved in the context of a low-severity fire-dominated
   disturbance regime, that fire suppression has led to ecological
   conditions which are radically different from the past, and that
   ``restoration{''} initiatives are required to re-establish former
   ecological conditions. Four sources of information were used to infer
   historic disturbance regimes and forest condition and to quantify the
   nature of disturbance since the early 1900s: (1) patterns of annual and
   seasonal weather and lightning strikes, (2) topographic variability, (3)
   records of wildfire, insect attack, and timber harvesting practices, and
   (4) early systematic forest surveys.
   Our analyses consistently indicate that historic natural disturbances
   were likely diverse and episodic at multiple spatial and temporal
   scales. High seasonal and annual variability in weather and the number
   of lightning strikes in complex topography suggest that a widespread
   low-severity fire regime is very unlikely. with a mixed-severity
   disturbance regime more consistent with our analyses. Although the
   nature of disturbance has changed from one largely dominated by fire and
   insect attack historically to harvesting and insect attack since 1950,
   the area disturbed annually has not diminished. Several interacting
   factors including climate, extensive fires coincident with European
   settlement, harvesting, fire suppression and insect attack have been key
   drivers in creating the conditions observed today. A complex,
   mixed-severity disturbance regime creates uncertainty about what
   represents ``natural{''} forest conditions, or what the target
   conditions for restoration activities are if the objective is to
   ``restore natural conditions{''}. We conclude that dry forest ecosystems
   in British Columbia typically experienced mixed-severity disturbance
   regimes that included fire, bark beetles and defoliators. Trying to
   ``restore{''} these forests with applications of frequent, low-severity
   fire is not an ecologically sound objective over large areas. Landscape
   management should focus on maintaining forest heterogeneity that would
   have existed historically under a mixed-severity disturbance regime.

Abstract = {{Conservation of native fishes and changing patterns in wildfire and,
   fuels are defining challenges for managers of forested landscapes in the
   western United States. Many species and populations of native fishes
   have declined in recorded history and some now occur as isolated
   remnants of what once were larger more complex systems. Land management
   activities have been viewed as one cause of this problem. Fires also can
   have substantial effects on streams and. riparian systems and may
   threaten the persistence of some populations of fish, particularly those
   that are small and isolated. Despite that, major new efforts to actively
   manage fires and fuels in forests throughout the region may be perceived
   as a threat rather than a benefit to conservation of native fishes and
   their habitats. The management of terrestrial and aquatic resources has
   often been contentious, divided among a variety of agencies with
   different goals and mandates. Management of forests, for example, has
   generally been-viewed as an impact on aquatic systems. Implementation of
   the management-regulatory process has reinforced a uniform approach to
   mitigate the threats to aquatic species and habitats that may be
   influenced by management activities. The problems and opportunities,
   however, are not the same across the landscapes of interest. Attempts to
   streamline the regulatory process often search for generalized solutions
   that may oversimplify the complexity of natural systems. Significant
   questions regarding the influence of fire on aquatic ecosystems,
   changing fire regimes, and the effects of fire-related management remain
   unresolved and contribute to the uncertainty. We argue that management
   of forests and fishes can be viewed as part of the same problem, that of
   conservation and restoration of the natural processes that create
   diverse and productive ecosystems. We suggest that progress toward more
   integrated management of forests and native fishes will require at least
   three steps: (1) better integration and development of a common
   conceptual foundation and ecological goals; (2) attention to landscape
   and ecological context; and (3) recognition of uncertainty. Published by

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{696-707}},

Abstract = {{Dry biofilm on rocks and other substrata forms an important drought
   refuge for benthic algae in intermittent streams following the cessation
   of flow. This dry biofilm is potentially susceptible to disturbance from
   bushfires, including direct burning and/or scorching and damage from
   radiant heat, particularly when streams are dry. Therefore, damage to
   dry biofilms by fire has the potential to influence algal recolonization
   and assemblage structure in intermittent streams following commencement
   of flow. The influence of fire on benthic algal assemblages and
   recolonization was examined in intermittent streams of the Grampians
   National Park, Victoria, Australia, using a field survey and
   manipulative field experiment. The field survey compared assemblages in
   two intermittent streams within a recently burnt area (within 5 months
   of the fire) with two intermittent streams within an unburnt area. The
   two burnt streams were still flowing during the fire so most biofilms
   were not likely to be directly exposed to flames. Considerable
   site-to-site and stream-to-stream variation was detected during the
   field survey, which may have obscured potential differences attributable
   to indirect effects of the fire. The manipulative field experiment
   occurred in two intermittent streams and consisted of five treatments
   chosen to replicate various characteristics of bus fires that may
   influence dry biofilms: dry biofilm exposed directly to fire; dry
   biofilm exposed to radiant heat; dry biofilm exposed to ash; and two
   procedural controls. After exposure to the different treatments, rocks
   were replaced in the streams and algae were sampled 7 days after flow
   commenced. Differences occurred across treatments, but treatment
   differences were inconsistent across the two streams. For example,
   direct exposure to fire reduced the abundance of recolonizing algae and
   altered assemblage structure in both streams, while radiant heat had an
   effect on assemblage structure in one stream only. The manipulative
   field experiment is likely to have represented the intensity of a small
   bushfire only. Nonetheless, significant differences across treatments
   were detected, so these experimental results suggest that fire can
   damage dry biofilms, and hence, influence algal recolonization and
   assemblage structure in intermittent streams.}},

   topographical heterogeneity to avian diversity in a fire-prone landscape}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{200}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems, uniformity in fire spread may be moderated by
   topography such that sheltered areas (e.g. gullies) escape fire.
   However, gullies are not immune to fire and, under extreme fire weather
   conditions, can burn. This may compromise their habitat value, and
   diminish differences in faunal communities across topographical
   gradients. We investigated the extent to which differences in avian
   communities persist when subjected to uniform fire severity and fire
   history across the gully and slope components of a forest site. We
   predicted that there would be less difference with increasing fire
   severity or long absence of fire. Birds were surveyed at 91 paired
   gully/slope sites in foothill eucalypt forests, two to three years after
   a large, severe wildfire in southeastern Australia. Sites were
   stratified in relation to four levels of fire severity (unburnt through
   to crown burnt) and two levels of fire history prior to the wildfire
   (burnt < 3 years, or > 20 years). Under similar conditions of fire
   severity and fire history, gullies maintained greater species richness
   and abundance than did slopes; averaging 13\% greater species richness
   and 32\% greater abundance, along with a distinct bird assemblage.
   However, contrary to predictions, topographical differences for most
   avian responses did not diminish with increasing fire severity or in the
   long absence of fire prior to the wildfire. This study highlights the
   value of forest gullies in maintaining or facilitating the recovery of
   distinct avian communities after wildfire, even when the gullies
   themselves have been burnt. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 200 y, cultural practices such as agriculture; fire
   suppression policies; elimination of native, large, grassland
   herbivores; grazing of domestic livestock; and introduction of exotic
   grass species have severely degraded, or in some cases completely
   eliminated, both tall- and shortgrass prairies. Throughout the central
   and midwestern states, only tiny remnants of undisturbed native
   grassland still exist. As such, several state and federal agencies as
   well as nongovernmental groups are involved in the restoration of
   degraded grassland sites. One recent restoration effort is at Bernheim
   Arboretum and Research Forest, located 40 km south of Louisville,
   Kentucky. Staff at Bernheim are attempting restoration of a 12-ha
   grassland degraded by many years of cattle grazing, erosion, and
   introduction of fescue (Fescue elatior). Little attention has been paid
   to the effects that small herbivores may have on the restoration
   process, though plant responses to herbivory are well documented, as are
   effects of large grazers on plant communities. In this study, we
   established 9 plots, 6 of which were enclosed by solid fencing. Three of
   the fenced plots were enhanced with prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster)
   while the other 3 had prairie voles excluded. The remaining 3 plots were
   left open to unmanipulated small mammal populations. Over the initial 2
   y of restoration efforts, which included prescribed burning, application
   of the herbicide Plateau (BASF), and seeding with 5 species of native
   grassland plants, we monitored aboveground plant biomass and used a pin
   frame to sample relative frequencies of forbs, grasses, woody stems, and
   bare areas among the plots. No significant differences were found among
   the plots in terms of the rate of change of biomass, although
   significant differences in relative frequencies of cover types were
   found among the plot types. Notably, animal-excluded plots tended toward
   more forb ground cover than grass cover over time. Recent studies,
   however, have indicated the importance of abiotic factors such as soil
   fertility and precipitation when assessing the overall effects grazing
   has on plant community structure. During this study, the area being
   restored experienced low rainfall, which in addition to the shallow,
   rocky soil characteristics may have been more influential in determining
   the structure of the plant community than biotic factors.}},

   October(late growing season; before leaf fall) with that from March and
   April (dormant season; before leaf expansion). Mortality of woody stems
   greater than or equal to 1 m tall was related (P < 0.002, r(2) greater

   intensity, rate of spread, and heat/unit area. During September-October,
   fires were less intense (P < 0.05) than during March-April, and less
   effective (P = 0.042) in reducing woody stems 1-3 m tall in the
   understory and lower midstory. Because of prolific sprouting, neither
   season of prescribed fires eliminated stems <1 m tall. March to April
   fires were most effective, in the short term, in controlling midstory
   encroachment. We recommend that studies using prescribed fire quantify
   fire behavior rather than using subjective descriptions and precisely

   Fescue-dominated grassland communities on CRP fields offer poor quality
   nesting, brood-rearing, and foraging habitat for northern bobwhite
   (Colinus virginianus) because of dense vegetation, high litter cover,
   low bare ground, and low plant diversity. Herbicide applications have
   been shown to reduce fescue and release early successional plant
   communities, and therefore may enhance bobwhite habitat quality.
   However, the relative efficacy of herbicide used in conjunction with
   fire has not been investigated. We tested singular and joint effects of
   herbicide (glyphosite) application and burning on vegetation in fescue
   CRP fields in east Mississippi. We tested the following 4 treatments:
   spring glyphosate application, spring bum, spring bum and glyphosate
   application, and control. All manipulations modified plant communities
   and enhanced bobwhite brood-rearing habitat to varying degrees. Spring
   bum increased bare ground and decreased litter cover (Pless than or
   equal to0.05). Spring herbicide application increased forbs, legumes,
   and annual weeds, but decreased grass and fescue canopy (Pless than or
   equal to0.05). Spring burn/herbicide application increased forbs,
   legumes, annual weeds, and bare ground but decreased grass canopy,
   fescue canopy, and litter cover (Pless than or equal to0.05). Canopy
   coverage of bobwhite food plants was greatest in spring burn/herbicide
   (Pless than or equal to0.05). Herbicide applied alone and in conjunction
   with burning enhanced bobwhite brood-rearing habitat in fescue CRP
   fields in east Mississippi by promoting early successional plant
   communities. This information has implications for implementation of

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{During disasters, the presence of companion animals is an identified
   risk for household relocation failure as well as premature return. In
   Australia, where bushfires are a regular summer threat, householders are
   encouraged to develop a written bushfire action plan that includes pets
   and animals. As part of this plan, householders are recommended to
   relocate themselves and their animals at least the day before a forecast
   catastrophic fire day. This advice is particularly relevant for horse
   owners, as the challenges and risks associated with evacuating horses
   are arguably much more complex than those for smaller companion animals.
   However, there is little empirical research on the plans and responses
   of horse owners to bushfire threat. In this paper, we present
   qualitative findings of semi-structured interviews with 21 households
   threatened by one of three significant fire events in South Australia in
   January 2014, all of which were responsible for a horse or pony. We
   describe and discuss nine different scenarios organised around intended
   and ultimate action. We found no apparent patterns between intentions
   and actions for pre-emptive relocation of horses. The extended
   explanations presented for each scenario provide important insight into
   equestrian cultures, especially in relation to plans, pre-emptive
   relocation, behaviour change, and `the horse community' in Australia. We
   question whether the pre-emptive relocation of horses is over-emphasised
   for bushfires, and ask if scenario-based planning with contingencies
   might be more useful and realistic.}},

Abstract = {{Oak savannas in the Midwestern United States are rare ecosystems heavily
   altered by human activity. Common land management practices, like
   prescribed fire can control invasive species and restore native plants,
   but few studies have examined the impacts of such practices on oak
   savanna invertebrate communities. We examined impacts of prescribed fire
   on ant nesting ecology in the Oak Openings of NW Ohio. We measured ant
   use of natural nests and colonization of artificial nests in savannas to
   examine ant nest-site limitation and colonization. We collected 376
   potential natural nests (362 acorns, 12 twigs and 2 other hollow nuts);
   161 in burned sites and 215 in unburned sites. In burned sites, seven
   (or 4.34\%) nests were occupied by ants and in unburned sites three (or
   1.4\%) were occupied, but nest occupation did not differ between burned
   and unburned areas. Overall 6.85\% of artificial nests were occupied;
   5.56\% in burned and 7.59\% in unburned areas, but again, the difference
   was not significant. Two pieces of evidence - ant use of artificial nest
   sites and negative correlations between natural nest occupation and
   natural nest availability - suggest that ants may be nest-site limited
   within the Oak Openings savannas. Ant richness and composition of ants
   found in natural nests was similar in burned and unburned areas;
   however, composition of ants in artificial nests tended to differ
   between habitats. These results suggest that burning did not impact
   frequency of nest occupation, or species composition of existing
   cavity-nesting ant colonies, but burning may alter colonization
   processes for cavity-nesting ants within savannas in the Oak Openings.}},

Abstract = {{Historical forest conditions in frequent-fire forests may be
   increasingly useful in guiding contemporary forest management given (1)
   projections for increased drought stress associated with climate change
   and (2) increases in vertical and horizontal fuel connectivity related
   to changes in land use over the past 150 years. Records from a 1922-25
   timber inventory reveal historical variability at the landscape-level on
   mixed-conifer habitats on the eastern slopes of the Cascade Range in
   northern Oregon. Live conifers >15 cm dbh (diameter at breast height)
   were tallied by species and diameter class in a 20\% sample of over
   50,000 hectares (ha). Forests were predominantly low density (66 tph,
   standard deviation = 32, range = 0-289) relative to current conditions
   (312 +/- 245, 0-1643 tph). Historical basal area averaged 14 +/- 7
   (0-70) m(2) ha(-1). Total stand density, large tree (>53 cm dbh)
   density, and ponderosa pine density were relatively stable across a wide
   moisture gradient (42-187 cm annual precipitation). Large trees
   dominated total basal area (73 +/- 16\%) and comprised 42 +/- 17\% of
   total trees per hectare (tph). Ponderosa pine contributed 62 +/- 27\% of
   basal area. Together, ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir constituted 91 +/-
   15\% of basal area. Large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir were nearly
   ubiquitous across the landscape in this historical data set, occurring
   on 94\% and 83\% of transects respectively. Large grand fir occurred on
   20\% of transects but contributed only 2 +/- 6\% to large tree basal
   area. Higher-density values (>120 tph), although rare, were distributed
   throughout the mixed-conifer habitat while large (>1.6 ha) treeless (no
   conifers >15 cm dbh) areas were almost entirely restricted to higher
   elevation, colder, wetter habitat types. Currently ponderosa pine no
   longer dominates large tree basal area, large trees no longer dominate
   total basal area, and Douglas-fir is now the dominant species across the
   landscape. Current mean tree densities are more than four times greater
   than values recorded in the historical cruise, and current basal area is
   approximately two times greater. Currently, large trees dominate basal
   area on only 29\% of area inventoried compared to 91\% in 1922-25. This
   systematic sample of a large landscape provides information about
   variability in species composition, densities, and structures at
   multiple spatial scales, which are highly relevant to management
   activities to restore and conserve desired ecosystem functions. Forest
   conditions comparable to those in this historical record have
   demonstrated resilience and resistance to fire and drought-related
   stressors in other frequent-fire forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Biologically rich savannas and woodlands dominated by Pinus palustris
   once dominated the southeastern U.S. landscape. With European
   settlement, fire suppression, and landscape fragmentation, this
   ecosystem has been reduced in area by 97\%. Half of remnant forests are
   not burned with sufficient frequency, leading to declines in plant and
   animal species richness. For these fire-suppressed ecosystems a major
   regional conservation goal has been ecological restoration, primarily
   through the reinitiation of historic fire regimes. Unfortunately, fire
   reintroduction in long-unburned Longleaf pine stands can have novel,
   undesirable effects. We review case studies of Longleaf pine ecosystem
   restoration, highlighting novel fire behavior, patterns of tree
   mortality, and unintended outcomes resulting from reintroduction of
   fire. Many of these pineland restoration efforts have resulted in
   excessive overstory pine mortality (often >50\%) and produced
   substantial quantities of noxious smoke. The most compelling mechanisms
   of high tree mortality after reintroduction of fire are related to
   smoldering combustion of surface layers of organic matter (duff) around
   the bases of old pines. Development of effective methods to reduce fuels
   and competing vegetation while encouraging native vegetation is a
   restoration challenge common to fire-prone ecosystems worldwide that
   will require understanding of the responses of altered ecosystems to the
   resumption of historically natural disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Upland moors and bogs in the United Kingdom are peatlands of high nature
   conservation value, many designated under the European Union's Habitat
   Directive, with internationally important bird populations, which depend
   on abundant invertebrate populations when breeding. Moorland management
   in the United Kingdom traditionally employs controlled burning in 10-30
   year rotations of heather, Calluna vulgaris, creating habitat mosaics of
   different species composition and physical structure. This can increase
   overall invertebrate biodiversity and abundance, for certain key
   invertebrate groups. Burning has potential negative environmental
   effects, including peat erosion and contamination of drinking-water
   supplies. Rotational cutting of vegetation is now being trialled as an
   alternative to burning, but its long-term effects on invertebrates are
   poorly understood. We surveyed invertebrates on a 16-year chronosequence
   of rotational cutting on an extensive area of dwarf shrub vegetation on
   upland peat soils in Northern England. Invertebrate Simpson diversity
   was greatest on intermediate-aged patches, and along edges between cut
   and uncut areas. Older patches, cut between 2000 and 2008, were
   dominated by ants (Hymenoptera-Formicidae), plant-feeding bugs
   (Hemiptera-Auchenorrhyncha) and parasitic wasps
   (Hymenoptera-Parasitica). Patches cut more recently, between 2009 and
   2016, had significantly lower invertebrate abundance, and were dominated
   by predatory ground beetles (Coleoptera-Carabidae), ants and harvestmen
   (Opiliones). There were significant relationships between vegetation and
   invertebrate community composition under both invertebrate sampling
   methods. We recommend that rotational cutting is used as the primary
   means of management, it should be undertaken in approximately 15-20 year
   rotations, in irregularly shaped mosaics, to maximise the benefits to
   invertebrates and associated wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{Forest densification, wildfires, and disease can reduce the growth and
   survival of hardwood trees that are important for biological and
   cultural diversity within the Pacific Northwest of USA. Large,
   full-crowned hardwoods that produce fruit and that form large cavities
   used by wildlife were sustained by frequent, low-severity fires prior to
   Euro-American colonization. Shifts in fire regimes and other threats
   could be causing declines in, large hardwood trees. To better understand
   whether and where such declines might be occurring, we evaluated recent
   trends in Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from 1991-2016 in
   California and southern Oregon. We included plots that lay within areas
   of frequent fire regimes during pre-colonial times and potential forest
   habitats for fisher, a rare mammal that depends on large live hardwoods.
   We analyzed changes in basal area for eight hardwood species, both
   overall and within size classes, over three time periods within
   ecoregions, and in public and private land ownerships. We found the
   basal area to generally be stable or increasing for these species.
   However, data for California black oak suggested a slight decline in
   basal area overall, and among both very large trees and understory
   trees; that decline was associated with fire mortality on national
   forest lands. In addition, mature trees with full crowns appeared to
   sharply decline across all species. Many trends were not statistically
   significant due to high variation, especially since more precise data
   from remeasured trees were only available for the two most recent time
   periods. Continued analysis of these indicators using remeasured trees
   will help to evaluate whether conservation efforts are sustaining large,

Abstract = {{Questions Ants and rodents are recognized as ecosystem engineers
   worldwide creating soil-modified nests and adjacent edges with superior
   resources. The influence of Dipodomys spectabilis (rat) and Pogonomyrmex
   rugosus (ant) on nests and edges would be similar in burned and unburned
   habitat on functional groups' cover, density, number of inflorescences
   and species number. We hypothesize that annual and perennial dicots
   would recover faster on rat patches than on burned grassland, dicots and
   grasses would recover faster on ant patches than on burned grassland,
   and annual dicots would recover faster on rat than on ant patches,
   whereas grasses would recover faster on ant than on rat patches.
   Location Semiarid grassland, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New
   Mexico, USA. Methods We analyzed annual and perennial dicots, grasses
   and subshrubs in burned and unburned plots at 80 nests during cool- and
   warm-seasons two years post-fire. Data were collected at nest top
   (mound), edge, and 20 m (control) from the edge. Results Cover, density
   and species richness of different functional groups were low on animal
   mounds in unburned and burned plots. Ant edges had greater perennial
   dicot cover, grass cover and richness while rat edges had lower grass
   density and richness than control sites at unburned and burned plots.
   Perennial dicot density and richness recovered faster at rat mounds and
   edges than control. Ant edges yielded faster recovery of grass
   inflorescences than control. Dicots recovered faster on rat than ant
   mounds whereas grasses grew faster on ant edges. Conclusions Rats create
   nests enhancing density of recovering dicots and ant edges facilitate
   reproduction of recovering grasses. Equal regeneration between animal
   nests and grassland occurred commonly when fire reduced grass
   competition. Dysochory, granivory and fire intensity may influence
   recovery. Nests may be sources of reestablishment and seed dispersal.
   Recovery of grassland may be amplified as plants infill from engineered

Abstract = {{Thinning ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests to achieve desired
   ecological conditions remains a priority in the North American west. In
   addition to reducing the risk of high-severity wildfires in unwanted
   areas, stand thinning may increase wildlife and plant diversity and
   provide increased opportunity for seedling recruitment. We initiated
   conservative (i.e. minimal removal of trees) ponderosa stand thinning
   treatments with the goals of reducing fire risk and improving habitat
   conditions for native wildlife and flora. We then compared site
   occupancy of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), chipping sparrows
   (Spizella passerina), plumbeous vireos (Vireo plumbeus), and western
   wood-pewees (Contopus sordidulus) in thinned and unthinned (i.e.,
   control) forest stands from 2007 to 2009. Survey stations located in
   thinned stands had 64\% fewer trees/ha, 25\% less canopy cover, and 23\%
   less basal area than stations in control stands. Occupancy by all three
   host species was negatively associated with tree density, suggesting
   that these species respond favorably to forest thinning treatments in
   ponderosa pine forests. We also encountered plumbeous vireos more
   frequently in plots closer to an ecotonal (forest/grassland) edge, an
   association that may increase their susceptibility to edge-specialist,
   brood parasites like brown-headed cowbirds. Occupancy of brown-headed
   cowbirds was not related to forest metrics but was related to occupancy
   by plumbeous vireos and the other host species in aggregate, supporting
   previous reports on the affiliation between these species. Forest
   management practices that promote heterogeneity in forest stand
   structure may benefit songbird populations in our area, but these
   treatments may also confer costs associated with increased cowbird
   occupancy. Further research is required to understand more on the
   complex relationships between occupancy of cowbirds and host species,
   and between cowbird occupancy and realized rates of nest parasitism. (C)

Abstract = {{Biodiversity declines have been driven by land-use changes in
   semi-natural grasslands worldwide. This is thought to be because
   threatened species are unable to compete with generalist species, which
   are better adapted to the new environments created by modern land-use
   management. Many studies have separately examined biodiversity declines
   resulting from land abandonment and intensified use, however few have
   examined their unified effects on biodiversity. In addition, we still do
   not fully understand the relative importance of decreasing habitat area
   in comparison to changes in land-use practice with regard to
   biodiversity. To clarify the roles of these interconnected variables, we
   compared the diversity of threatened and common herbivorous insects and
   plants among four land-use types (traditional, annual burning, annual
   mowing, and abandoned) during 2012 and 2013. Next, we examined whether a
   relationship exists between herbivorous insects and environmental
   variables (species richness of plants, as well as current and historical
   grassland areas). We showed that land-use changes (annual burning,
   annual mowing and/or land abandonment) diminished the diversity of
   threatened butterflies, orthopterans, and plants. Herbivorous insects
   were affected by land-use practices rather than grassland area. Our
   results suggest that to conserve threatened species in semi-natural
   grasslands, we should reintroduce traditional land-use practices in
   areas that currently experience modern practices, such as annual mowing
   and burning. The reintroduction of traditional management practices
   would allow for the recovery of plant biodiversity, thereby increasing
   herbivorous insect diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A decade after its creation, the Northwest Forest Plan is contributing
   to the conservation of old-growth forests on federal land. However, the
   success and outlook for the plan are questionable in the dry provinces,
   where losses of old growth to wildfire have been relatively high and
   risks of further loss remain. We summarize the state of knowledge of
   old-growth forests in the plan area, identify challenges to conserve
   them, and suggest some conservation approaches that might better meet
   the goals of the plan. Historically, old-growth forests in these
   provinces ranged from open, patchy stands, maintained by frequent
   low-severity fire, to a mosaic of dense and open stands maintained by
   mixed-severity fires. Old-growth structure and composition were
   spatially heterogeneous, varied strongly with topography and elevation,
   and were shaped by a complex disturbance regime of fire, insects, and
   disease. With fire suppression and cutting of large pines (Pinus spp.)
   and Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii {[}Mirbel] Franco), old-growth
   diversity has declined and dense understories have developed across
   large areas. Challenges to conserving these forests include a lack of
   definitions needed for planning of fire-dependent old-growth stands and
   landscapes, and conflicts in conservation goals that can be resolved
   only at the landscape level. Fire suppression has increased the area of
   the dense, older forest favored by Northern Spotted Owls (Strix
   occidentalis caurina) but increased the probability of high-severity
   fire. The plan allows for fuel reduction in late-successional reserves;
   fuel treatments, however, apparently have not happened at a high enough
   rate or been applied in a landscape-level approach. Landscape-level
   strategies are needed that prioritize fuel treatments by vegetation
   zones, develop shaded fuel breaks in strategic positions, and thin and
   apply prescribed fire to reduce ladder fuels around remaining old trees.
   Evaluations of the current and alternative strategies are needed to
   determine whether the current reserve-matrix approach is the best
   strategy to meet plan goals in these dynamic landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has a major influence on the structure and composition of temperate

   Australia. Floristics and ground layer attributes were investigated at
   small (0.25m(2)) and large (100m(2)) spatial scales in regularly burnt
   and unburnt grasslands. Fire exclusion over a 10 year period led to
   declines in native species diversity, richness and cover at both spatial
   scales and in most cases effects were consistent regardless of soil
   texture. However, the richness of native plant species at small scales
   and the cover of native plants at large scales were most negatively
   influenced by fire exclusion on fine textured soils. Conversely, at
   large scales, exotic plant richness and cover were only weakly increased
   by fire exclusion. Responses of eight common species were modelled and
   in seven of these, fire exclusion was a strong predictor of occurrence,

Abstract = {{Plant population models are valuable tools for assessing ecological
   tradeoffs between forest management approaches. In addition, these
   models can provide insight on plant life history patterns and processes
   important for persistence and recovery of populations in changing
   environments. In this study, we evaluated a set of ecological
   restoration alternatives for their long-term effects on buckbrush
   (Ceanothus fendleri Gray), a shrub common in understories of ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) forests of the
   southwestern United States. The field data were collected from a set of
   forest restoration units located on the Fort Valley Experimental Forest.
   We constructed simple stage-based models in order to simulate 25-year
   population dynamics. Results showed that scenarios that included
   overstory thinning, herbivore protection, and prescribed fire resulted
   in buckbrush populations with significantly greater numbers of
   aboveground stems than populations in the other alternatives. Vegetative
   stem recruitment, flowering, and seedling emergence were important in
   producing these results. For alternatives that included protection from
   herbivores, burning at 2-year frequencies resulted in populations with
   significantly greater numbers of aboveground stems than scenarios with
   longer intervals between burning. In contrast, frequent burning in
   alternatives without herbivore protection resulted in population
   decline. These results indicate that protecting buckbrush from large
   herbivores allowed plants to complete life cycles and fully express
   these life history traits. This research demonstrates that population
   modeling can help illuminate ecological tradeoffs associated with land
   management alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{The Sierra Madre Occidental and neighboring Madrean Sky Islands span a
   large and biologically diverse region of northwest Mexico and portions
   of the southwestern United States. Little is known about the abundance
   and habitat use of breeding birds in this region of Mexico, but such
   information is important for guiding conservation and management. We
   assessed densities and habitat relationships of breeding birds across
   Sky Island mountain ranges in Mexico and adjacent portions of the Sierra
   Madre from 2009 to 2012. We estimated densities at multiple spatial
   scales, assessed variation in densities among all major montane
   vegetation communities, and identified and estimated the effects of
   important habitat attributes on local densities. Regional density
   estimates of 65\% of 72 focal species varied significantly among eight
   montane vegetation communities that ranged from oak savannah and
   woodland at low elevations to pine and mixed-conifer forest at high
   elevations. Greater proportions of species occurred at peak densities or
   were relatively restricted to mixed-conifer forest and montane riparian
   vegetation likely because of higher levels of structural or floristic
   diversity in those communities, but those species were typically rare or
   uncommon in the Sky Islands. Fewer species had peak densities in oak and
   pine-oak woodland, and species associated with those communities were
   often more abundant across the region. Habitat models often included the
   effects of broadleaf deciduous vegetation cover (30\% of species),
   which, together with tree density and fire severity, had positive
   effects on densities and suggest ways for managers to augment and
   conserve populations. Such patterns combined with greater threats to
   high-elevation conifer forest and riparian areas underscore their value
   for conservation. Significant populations of many breeding bird species,
   including some that are of concern or were not known to occur regionally
   or in mountain ranges we surveyed, highlight the importance of
   conservation efforts in this area of Mexico.}},

Title = {{Habitat complexity and individual acorn protectors enhance the post-fire
   restoration of oak forests via seed sowing}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{276-280}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Oak reforestation via direct sowing has advantages over planting for
   economic and plant-morphological reasons, but the risk of high acorn
   predation usually dissuades land managers from using this method. In a
   previous study we hypothesised that overcoming acorn predation would
   require both large-scale solutions to reduce predation by large mammals
   - which we had effectively obtained through ecosystem management leading
   to greater habitat complexity - and small-scale protection to tackle
   predation by small mammals - which we had been unsuccessful to
   encounter. In this study we aimed to test this hypothesis under the same
   management areas but with a new acorn-scale protective device named seed
   shelter. We carried out an acorn predation experiment in Sierra Nevada
   (S Spain), in a burnt area with three replicates of each of two
   post-fire management treatments: non-intervention (NI), with high
   habitat complexity due to the abundance of lying burnt trees, and
   salvage logging (SL), with low habitat complexity due to the previous
   felling and piling of the tree trunks and chopping of the branches. In
   each replicate we sowed 50 acorns with seed shelter and 50 acorns
   without (N = 600 acorns). After 129 days, predation by rodents averaged
   17\% for control acorns, while the seed shelter reduced this to nil.
   Predation by boars (17.5\% overall) was not affected by the seed shelter
   but was reduced to one-sixth in the NI treatment (5\% vs 30\% in SL), so
   we obtained the lowest overall predation rates in the combined NI + seed
   shelter treatment (5\%). We thus corroborated our hypothesis that
   combining large-scale management with an acorn-scale protection can
   greatly increase the success of sowing. We expect these outcomes to
   increase the effectiveness of direct sowing and to raise the share of
   this practice in reforestation, especially for species that develop best
   with direct sowing such as oaks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Oak (Quercus spp.) savannas are among the most imperiled ecosystems in
   the United States. Consequently, associated vegetation and avian
   communities are also in decline. Furthermore, restoration of savanna
   communities may be an important strategy for conserving avian species
   that require early successional habitat, a type underrepresented on
   regional landscapes. Therefore, we evaluated savanna restoration on
   twelve sites in the Mid-South USA. Specifically, we examined grass,
   forb, legume, and woody understory cover, regeneration and sapling
   density, and breeding bird use of the sites following mechanical
   overstory thinning and dormant-season fire using a hierarchical linear
   model. Total grass cover was negatively related to canopy cover (P <
   0.01) and total forb cover was negatively related to total basal area (P
   = 0.04). Oak regeneration density was positively related to canopy cover
   (P < 0.01), while oak competitor regeneration density was positively
   related to percent slope (P = 0.01) and sapling density (P = 0.01).
   Shrub/scrub birds were common within sites undergoing restoration. Only
   three obligate grassland bird species, eastern kingbird (Tyrannus
   tyrannus), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) and dickcissel
   (Spiza americana), were detected on one site. Presence of indigo
   buntings (Passerina cyanea) was positively related to groundlayer
   development. Canopy reduction and burns outside the dormant season may
   both be critical to restoration of savannas and associated avifauna in
   the region.}},

   in four of the six years of our study. Henslow's Sparrow distributions
   were influenced by time since the last fire and location in the prairie
   (census-point effect). Sparrows usually did not occur in burned areas
   during the first growing season postfire and colonized adjacent unburned
   sections of the prairie as other sections were burned. Henslow's
   Sparrows were rarefy recorded at some census points regardless of their
   burn history. The birds appeared to exhibit a hierarchical pattern of
   habitat occupancy, with use of secondary portions of the prairie being
   greatest in years of high overall abundance or when burning made primary
   areas unsuitable. Sparrow abundance tended to increase in years when
   spring precipitation in the current year exceeded that of the preceding
   year and to decline in years when spring precipitation declined.
   Although Henslow's Sparrows were sensitive to fire, our data suggest
   that numbers can be maintained, and even increased, on large prairies

Abstract = {{We documented patterns of species extirpation, shifts in species
   dominance, and rates of recolonization of litter-layer arthropod species
   following a catastrophic forest fire. The study site was located along
   the Rio Grande within the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge,
   Socorro County, NM, in a riparian forest dominated by cottonwood
   {[}Populus deltoides ssp. wislizenii (S. Watson) Eckenwalder] and salt
   cedar (Tamarix chinensis Loureiro). The forest-floor arthropod community
   was sampled with 18 pitfall traps during 1994-1997. The study site
   burned in June 1996, and the intense fire reduced the litter layer to
   mineral ash and killed all the above-ground portions of trees; salt
   cedar and some cottonwood trees began to stump-sprout shortly after the
   fire, and achieved heights of two in by October 1996. The prefire
   forest-floor arthropod community consisted of 80 species, dominated by
   spiders (Lycosidae, Gnapbosidae, Salticidae), beetles (Carabidae,
   Staphylinidae, Cryptophagidae, Tenebrionidae), isopods (Armadillidae,
   Porcellionidae) and crickets (Gryllidae). The surviving postfire
   arthropod community was dominated by generalist ants (Formicidae). The
   dominant cricket, Gryllus alogus Rehn (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) I
   exhibited a rapid recovery in abundance following the fire, and the
   number of certain species that preferred open, bare-ground habitat
   {[}e.g., the tiger beetle Cicindela punctulata Olivier (Coleoptera:
   Carabidae)] increased on the burned site. During the 9 mo following the
   fire, 79 arthropod species were recorded from the fire site, 29 (37\%)
   of which had not been recorded before the fire. Of the original prefire
   80 artbropod species, 30 species (37\%) were not recorded after the
   fire, and overall arthropod abundance was substantially reduced. The
   extirpated species were generally uncommon before the fire, while the
   more abundant species displayed more successful recolonization. These
   results suggest that wildfire in the Rio Grande riparian forest of New
   Mexico can have a substantial, short-term impact on abundance and
   species composition of the forest-floor arthropod community, and that
   both survivor activity and recolonization processes by dominant species
   can be rapid. Given the capacity for rapid recolonization by these
   arthropod species, the long-term recovery of the forest-floor arthropod
   assemblage will likely be driven by the postfire recovery rate of the
   plant community and eventual structure and composition of the forest
   floor litter layer.}},

Abstract = {{Fire occurrences are a common perturbation in Cerrado ecosystems, and
   may differently impact the local biodiversity. Arthropods are one of the
   taxa affected by fires, and among them, ants are known as good
   bioindicators. We aimed to evaluate the effect of anthropic fires on
   epigaeic and hypogaeic ant communities (species richness and
   composition) in Cerrado areas with different post-fire event recovery
   periods. We conducted the study in four Cerrado areas during two weeks
   of 2012 dry season: one unburned and three at different post-fire times
   (one month, one and two years). We sampled ants with pitfall traps in
   epigaeic and hypogaeic microhabitats. We collected 71 ant morpho-species
   from 25 genera. In the epigaeic microhabitat we sampled 56
   morpho-species and 42 in the hypogaeic microhabitat. The area with the
   shortest recovery time presented lower epigaeic ant species richness
   (4.3 +/- 2.00) in comparison to the other areas (8.1 +/- 2.68 species on
   one year area; 10.3 +/- 2.66 species on two years area; 10.4 +/- 2.31
   species on control area), but recovery time did not affect hypogaeic ant
   species richness. Regarding ant species composition, fire did not
   directly affect hypogaeic ant species, which remained the same even one
   month after fire event. However, two years were not enough to
   reestablish ant species composition in both microhabitats in relation to
   our control group samples. Our study is the first to assess anthropic
   fire effects upon epigaeic and hypogaeic ants communities; highlighting
   the importance of evaluating different microhabitats, to more accurately
   detect the effects of anthropic disturbances in biological communities.
   We concluded that ant communities are just partially affected by fire
   occurrences, and epigaeic assemblages are the most affected ones in
   comparison to hypogaeic ants. Furthermore the study provides knowledge
   to aid in the creation of vegetation management programs that allow
   Cerrado conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern five-lined skink, Eumeces inexpectatus, occurs in a
   wide range of habitats throughout Florida, but it is most abundant in
   scrub and sandhill (high pine) habitats. Both the scrub and sandhill
   habitats are fire maintained, and resident animals respond to the
   frequency of burning. During 7 yr of study, adult males were trapped
   most often in March and April and adult females most often after nesting
   and hatching of young, from late June to mid-July. As judged by the
   number of individuals captured, I determined that plots of sandhill
   protected from fire for about two decades or burned on 5 or 7 yr cycles
   support more individuals than plots burned on either 1 or 2 yr cycles.
   Differences in the number of skinks found in plots subjected to the
   three burn frequencies likely reflect the structure of the habitat.
   Frequent burning reduces the amount of litter and tree canopy, produces
   patches of open ground, and promotes the growth of herbaceous plants.
   Plots protected from fire have thick layers of litter which provide
   shelter and foraging habitat for southeastern five-lined skinks. Plots
   burned on 5 or 7 yr cycles have sufficient time to accumulate litter
   between fires to provide good quality habitat for this species.}},

Abstract = {{Mosaic burning is the deliberate creation of a mosaic of patches
   representing different fire histories. It is often recommended for
   management of Australia's natural landscapes, on the assumption that it
   enhances biodiversity and reduces fire hazard through increased spatial
   and temporal diversity of fuel loads and species composition. It is also
   suggested that such fire practices were used throughout Australia by
   traditionally living Aboriginal people. Although the creation of a
   patchwork of different fire histories may be an effective management
   tool in modern land management, the evidence for universal mosaic
   burning before European settlement deserves scrutiny. The records of
   explorers, early settlers and anthropologists relating to a large
   portion of the Lake Eyre Basin, particularly the Channel country and the
   Simpson Desert region, were examined. It is concluded that extensive
   gaps in the records of smokes and large fires are important and
   meaningful, and do not represent a failure to record fires. The case for
   universal mosaic burning in the region is not supported by the evidence
   although mosaic burning did occur in specific circumstances. Fire
   practices were shaped by complex and interacting factors including the
   vegetation and terrain type, for example the occurrence of
   spinifex-dominated sandhills or stony deserts; seasonal conditions and
   the presence or not of adequate fuel loads; how readily Aboriginal
   people could access country and their reasons for using or not using

Abstract = {{Fire is a major driving force of landscape change in the Mediterranean
   region. The objectives of this paper were to explore the implications of
   landscape change and wildfires in a region of northwestern Portugal for
   the diversity of breeding birds. Land use cover for the years 1958,
   1968, 1983 and 1995 was obtained from aerial photography for a study
   area of 3700 ha. Breeding bird assemblages in each of six land use
   categories were characterized in 1998 using point counts. The main
   landscape changes in the study area across the 40 years were a decrease
   in the area of agricultural land and low shrublands (respectively 29\%
   and 48\%) and an increase in forests and tall shrublands (both over
   95\%). Bird assemblages showed increased richness and diversity across
   the gradient: low shrublands --> tall shrublands --> conifer --> mixed
   --> deciduous --> agricultural areas. Many of the species with narrow
   niche breadth (specialists) were associated with agricultural areas and
   deciduous forests. In spite of the low diversity of burned areas (mostly
   shrublands) a few specialist species depend on this habitat. Thus, the
   current fire regime probably contributes to maintaining bird diversity
   at the landscape level. There was an inverse relationship between
   landscape diversity and estimated bird diversity across the last 40
   years. Landscape management actions to preserve bird diversity should
   focus on the maintenance of agricultural land and deciduous forests. In
   parallel, a wider use of prescribed burning and grazing is suggested.

Abstract = {{Fire shapes biome distribution and community composition worldwide, and
   is extensively used as a management tool in flammable landscapes. There
   is growing concern, however, that fire could increase the vulnerability
   of native fauna to invasive predators. We developed a conceptual model
   of the ways in which fire could influence predator-prey dynamics. Using
   a before-after, control-impact experiment, we then investigated the
   short-term effects of a prescribed fire on 2 globally significant
   invasive mesopredators (red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and feral cat, Felis
   catus) and their native mammalian prey in a fire-prone forest of
   southeastern Australia. We deployed motion-sensing cameras to assess
   species occurrence, collected predator scats to quantify diet and prey
   choice, and measured vegetation cover before and after fire. We examined
   the effects of the fire at the scale of the burn block (1,190 ha), and
   compared burned forest to unburned refuges. Pre-fire, invasive predators
   and large native herbivores were more likely to occur at sites with an
   open understory, whereas the occurrence of most small- and medium-sized
   native mammals was positively associated with understory cover. Fire
   reduced understory cover by more than 80\%, and resulted in a 5-fold
   increase in the occurrence of invasive predators. Concurrently, relative
   consumption of medium-sized native mammals by foxes doubled, and
   selection of long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and short-beaked
   echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) by foxes increased. Occurrence of bush
   rats (Rattus fuscipes) declined. It was unclear if fire also affected
   the occurrence of bandicoots or echidnas, as changes coincided with
   normal seasonal variations. Overall, prescribed fire promoted invasive
   predators, while disadvantaging their medium-sized native mammalian
   prey. Further replication and longer-term experiments are needed before
   these findings can be generalized. Nonetheless, such interactions could
   pose a serious threat to vulnerable species such as critical weight
   range mammals. Integrated invasive predator and fire management are
   recommended to improve biodiversity conservation in flammable
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) is a species of conservation
   concern throughout its range and an effective indicator of healthy pine
   savanna ecosystems in the southeastern United States. Their secretive
   nesting behavior means that many aspects of their nesting ecology,
   including specific knowledge of the nest predator community and nest
   defense behaviors are insufficiently described. This information is an
   important first step in determining the link between management
   practices and reproductive success. We monitored 86 Bachman's Sparrow
   nests, 65 with constant video surveillance, to describe the nest
   predator community, cause-specific nest mortality rate, and nest defense
   behavior. We identified 12 predator species from 37 predation events.
   Snakes were the dominant predator type, responsible for 51\% of
   identified predation events, followed by mesomammals (19\%), small
   mammals (16\%), and others (14\%). Nest defense behavior included
   ptiloerection and chasing but was rare (16\% of predation events) and
   effective 67\% of the time. Daily nest survival was 0.936 (CI: 0.894 -
   0.967) and neither season, year, nor site explained a significant amount
   of variation in estimates of cause-specific daily nest mortality.
   Raccoons were not detected at Bachman's Sparrow nests despite being one
   of the most common nest predators in other avian nest surveillance
   studies. Future studies should explore the link between prescribed fire,

Abstract = {{Climate change and fire suppression have altered fire regimes globally,

   of coldwater stream biota to single wildfires are well studied, but
   measured responses to consecutive wildfires in warmwater systems that

   availability, and biomass of cold- and warmwater oligochaetes, insects,
   crayfish, fishes, and tadpoles following consecutive megafires (covering
   >100 km(2)) in the upper Gila River, New Mexico, USA. We were
   particularly interested in comparing responses of native and nonnative
   fishes that might have evolved under different disturbance regimes.
   Changes in habitat and resource availability were related to cumulative
   fire effects, fire size, and postfire precipitation. The 2nd of 2
   consecutive wildfires in the basin was larger and, coupled with moderate
   postfire discharge, resulted in increased siltation and decreased algal
   biomass. Several insect taxa responded to these fires with reduced
   biomass, whereas oligochaete biomass was unaffected. Biomass of 6 of 7
   native fish species decreased after the fires, and decreases were
   associated with site proximity to fire. Nonnative fish decreases after
   fire were most pronounced for coldwater salmonids, and warmwater
   nonnative fishes exhibited limited responses. All crayfish and tadpoles
   collected were nonnative and were unresponsive to fire disturbance. More
   pronounced responses of native insects and fishes to fires indicate that
   increasing fire size and frequency threatens the persistence of native

Abstract = {{Gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) populations are declining
   range-wide primarily because of habitat loss, fragmentation, and
   degradation, but low recruitment due to nest predation also may be
   contributing to this decline. The relationship of nest location and nest
   survival is unknown. Therefore, our objective was to determine whether
   nest location influenced depredation risk and potential recruitment
   success. Between 30 May 2013 and 3 September 2014, we constructed and
   monitored 105 artificial gopher tortoise nests (45 in 2013 and 60 in
   2014) with 35 nests at each of 3 classifications of nest sites: within
   active burrow aprons (i.e., the mound of sand at the burrow entrance),
   inactive burrow aprons, and open sandy sites. Using the artificial
   nests, we investigated the influence of nest site classification,
   distance to road, and prescribed fire frequency (<1 year and 1 year
   since burn) on gopher tortoise nest survival. Additionally, we monitored
   21 natural nests at burrow aprons to assess predation patterns as
   compared to artificial nests. Seventy-two (57\%) of 126 nests were fully
   depredated during the study, and predation rates at artificial and
   natural nests were similar. We identified predators at 48 nests using
   trail cameras; the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) was the
   primary nest predator (69\%). Nests in open sandy areas away from
   burrows exhibited greater daily survival rates (DSR; 0.991 +/- 0.005 SE)
   compared to nests in burrow aprons (active burrow aprons: 0.967 +/-
   0.018; inactive burrow aprons: 0.949 +/- 0.027). Additionally, nests at
   locations burned the year of the study had a lower chance of survival
   (DSR: 0.959 +/- 0.022) than nests at locations burned the previous year
   (DSR: 0.991 +/- 0.005). Management practices that maintain open sandy
   areas (e.g., prescribed fire) away from burrows may increase tortoise
   nest survival. Fire return intervals of >1 year that are implemented
   frequently enough to maintain open sandy areas would be beneficial to

Title = {{Fire and restoration of sagebrush ecosystems}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN}},

Pages = {{177-185}},
Abstract = {{Wildlife managers often resort to prescribed fire to restore sagebrush
   (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems thought to have been affected by fire
   exclusion. However, a fire mosaic of burned and unburned areas may be
   tolerated by certain wildlife but can be detrimental to sagebrush
   obligates. This article assesses evidence about the historical frequency
   and pattern of fire in sagebrush ecosystems and the need forprescribed
   fire. Fire-scar data from nearby forests require adjustment to estimate
   fire rotation, the time required to burn once through a sagebrush
   landscape. Estimates from forests require correction for unburned area
   and because sagebrush burns less often than forests. Recovery time also
   might indicate fire rotation. Mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia
   tridentata ssp. vaseyana) recovers within about 35-100 or more years
   after fire, and Wyoming big sagebrush (A.t. ssp. wyomingensis) requires
   50-120 or more years. Fire rotation in other ecosystems is 2 or more
   times the recovery period. Together, the evidence suggests fire
   rotations may be a minimum of 325-450 years in low sagebrush (A.
   arbuscula), 100-240 years in Wyoming big sagebrush, 70-200 years or more
   in mountain big sagebrush, and 35-100 years in mountain grasslands with
   a little sagebrush. Given these long rotations, fire exclusion likely
   has had little effect in most sagebrush areas. If maintaining and
   restoring habitat for sagebrush-dependent species is the goal, fire
   should be suppressed where there is a threat of cheatgrass (Bromus
   tectorum). Elsewhere, fire does not need to be reintroduced until native
   understory plants can be restored, so that sagebrush ecosystems can
   fully recover from fire.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerating declines in biodiversity worldwide have accentuated the
   need for conservation actions. Unfortunately, the decline is unlikely to
   be reversed by traditional conservation alone, e.g., green tree
   retention at clear-felling and setting aside protected areas for free
   development. Instead the practice of ecological restoration has come to
   play an ever increasing role. Using a before-after control-impact
   experiment in boreal forest voluntary set-asides, we evaluated the
   usefulness of two methods of ecological restoration aimed at promoting
   biodiversity by emulating natural disturbances through restoration
   burning and artificial gap creation involving dead wood creation. In
   burned stands (n = 6) we removed up to 35\% of the standing volume prior
   to burning, and in gap cut stands (n = 10) we removed the cut trees from
   every second gap; harvested trees covered costs for restoration. We used
   saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetles as a proxy for biodiversity to
   evaluate the two restoration methods. We compared species compositions
   of beetles collected with window traps one year before and one year
   after treatment. In addition, we compared catches in the treatments with
   those in untreated reference stands. Before treatment, we found no
   differences between the three groups of stands in terms of overall
   abundance, species richness or species composition. After treatment, the
   overall abundance of beetles was higher in the burned sites compared to
   the reference stands. Overall species richness was higher in burned
   stands compared to references and gap-cut stands. Gap-cut stands had
   higher species richness of cambivores and fire favoured species than
   reference stands. Species composition differed significantly between all
   three groups of stands. Among the 96 species that significantly
   contributed to the differences in species composition, 58 were more
   common in burned stands and 34 more common in gap-cut stands than in the
   other two stand groups. Nineteen of the 96 species are considered to be
   favored by forest fires, and 17 of these fire-favored species were more
   abundant in burned stands than gap-cut stands and/or references. Based
   on our results that burning and gap-cutting changed the beetle
   communities in partly different directions, we propose the use of both
   methods as complements to traditional conservation efforts in future
   attempts to improve conditions for biodiversity in managed boreal forest
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The disturbance regime of boreal forests has been substantially altered

   natural disturbance have become increasingly common as management tools
   to minimize negative effects of forestry on biodiversity. In a
   large-scale habitat-restoration experiment conducted in Norway spruce
   stands in southern Finland, we tested the effects of controlled burning,
   partial harvesting, and increasing the amount of downed wood on ground
   beetles (carabids). We also evaluated the effects of moisture gradients
   within harvested sites. We collected beetles seven years after the
   treatments. The moisture gradient was the strongest determinant of
   carabid assemblages and even after the most intense disturbances, the
   moist patches within sites still supported fauna characteristic of mire
   habitats. The species richness of carabids and the number of
   open-habitat associated species peaked on burned and harvested sites but
   we did not observe a typical pattern in beetle assemblages whereby
   numbers of rare species and species unique to post-disturbance habitats
   were elevated. Our findings suggest that (a) the influx of
   disturbance-associated species was apparently ephemeral and difficult to
   observe seven years post disturbance, and (b) moist patches within
   disturbed sites can serve as refugia for many closed-forest associated
   carabids over the early phases of post-disturbance succession. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Migratory ungulates may be particularly vulnerable to the challenges

   feedbacks between ecological systems and local economies, particularly
   in the agropastoral subsistence economies found in the African savanna
   biome. We used HUMENTS, a spatially realistic socioecological model of
   the Greater Serengeti Ecosystem in East Africa, to explore the potential
   impacts of changing climate and poaching on the migratory wildebeest
   (Connochaetes taurinus) population, the fire regime, and habitat

   Changes in rainfall were predicted to have strong asymmetric effects on

   Conversely, antipoaching had a stronger effect on the ecological portion

   mobile wildlife populations as agents of spatial coupling between the
   human-dominated and natural portions of ecosystems. They also underscore
   the fundamental importance of considering the spatial configuration of

Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem management requires an understanding of how landscapes vary in
   space and time, how this variation can be affected by management
   decisions or stochastic events, and the potential consequences for
   species. Landscape trajectory analysis, coupled with a basic knowledge
   of species habitat selection, offers a straightforward approach to
   ecological risk analysis and can be used to project the effects of
   management decisions on species of concern. The fisher (Martes pennanti)
   occurs primarily in late-successional forests which, in the Sierra
   Nevada mountains, are susceptible to high-intensity wildfire.
   Understanding the effects of fuels treatments and fire on the
   distribution of fisher habitat is a critical conservation concern. We
   assumed that the more a treated landscape resembled occupied female
   fisher home ranges, the more likely it was to be occupied by a female
   and therefore the lower the risk to the population. Thus, we
   characterized important vegetation attributes within the home ranges of
   16 female fishers and used the distribution of these attributes as a
   baseline against which the effects of forest management options could be
   compared. We used principal components analysis to identify the major
   axes defining occupied female fisher home ranges and these, in addition
   to select univariate metrics, became our reference for evaluating the
   effects of landscape change. We demonstrated the approach at two
   management units on the Sierra National Forest by simulating the effects
   of both no action and forest thinning, with and without an unplanned
   fire, on vegetation characteristics over a 45-yr period. Under the no
   action scenario, landscapes remained similar to reference conditions for
   approximately 30-yr until forest succession resulted in a loss of
   landscape heterogeneity. Comparatively, fuel treatment resulted in the
   reduction of certain forest elements below those found in female fisher
   home ranges yet little overall change in habitat suitability. Adding a
   wildfire to both scenarios resulted in divergence from reference
   conditions, though in the no action scenario the divergence was 4 x
   greater and the landscape did not recover within the 45-yr timeframe.
   These examples demonstrate that combining the results of forest growth
   and disturbance modeling with habitat selection data may be used to
   quantify the potential effects of vegetation management activities on
   wildlife habitat. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent low-intensity fires are used in management of Australian
   forests to reduce fuel loads and protect natural resources and human
   property. Low-intensity fires are typically patchy and unburned litter
   microhabitats are often associated with large objects such as logs,
   which may act as refuges both for vertebrate and for invertebrate fauna.
   The aim of this study was to determine whether ants were using unburned
   leaf litter microhabitats associated with logs as a refuge after fire.
   The study was carried out in Bulls Ground State Forest, New South Wales,
   Australia, where experimentally burned and unburned sites had previously
   been established. Species richness and abundance of ants in leaf litter
   did not differ between habitats adjacent to logs and away from logs, in
   burned and unburned sites. Fifteen of the 42 ant species were found in
   all four habitats, and contributed 94\% of total ant abundance. Every
   habitat had a group of unique species, which together made up 30\% of
   the total species richness. There was also a distinct group of species
   that was not found in the leaf litter associated with the burned/open
   habitat. However, as 45\% of all species were found in low abundance
   (less than 10 individuals), care must be taken in inferring patterns for
   these groups. When functional groups were used to assess community
   structure, `cryptic' species were found to be common in all habitats,
   whereas `subordinate Camponotini' were found in burned habitats only.
   This study indicates that in an area where frequent burning is applied
   on a broad scale, preserving a range of microhabitats, including those
   associated with retained logs, may make a substantial contribution to
   conserving ant biodiversity.}},

   (terra firme) forest specialists, we compared home range (HR) use to the
   corresponding availability of 4 main forest types and quantified HR size
   and activity budgets as a function of forest type. HR size varied from
   16 to 60 ha, and saki population density at this scale (12.5 +/- 6.4 SD
   individuals/km(2)) was more closely related to forest type than to group
   size. Although sakis were not obligate habitat specialists, groups
   clearly avoided bamboo forest and preferred terra firme forest. Terra
   firme forests were associated with small HRs, intensive use, high HR
   overlap, and territorial defense, all of which suggest that saki
   densities will be higher in areas dominated by terra firme forest where
   large patches of bamboo (Guadua spp.) are absent. The increased
   desiccation and subsequent forest fires expected in this region from the
   combined impacts of climate change and human land use potentially
   threaten the long-term viability of old-growth terra firme forest

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is commonly used for vegetation management. Whereas
   effects on vegetation are apparent, effects of these burns on
   ground-dwelling invertebrates are not. Land snails are especially
   susceptible to burns. Snail loss occurs directly from burns, but may
   also occur post-burn because of altered habitat conditions, although
   post-burn loss has not previously been tested. We used a field
   experiment to investigate snail survival and factors affecting survival
   in post-burn habitats. We exposed snails (Discidae: Anguispira
   alternata) to combinations of intact leaf litter, wood shelters, burned
   leaf litter, charred wood and ash added to leaf litter, to simulate a
   variety of post-burn conditions. Half of the replicates were watered
   every 3 d, which allowed detection of desiccation effects in comparison
   to ambient water conditions. The on-going drought resulted in high snail
   mortality. Watering increased survival and, as a consequence, growth.
   Snail mortality was higher in habitats with burned leaves and/or wood
   than in unburned habitats. Higher temperatures and rapid initial
   mortality in burned habitats, and increased survival with watering,
   indicated that the major cause of post-fire mortality was desiccation,
   rather than starvation. Contrary to expectations, snails in burned-leaf
   habitats grew more than snails in unburned habitats, and this greater
   growth was associated with higher soil pH. Snails surviving fires in
   burned woodland areas likely have high post-burn mortality. Our
   experiment highlights the negative impacts of burned woodland habitats
   on some nontarget organisms and indicates that prescribed burns should
   be avoided during exceptionally dry conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The invertebrates of the and interior of Western Australia have been

   fire on vegetation in the Gibson Desert, ant species were also collected

   Reserve. The six sites were established in recently burnt and long
   unburnt areas of three main vegetation types: Triodia basedowii
   grassland, Triodia shinzii grassland, and Acacia aneura woodland.
   Twenty-nine ant species occurred exclusively in recently burnt sites, 16
   species were exclusive to the long unburnt sites and the remaining 26
   occurred in both site types. Functional group analyses revealed a
   predominance of Subordinate Camponotini and Opportunists at the long

   were more common in the recently burnt sites. Ant species distribution
   demonstrated only a slight difference between recently burnt and long

   different in terms of both burn and vegetation type (P < 0.05). While
   there are no definite trends for the impact of fire on ants in this

Abstract = {{Restoration of protected areas in boreal forests frequently includes
   creating substantial volumes of dead wood. While this benefits a wide
   range of dead wood dependent invertebrate species, some of these are
   regarded as forest pests. Therefore, the risk of elevated levels of tree
   mortality in surrounding commercial forests must be considered. In a
   large-scale field experiment in southern Finland, we studied the effects
   of restoration treatments on the abundance of bark beetles within and in
   the vicinity of restored areas, in particular focusing on Ips
   typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus. The treatments applied to
   managed Norway spruce forests were controlled burning and partial
   harvesting combined with retaining 5, 30 or 60 m(3)/ha of cut down wood.
   We found that the abundance of bark beetles increased by both burning
   and harvesting with down wood retention, being highest where burning and
   harvesting had been combined. The actual volume of down wood retention
   had no significant effect. The effect of burning on the number of bark
   beetles along host tree boles was negative which suggests that burnt
   spruces provided a less suitable resource for bark beetles than unburnt
   dead spruces. The abundance of bark beetles along host trees also
   decreased with increasing volume of down wood retention. The abundance
   of P. chalographus was slightly elevated up to 50 m outside restored
   areas but the abundance was very low compared to that within the areas.
   The abundance of L typographus was extremely low outside restored areas.
   We conclude that restoration treatments increase the abundance of bark
   beetles via increased availability of resources, but that the effect of
   burning is likely to be counteracted by decreased resource quality.
   Thus, burning might be the ``safest{''} way to produce large quantities
   of dead wood. Furthermore, the fact that only few beetles were collected
   in adjacent areas Suggests that restored areas pose little threat of
   serving as refugia in which bark beetle populations increase in
   sufficient numbers to attack live trees in adjacent forests. However,
   restoration actions repeated at consecutive years within a small area
   might enable the populations to grow to outbreak levels. (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Disturbance is a major source of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. In
   fire-maintained systems, disturbance by fire is often used as a
   management tool to increase biological diversity, restore degraded
   habitats, and reduce pest outbreaks. Much attention has been given to
   how plant communities recover from fire, but relatively few studies have
   examined post-fire responses of higher order species, such as insect
   herbivores. Because dynamic feedbacks occur between plants and their
   consumers, which can in turn influence the response of the entire
   ecosystem, incorporating higher trophic level responses into our
   understanding of the effects of fire is essential. In this study, we
   used structural equation modeling (SEM) to tease apart the direct and
   indirect effects of fire on insect herbivore assemblages found on three
   common oak species in the Florida scrub (Quercus inopina, Q. chapmanii,
   and Q. geminata). We investigated how fire affected herbivore abundance,
   richness, and community composition both directly and indirectly through
   environmental heterogeneity at different spatial scales (e.g., leaf
   quality, plant architecture, and habitat structure). We also
   investigated how seasonality and landscape heterogeneity influenced
   post-fire responses of insect herbivores and whether fire effects on
   herbivore assemblages varied among different host plants. Our general
   findings were that fire effects were (1) largely indirect, mediated
   through habitat structure (although direct fire effects were observed on
   Q. inopina herbivores), (2) non-linear through time due to self-thinning
   processes occurring in the scrub habitat, and (3) varied according to
   herbivore assemblage as a result of differences in the composition of
   species in each herbivore community. To the best of our knowledge, this
   is the first comprehensive study to examine how fire influences the
   assembly of insect herbivore communities through both direct and
   indirect pathways and at multiple spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone regions, many plant species rely on persistent seed banks
   for post-fire recovery. Understanding dormancy and germination cues is,
   therefore, important to predict population response. However, the
   germination ecology of species with physiologically dormant seeds in
   fire-prone regions is complex. We used the endangered species
   Asterolasia buxifolia, from riparian habitat in fire-prone south-eastern
   Australia, to investigate physiologically dormant seeds and their
   response to fire. We assessed whether fire cues alone promoted
   germination, or whether seasonal factors and light also played a role.
   Additionally, we tested the resilience of seeds to heat-shock
   temperatures produced in soil during fire, so as to identify potential
   factors that restrict such species to fire refugia. Seeds germinated
   only at winter seasonal temperatures, and had an obligate smoke and
   light requirement. Heat-shock treatments above 80 degrees C slowed the
   germination rate. Smoke-related germination and the tolerance of A.
   buxifolia seeds to high fire-related temperatures demonstrated that
   recruitment dynamics can be driven by fire; however, germination is
   restricted to winter temperatures. This highlights the potential that
   changes to fire season may have on population persistence. The slow
   germination rate caused by heat, and a light requirement, may contribute
   to restricting this species to riparian habitat.}},

Abstract = {{In the southern Great Plains, the greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus
   cupido) is confined to tallgrass prairie, a habitat now largely
   converted to agriculture. Remaining prairie is highly fragmented and
   subjected to land management practices that greatly alter the ecosystem
   of this species. Chief among these practices are deliberate, large-scale
   spring burns associated with early intensive stocking of cattle. We used
   extensive data to infer how such fires affect the prairie-chicken's
   lekking and nesting behavior. From 1998 to 2000, 60-79.4\% of our study
   area-a 45,000-ha expanse of tallgrass prairie in north-central
   Oklahoma-was burned in spring. Prairie-chickens tended to lek on
   unburned areas but not in a pattern that differed from random habitat
   choice. Leks on burns tended to be < 200 m from unburned prairie.
   Females strongly avoided nesting in areas burned in spring 1998 and 1999
   (n > 25 nests/y). Nesting effort was poor in 2000, prohibiting
   statistical analysis, but 5 of 8 nests were on unburned prairie.
   Incorporating data from 1997 (n = 12 nests), only 14 of 74 nests were
   placed on burned prairie, and only 5 of the 64 nests from 1998 to 2000
   were located on prairie burned all three of those years. Avoidance of
   burns was particularly strong before June. Despite strong avoidance,
   nest success did not differ between burned or unburned prairie. Our
   findings raise two concerns: 1) if leks are established only < 200 m
   from unburned prairie, then an increase in the proportion of burns may
   inhibit lek formation, and, more important, 2) if females avoid nesting
   on recent burns, then an increase in the proportion of burns may cause a
   female to concentrate nesting effort on small patches (or forego
   nesting). We recommend moderation of spring burning (e. g., patch
   burning) of tallgrass prairie, lest the greater prairie-chicken be
   driven further from its already piecemeal habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain pine beetle (MPB) has become an invasive forest pest of mature
   pine in western North America as it spreads beyond its former endemic
   range. Management actions such as timber harvest can reduce the spread
   of MPB but may affect species of conservation concern like woodland
   caribou. Our goal was to inform MPB management within caribou ranges by
   exploring the impacts of MPB on caribou habitat-focusing on terrestrial
   lichens, an important winter food for caribou. We evaluated differences
   in lichen cover among four MPB management actions: timber harvest,
   wildfires, leaving MPB killed trees as-is, and single-tree cut-and-burn
   control. We found little evidence that leaving MPB killed trees as-is or
   controlling MPB using single-tree cut-and-burn impacted lichen cover.
   However, we found that lichen cover was lower in timber harvested and
   burned areas compared to intact undisturbed forest but only 10 to 20
   years post-disturbance, respectively. Our results suggest that despite
   short-term reductions in lichen cover, using timber harvesting and
   prescribed burns to control MPB may balance management needs for MPB
   while maintaining lichen cover over time. However, using timber
   harvesting and prescribed burns to manage MPB is likely to have
   detrimental population-level effects on caribou by increasing the
   proportion of disturbed habitat and thus predators within caribou
   ranges. Among the four management actions that we evaluated, the
   cut-and-burn control program balances the need to limit the spread of
   MPB while also limiting negative impacts on caribou food. Our work
   addresses some of the challenges of managing competing forest and
   ecosystem values by evaluating the consequence of forest pest management
   actions on an important food resource for a species-at-risk.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances of varying frequency and intensity shape the species
   composition, stand structure, and functions of forests. This study
   assessed the frequency and distribution of disturbances caused by eight
   agents (insects, diseases, fire, animals, weather, other vegetation,
   human, and unknown) in the forests of the southeastern United States
   from 1995 to 2018. We used data from 88,722 inventory measurements of
   33,531 plots from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis database to
   assess disturbance among different forest types and to different canopy
   strata. Disturbances were detected in approximately 14 percent of the
   plots, located mostly in pine-dominated forest types. Fire was the most
   frequent disturbance agent (occurring 6 percent of the time), followed
   by weather and animal agents. The agents that caused the highest
   mortality rate during the period for saplings were silvicultural
   treatments (8.6 percent), other vegetation (5.6 percent), and fire (4.4
   percent), whereas for trees they were silvicultural treatments (9.8
   percent), weather (1.9 percent) and insects (1.7 percent). The forest
   type that appeared to have been most affected by disturbances was
   longleaf-slash pine of the Coastal Plain. These results are useful for
   understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of disturbance events in
   different southeastern forest types and locations and for guiding forest
   management activities to mitigate potential impacts.
   Study Implications: This study examined the spatiotemporal variation in
   the occurrence of eight disturbance agents across the forest types of
   the southeastern United States. Forest managers can benefit from these
   results to plan for appropriate treatments for maintaining and restoring
   ecosystem resilience and function. We recommend a natural
   disturbance-based management approach that embraces and emulates the
   effect of natural disturbances, such as frequent and low-severity fires,
   moderate ice accumulations, and intermediate-scale winds. Foresters can
   use the results from our study as well as additional data and
   information to understand the disturbance regime of their forest type,
   physiographic region, or state and decide on whether to implement any
   silvicultural treatment. For example, since the observed frequency of
   damage because of suppression of overtopped trees, competition, and
   smothering by vines in large tree diameter stands of longleaf-slash pine
   in Alabama and Georgia was significantly higher than expected, control
   of undesired trees and vines through mechanical and chemical methods and
   use of prescribed fires would be an appropriate prescription for these
   stands. Recommendations for stands managed for objectives such as
   wildlife habitat or recreation would be different from those for stands
   being used primarily for timber production.}},

   before and after burning the firebreaks that surround the enclosure.
   Trap success was exceptionally high, and the field work is suspected to
   have coincided with a Mastomys population explosion. This genus
   dominated the small mammal communities before and after the burn, and
   never disappeared from the burnt patches. Its numbers also did not crash
   directly after the burn, as have been reported in most other studies.
   Movement from the burnt areas was observed, which may have had a
   significant impact on the numbers of rodents caught both inside the
   enclosure and in the more natural areas outside. Our study suggests that
   fire can be investigated as a tool to keep rodent densities down in
   areas where they are nuisance animals, especially when used in
   conjunction with models that forecast outbreaks of Mastomys. It also

Abstract = {{Refuges for threatened species are important to prevent species
   extinction. They provide protection from a range of environmental and
   biotic stressors, and ideally provide protection against all threatening
   processes. However, for some species it may not be clear why some areas
   are refuges and others are not. The forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus
   quadragintus) is an endangered, sedentary, cryptic and specialised bird
   endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. Having undergone an
   extreme range contraction over the past century the species is now
   mostly confined to a few small offshore island refuges. Key threatening
   processes to the species include habitat loss, wildfire, competition and
   predation. The ways in which these processes have molded the species'
   contemporary range have not been clearly evaluated. Furthermore, the
   security of the remnant population within refuges is uncertain. To
   overcome this uncertainty we assessed key threats and established the
   population status in known refuges by developing a robust survey
   protocol within an occupancy modelling framework. We discuss our results
   in the context of planning trial reintroductions of this endangered
   species in suitable habitat across its former range. We found very high
   occupancy rates (0.75-0.96) at two refuges and in suitable conditions,
   the species was highly detectable (p, 0.43-0.77). At a third location
   our surveys indicated a local extinction, likely due to recent wildfire.
   We demonstrate that all refuges are at high risk of one or more
   threatening processes and the current distribution across island refuges
   is unlikely to secure the species from extinction. We identified large
   areas of potential habitat across the species' former mainland range,
   but these are likely too distant from source populations for natural
   recolonisation. We propose that establishing new populations of
   forty-spotted pardalotes via reintroduction is essential to secure the
   species and that this is best achieved while robust source populations
   still exist.}},

Abstract = {{The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), a species that is federally endangered
   in the U.S., is being impacted by white-nose syndrome and habitat loss
   across much of its range. A better understanding of summer roost ecology
   of the species will enable us to develop management strategies that
   promote summer survival for breeding adult females and their pups. We
   conducted a 5 year investigation of Indiana bat roost habitat selection
   and roosting behavior in a large (>250,000 ha) forested area of the
   southern Appalachian Mountains and compared our results to populations
   in different landscapes across the species' range. From May to August
   2008-2012, we attached radio transmitters to 50 adult females, 3
   juveniles, and 7 adult males captured at sites on the Cherokee and
   Nantahala national forests and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We
   radiotracked bats to 95 roosts and measured characteristics of trees,
   0.1 ha plots, and landscape attributes for 69 of these roosts and
   associated random trees. We used an AIC approach to compare 14 candidate
   conditional logistic regression models. The only plausible model, which
   carried 95\% of total model weights, had 3 important terms. Indiana bats
   showed strong selection for yellow pine (Pinus subgenus Diploxylon)
   snags that were significantly taller than random trees and in areas with
   a greater number of snags within 0.1 ha. During this study, tree and
   stand structure were more important for roost selection than larger
   scale factors and Indiana bats responded to a pulsed and highly
   ephemeral resource, dead yellow pines, which were a significant
   component of the large forest tracts. Roosting behavior differed from
   what has been observed for Indiana bats in other parts of the eastern
   U.S.: maternity colonies tended to be smaller (<25 bats, but as large as
   75 bats prior to pups being volant) and bats were more nomadic, using
   each roost tree for only 2-3 days on average and rarely for more than
   one year. The differences we observed in roosting behavior in the
   southern Appalachians suggest it would be wise to consider the broader
   landscape context when evaluating the roosting ecology of Indiana bats,
   as local forest types and disturbance events will affect stand structure
   and roost tree availability. Stand and landscape-scale management
   practices that create or preserve large pine snags, such as prescribed
   fire, coupled with natural or manmade pulsed disturbances, should aid in
   the management and recovery of the Indiana bat in this region. (C) 2017

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Closed-canopy upland hardwood stands often lack diverse understory
   structure and composition, limiting available nutrition for white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as well as nesting and foraging structure
   for other wildlife. Various regeneration methods can positively
   influence understory development; however, non-commercial strategies are
   needed to improve available nutrition in many stands, as some contain
   timber that is not ready to harvest and others are owned by landowners
   who are not interested in harvesting timber. Applications of herbicide
   and prescribed fire have improved availability of food and cover for
   deer and other wildlife in pine (Pinus spp.) systems. However, this
   strategy has not been evaluated in hardwood systems. To evaluate the
   influence of fire and herbicide treatments on available deer forage in
   upland hardwood systems, we measured forage availability and calculated
   nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) at 14\% crude protein mixed diet,
   following 7 silvicultural treatments, including controls, in 4 mixed
   upland hardwood stands July-September 2007 and 2008. We compared NCC
   among forest treatments and within 4 paired warm-season forage food
   plots to evaluate the usefulness of food plots in areas where forests
   are managed. Nutritional carrying capacity estimates (deer days/ha) were
   greatest following canopy reduction with prescribed fire treatments in
   both years. Understory herbicide application did not affect species
   composition or NCC 1 year or 2 years post-treatment. Production of
   forage plantings exceeded that of forest treatments both years with the
   exception of early-maturing soybeans and retention cut with fire 2 years
   post-treatment. We encourage land managers to use canopy reducing
   treatments and low-intensity prescribed fire to increase available
   nutrition and improve available cover where needed in upland hardwood
   systems. In areas where deer density may limit understory development,
   high-quality forage food plots may be used to buffer browsing while
   strategies to reduce deer density and stimulate the forest understory
   are implemented. (c) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{The harvest of plant parts and exudates from wild populations
   contributes to the income, food security and livelihoods of many
   millions of people worldwide. Frankincense, an aromatic resin sourced
   from natural populations of Boswellia trees and shrubs, has been
   cherished by world societies for centuries. Boswellia populations are
   threatened by over-exploitation and ecosystem degradation, jeopardizing
   future resin production. Here, we reveal evidence of population collapse
   of B. papyrifera- now the main source of frankincense-throughout its
   geographic range. Using inventories of 23 populations consisting of
   21,786 trees, growth-ring data from 202 trees and demographic models on
   the basis of 7,246 trees, we find that over 75\% of studied populations
   lack small trees, natural regeneration has been absent for decades, and
   projected frankincense production will be halved in 20 yr. These changes
   are caused by increased human population pressure on Boswellia woodlands
   through cattle grazing, frequent burns and reckless tapping. A
   literature review showed that other Boswellia species experience similar
   threats. Populations can be restored by establishing cattle exclosures
   and fire-breaks, and by planting trees and tapping trees more carefully.
   Concerted conservation and restoration efforts are urgently needed to
   secure the long-term availability of this iconic product.}},

Abstract = {{We used pitfall traps to study the effects of fire and salvage logging

Abstract = {{Fuel management techniques are commonly used in shrublands to reduce
   wildfire risk. However, more information about the ecological effects of
   these treatments is needed by managers and ecologists. In an effort to
   address this need, we performed a replicated (4 replicates per
   treatment) 48-ha experiment in northern California chaparral dominated
   by Adenostoma fasciculatum to determine the effects of two fuel
   reduction types (prescribed fire and mastication) and three different
   seasons of treatment (fall, winter, and spring) on shrub cover, height,
   and seedling density. Exclosures (2.5 m(2) each) were also used to
   assess herbivory effects. By the third post-treatment year, prescribed
   fire treatments had higher shrub cover (71 +/- A 2\%) than mastication
   (43 +/- A 4\%). There was no treatment effect on shrub height, species
   richness, or composition. Seedling density was initially higher in
   prescribed fire treatments (31 +/- A 4 seedlings m(-2)) than mastication
   (3 +/- A 0 seedlings m(-2)); however, prescribed fire treatments
   experienced substantial mortality, especially spring burning, resulting
   in lower densities 3 years after treatments (18 +/- A 0 seedlings m(-2)
   after fall and winter fire compared to 2 +/- A 0 seedlings m(-2) after
   spring fire). A. fasciculatum remained the dominant shrub species after
   the treatments, and Ceanothus cuneatus recruitment was higher in fall
   burning. Deer herbivory only affected shrub height, especially in
   masticated units, resulting in heights of 55 +/- A 2 cm in unexclosed
   areas compared to 66 +/- A 4 cm inside exclosures by the third
   post-treatment year. Overall, our findings suggest that fuel treatments
   play an important role in shrubland community dynamics, at least in the
   short-term, with implications for re-treatment frequency, community
   structure, and wildlife habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary forests are an increasingly common feature in tropical
   landscapes worldwide and understanding their regeneration is necessary
   to design effective restoration strategies. It has previously been shown
   that the woody species community in secondary forests can follow
   different successional pathways according to the nature of past human
   activities in the area, yet little is known about patterns of herbaceous
   species diversity in secondary forests with different histories of land
   use. We compared the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plant
   communities in two types of Central Amazonian secondary forests-those
   regenerating on pastures created by felling and burning trees and those
   where trees were felled only. We also tested if plant density and
   species richness in secondary forests are related to proximity to
   primary forest. In comparison with primary forest sites, forests
   regenerating on non-burned habitats had lower herbaceous plant density
   and species richness than those on burned ones. However, species
   composition and abundance in non-burned stands were more similar to
   those of primary forest, whereas several secondary forest specialist
   species were found in burned stands. In both non-burned and burned
   forests, distance from the forest edge was not related to herbaceous
   density and species richness. Overall, our results suggest that the
   natural regeneration of herbaceous species in secondary tropical forests
   is dependent on a site's post-clearing treatment. We recommend
   evaluating the land history of a site prior to developing and
   implementing a restoration strategy, as this will influence the
   biological template on which restoration efforts are overlaid.}},

   Arthropods were sampled in overstory trees by climbing and bagging

   Arthropod assemblages showed significant differences among tree species

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wildlife habitat use is the result of behaviors that occur at multiple
   spatial and temporal scales. The interactions between these behaviors
   can often result in complex patterns of selection that can make it
   challenging to select the most appropriate scale to implement management
   actions. Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido), a declining
   grassland grouse species, face many conservation challenges throughout
   its distribution, including increased fragmentation from anthropogenic
   activities (e.g., energy development and altered disturbance regimes).
   However, much of the literature on this species has focused on a narrow
   portion of its lifecycle, specifically the breeding season. We examined
   habitat use of female Greater Prairie-Chickens in a grassland that is
   managed with prescribed fire and grazing and that has also undergone
   considerable development for oil and gas production. We developed
   discrete choice models for four behaviorally distinct life-history
   stages and two spatial scales to evaluate how rangeland management,
   energy development, and scale influence habitat use throughout the
   annual cycle. Additionally, we used cumulative distribution functions to
   determine response distances to landscape features. We found that time
   since fire, proximity to woodlands and proximity of lek sites were the
   most consistent predictors of habitat use during most periods and
   spatial scales. Greater Prairie-Chickens consistently avoided woodlands
   and remained relatively close to lek sites during all parts of the year.
   Selection of time since fire varied through the year with Greater
   Prairie-Chickens primarily using unburned patches in the lekking and
   nesting season and recently burned patches in the post-nesting and
   nonbreeding season. Greater Prairie-Chickens demonstrated a seasonally
   variable response to energy development, avoiding power lines and areas
   with a high densities of oil wells by as much as 300-600 m in the
   lekking, post-nesting, and nonbreeding season. Management actions that
   promote vegetation heterogeneity will benefit Greater PrairieChickens by
   creating a variety of seral stages used during different life stages,
   but efforts should be made to limit future fragmentation of grasslands
   by energy development.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction has been identified as one of the main threats to
   biodiversity. Among all factors causing habitat disturbance, wildfire is
   recognized as one of the most important ecological forces that
   influences not only the physical environment, but also the structure and
   composition of floral and faunal communities. These processes are often
   translated in population bottlenecks, which occur frequently in
   threatened species and result in loss of genetic diversity and
   evolutionary potential. In this study, we analyzed the genetic
   consequences of a demographic bottleneck produced by a forest fire that
   reduced the population of the endangered blue chaffinch (Fringilla
   teydea polatzeki), which inhabits the island of Gran Canaria, to
   approximately 122 individuals. Analysis of nine micro-satellite loci
   revealed that, while a decline in census was observed during the
   bottleneck, there was no observed excess of heterozygosity or evidence
   of a decline in allelic richness, two characteristic bottleneck
   signatures. On the contrary, we observed that the Gran Canaria blue
   chaffinch has retained significant levels of genetic diversity and shows
   no evidence of an increased level of inbreeding (F-IS) either before or
   after the bottleneck. The results from this study have important

Abstract = {{A survey of birds and mammals in Paspalum quadrifarium grasslands
   managed with fire, located in Beunos Aires Province, Argentina, was
   performed. Relative abundances of birds and micromammals, their habitat
   relations and fire effects, were studied with the aim of providing
   information for a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study
   area has a sustainable management of this ecosystem. The study area had
   a patchy structure, constituted by three principal habitats: tall-grass
   (mostly P. quadrifarium), short-grass (Distichlis sp., Botriochloa sp.,
   Stenotaphrum sp., Stipa sp. y Mentha sp.) and marsh (Solanum sp.).
   Thirty five of the 39 bird species registered in these grasslands,
   mainly were found in habitats where p. quadrifarium was predominant.
   Thirteen of these species showed a strong dependence on P. quadrifarium
   for food, refuge and nesting requirements mainly (Spartonica maluroides,
   Asthenes hudsoni, Cranioleuca sulphurifera y Cistothorus platensis).
   Fifteen mammals species were registered. Among micormammals, 3 rodents
   (Oxymyxterus rutilans, Oryzomys flavescens, Akodon azarae) and the small
   opossum Monodelphis dimidiata were the more strongly related to the P.
   quadrifarium grassland. A preliminary account of the effects of grazing
   after fire, in an experimentally burned area, showed an absence of
   micromammal captures and a replacement of bird species linked to P.
   quadrifarium by species that prefer short grasslands (Vanellus
   chilensis, Milvago chimango, Anthus correndera). Finally, we emphasize
   the importance of considering the fauna in the management of this
   agroecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important factor driving the position and stability of
   ecotones between fire-prone and less flammable forest types. To better
   understand, the recruitment processes that mediate plant persistence in
   ecotonal systems, we used manipulative field experiments in Australian
   wet eucalypt forests to investigate factors that may be regulating
   seedling recruitment and survival in burnt and unburnt forest. We found
   no evidence that safe sites from predators or exposure regulated
   seedling recruitment in three of the four study species, but one species
   associated with less flammable rainforest systems had increased
   germination rates in response to soil scarification. Seedlings of all
   four study species experienced higher rates of mortality resulting from
   herbivory or water stress in the post-fire environment. We found that
   intact ground cover increased seedling survival by reducing exposure to
   dessicating conditions and providing refuge from vertebrate herbivores.
   Our results suggest that shrubs associated with mesic, low-flammability
   forests have fewer opportunities for recruitment with desiccation risks
   in post-fire environments limiting seedling survival. In contrast,
   shrubs associated with high-flammability forests were capable of
   recruiting and surviving in both burnt and unburnt forests. Post-fire
   recruitment is likely to be more abundant after fire than at other
   times, but we found that survival can be highly constrained by post-fire
   herbivory. The ability of these species to recruit in undisturbed
   conditions provides some insurance against recruitment failure under
   stochastic variation in herbivory and desiccating conditions. The
   capacity to spread risks could be important in maintaining boundary
   position and diversity in these ecotonal systems.}},

Abstract = {{The boreal forests of Alberta have extensive networks of legacy seismic
   exploration lines that have been linked to the decline of boreal
   woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations throughout the
   region. In order to improve habitat quality for caribou, energy
   companies are investing significant resources in the restoration of many
   of these seismic lines in key areas, however, frequent large and intense
   wildfires may compromise the effectiveness of these conservation
   measures. To minimize the wildfire risk, managers need to know the
   likelihood of wildfire and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. We
   undertook a wildfire risk assessment across the Cold Lake caribou range
   where we used the Burn-P3 model to determine: a) burn probability; b)
   wildfire risk to restored seismic line areas; and c) the effectiveness
   of mitigation measures. The burn probability of the landscape was highly
   heterogeneous, and recent large burns and some waterbodies provided
   ``shields{''} that reduced burn probability on their leeward sides. We
   designed mitigation scenarios to mimic the shielding effect of
   waterbodies and large recent burns by modeling the effects of increase
   suppression activity and fuel conversion within intensive management
   zones upwind of the resources to be protected. We found that these
   intensive management zones reduced the burn probability and wildfire
   hazard in the restored habitat areas but the effect declined rapidly as
   distance from the treatment zones increased. If land managers want to
   minimize the risk of losing their investments in caribou conservation to
   wildfire, it would be preferable to have mitigation measures spatially
   targeted closer to the conservation areas. Furthermore, it would be
   advisable to have redundancy in any conservation measures and
   wildfire-risk mitigations to ensure that losses due to wildfire on one
   area do not jeopardize all conservation projects within the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire and timber harvest are anthropogenic disturbances that
   modify resource availability and ecosystem structure, and can affect
   wildlife both directly and indirectly. Terrestrial salamanders are
   effective indicators of forest health due to their high abundance and
   sensitivity to microclimatic conditions. Given their ecological
   importance, it is critical to understand how forest salamanders respond
   to management-related disturbances. We predicted that timber harvest and
   prescribed fire would decrease salamander abundance and availability,
   and increase salamander cover object use. We surveyed for southern
   red-backed salamanders (Plethodon serratus) over 9 sampling periods from
   2010 to 2014 in a Missouri Ozark (USA) forest, and used binomial mixture
   models to estimate abundance and detectability in a large-scale
   Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) experiment. Five replicate 5-ha
   units were randomly assigned to each treatment (prescribed burn,
   shelterwood harvest, midstory herbicide) and control. We compared
   abundance, surface activity, detectability, and microhabitat use among
   treatments. Abundance and surface activity decreased post-treatment in
   shelterwood, midstory, and burn units. Abundance estimates in midstory
   and burn units rebounded in the second post-treatment year but declined
   further in shelterwood harvest units. Overall, treatments had stronger
   effects on salamander availability than on actual abundance. We also
   found a higher proportion of salamanders under cover objects after
   prescribed fire, further illustrating the importance of accounting for
   imperfect detectability. Our findings foster a more robust understanding
   of the mechanisms underlying population-level responses to management
   practices, ultimately increasing our ability to manage terrestrial
   salamanders effectively. Published 2015. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {{The primary objective of many longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)
   restoration programs is to enhance or restore habitat for wildlife
   dependent on herbaceous plant communities. Because herbaceous cover is
   inversely related to canopy cover, restoration programs often place
   restrictions on longleaf pine planting density. However, the influence
   of planting density on understory plant communities has been
   inadequately evaluated. Therefore, we initiated a study to examine the
   relative influences of planting density and other factors on overall
   understory composition and forage availability for white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) in
   nine longleaf pine stands throughout the Coastal Plain of Alabama during
   2017-2018. We found that coverage of herbaceous plants decreased 3.5\%,
   coverage of woody plants decreased 2.4\%, and coverage of northern
   bobwhite forage plants decreased 1.9\% for each 1 m(2)/ha increase in
   longleaf pine basal area. However, planting density was not a
   significant predictor of current basal area, nor coverage of any
   functional group of plants we examined, likely because current longleaf
   pine density averaged only 46\% (range = 30-64\%) of seedling planting
   density. We did not detect an effect of prescribed fire on stand
   condition or understory plant communities, likely due to variability in
   fire timing and frequency. Our findings related to planting density were
   likely a function of low longleaf pine survival, which is not uncommon.
   Because of this and the inherent variability in growth rates for young
   longleaf pine stands, restoration programs should consider placing
   greater emphasis on post-planting monitoring and management than
   planting density.}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-97}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis spp. occidentalis Hook.)
   woodlands are rapidly replacing lower elevation (< 2100 m) quaking aspen
   (Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands throughout the northern Great Basin.
   Aspen restoration is important because these communities provide
   critical habitat for many wildlife species and contain a high diversity
   of understory shrubs and herbaceous species. We studied two juniper
   removal treatments to restore aspen woodlands. Treatments included
   cutting one-third of the juniper trees followed by early fall burning
   (FALL) or early spring burning (SPRING). Selective cutting of juniper
   was performed to increase cured surface (0-2 m) fuel levels to carry
   fire through the woodlands. We tested treatment effectiveness at
   removing juniper from seedlings to mature trees, measured aspen sucker
   recruitment, and evaluated the response to treatment of shrub and
   herbaceous cover and diversity. In the FALL treatment, burning
   eliminated all remaining juniper trees and seedlings, stimulated a
   6-fold increase in aspen suckering (10 000 ha(-1)), but initially
   resulted in a significant reduction in herbaceous cover. Spring burning
   removed 80\% of the mature juniper trees that remained after cutting.
   However, 50\% of juniper juveniles survived the SPRING treatment, which
   will permit juniper to redominate these stands in less than 80 years.
   Aspen suckering in the SPRING increased only 2.5-fold to 5 300 stems
   ha(-1) by the third year after fire. In the SPRING, herbaceous cover
   increased 330\% and the number of species observed doubled by the third
   year after fire. If the management objective is to eliminate western
   juniper with minimal cutting and stimulate greater aspen suckering, we
   recommend that woodlands be burned in the fall. If the objective is to
   maintain shrub and herbaceous cover and moderately increase aspen
   suckering, spring burning is recommended. With spring burning it appears
   follow-up management will be necessary to remove juniper that are missed
   in initial treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Weather is a general stochastic influence on the life history of weeds.
   In contrast, anthropogenic disturbance (e.g. land use) is an important
   deterministic influence on weed demography. Our aim with this study was
   to investigate the relative contributions of land use and weather on the
   demography of Lantana camara (lantana), a weed of agricultural and
   natural habitats, based on the intensive monitoring of lantana
   populations under three land uses (viz. farm{[}pasture], and burnt and
   grazed forests) in subtropical Australia. Lantana populations were
   growing vigorously across all land uses (asymptotic population growth
   rate, lambda > 3). Examination of historical demography using
   retrospective perturbation analyses showed that weather was a strong
   influence on lantana demography with the transition from an El Nino
   (2008-09) to a La Nina (2009-10) year having a strong positive effect on
   population growth rate. This effect was most marked at the grazed site,
   and to a lesser extent at the burnt site, with seedling-to-juvenile and
   juvenile-to-adult transitions contributing most to these effects. This
   is likely the result of burning and grazing having eliminated/reduced
   interspecific competition at these sites. Prospective perturbation
   analyses revealed that lambda was most sensitive to proportionate
   changes in growth transitions, followed by fecundity and survival
   transitions. Examination of context-specific patterns in elasticity
   revealed that growth and fecundity transitions are likely to be the more
   critical vital rates to reduce lambda in wet years at the burnt and
   grazed forest sites, compared to the farm/pasture site. Management of
   lantana may need to limit the transition of juveniles into the adult
   stages, especially in sites where lantana is free from competition (e.g.
   in the presence of fire or grazing), and this particularly needs to be
   achieved in wet years. Collectively, these results shed light on aspects
   of spatial and temporal variation in the demography of lantana, and
   offer insights on its context-specific management.}},

Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Conifer populations appear disproportionately threatened by
   global change. Most examples are, however, drawn from the northern
   hemisphere and long-term rates of population decline are not well
   documented as historical data are often lacking. We use a large and
   long-term (1931-2013) repeat photography dataset together with
   environmental data and fire records to account for the decline of the
   critically endangered Widdringtonia cedarbergensis. Eighty-seven
   historical and repeat photo-pairs were analysed to establish 20th
   century changes in W. cedarbergensis demography. A generalized linear
   mixed-effects model was fitted to determine the relative importance of
   environmental factors and fire-return interval on mortality for the
   species.
   Results: From an initial total of 1313 live trees in historical
   photographs, 74\% had died and only 44 (3.4\%) had recruited in the
   repeat photographs, leaving 387 live individuals. Juveniles (mature
   adults) had decreased (increased) from 27\% (73\%) to 8\% (92\%) over
   the intervening period. Our model demonstrates that mortality is related
   to greater fire frequency, higher temperatures, lower elevations, less
   rocky habitats and aspect (i.e. east-facing slopes had the least
   mortality).
   Conclusions: Our results show that W. cedarbergensis populations have
   declined significantly over the recorded period, with a pronounced
   decline in the last 30 years. Individuals that established in open
   habitats at lower, hotter elevations and experienced a greater fire
   frequency appear to be more vulnerable to mortality than individuals
   growing within protected, rocky environments at higher, cooler locations
   with less frequent fires. Climate models predict increasing temperatures
   for our study area (and likely increases in wildfires). If these
   predictions are realised, further declines in the species can be
   expected. Urgent management interventions, including seedling
   out-planting in fire-protected high elevation sites, reducing fire
   frequency in higher elevation populations, and assisted migration,
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Aim An interaction between reduced habitat structural complexity and
   predation by feral cats (Felis catus) has been hypothesized as the
   primary driver of mammal decline in northern Australia. However, we have
   a limited understanding of the drivers of the distribution and abundance
   of feral cats at a landscape scale, including whether the occurrence of
   a top predator, the dingo (Canis familiaris {[}dingo]), limits feral cat
   populations. We modelled feral cat and dingo site occurrence, to provide
   the first broad-scale assessment of their distributional patterns and
   co-occurrence within monsoonal Australia.
   Location About 370,000 km(2) of monsoonal area in the Northern
   Territory.
   Methods We surveyed 376 sites using camera traps. We used single- and
   two-species occupancy models to investigate feral cat and dingo site
   occurrence and the influence of dingoes on feral cat occupancy. We
   included predictor variables that relate to hypotheses of predator
   occurrence, including both environmental and disturbance-related
   variables.
   Results Feral cat occurrence and dingo occurrence were best predicted by
   indices of habitat structural complexity; feral cat occurrence declined
   with increasing productivity, except in areas of relatively high fire
   activity (fire frequency and extent), and dingo occurrence declined with
   terrain ruggedness. We found no evidence that dingoes are spatially
   limiting feral cat occurrence.
   Main conclusions Our findings suggest the protection and enhancement of
   habitat structural complexity at both the local and landscape scale
   could enable conservation managers to reduce the exposure of small- and
   medium-sized mammals to feral cats and dingoes. This can most likely be
   achieved through improved fire and feral herbivore management, which is
   a more feasible management option than lethal predator control.}},

Abstract = {{In the southern Rocky Mountains, current mountain pine beetle
   (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks and associated harvesting
   have set millions of hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var.
   latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.) forest onto new stand development
   trajectories. Information about immediate, post-disturbance tree
   regeneration will provide insight on dynamics of future stand
   composition and structure. We compared tree regeneration in eight paired
   harvested and untreated lodgepole pine stands in the Fraser Experimental
   Forest that experienced more than 70\% overstory mortality due to
   beetles. New seedlings colonized both harvested and untreated stands in
   the first years after the beetle outbreak. In harvested areas the
   density of new seedlings, predominantly lodgepole pine and aspen, was
   four times higher than in untreated stands. Annual height growth of pine
   and fir advance regeneration (e.g., trees established prior to the onset
   of the outbreak) has doubled following overstory mortality in untreated
   stands. Growth simulations based on our regeneration data suggest that
   stand basal area and stem density will return to pre-beetle levels in
   untreated and harvested stands within 80-105 years. Furthermore,
   lodgepole pine will remain the dominant species in harvested stands over
   the next century, but subalpine fir will become the most abundant
   species in untreated areas. Owing to terrain, economic and
   administrative limitations, active management will treat a small
   fraction (<15\%) of the forests killed by pine beetle. Our findings
   suggest that the long-term consequences of the outbreak will be most
   dramatic in untreated forests where the shift in tree species
   composition will influence timber and water production, wildfire
   behavior, wildlife habitat and other forest attributes. Published by

   site in the Alaskan boreal forest. Forest management in the region
   sought historically to increase spruce composition after harvest through
   silvicultural practices such as site preparation and assisted
   regeneration; however, successful reforestation requires the effects of
   these practices to persist over time and control non-target tree
   species. In order to identify the enduring effects of silvicultural
   regeneration practices, we sampled a large (26.7 ha) white spruce
   regeneration trial established immediately following a stand replacing
   wildfire and subsequent salvage harvest in a productive upland forest.
   The original regeneration treatments followed a split-split plot
   experimental design on two landform types (LF), four ground
   scarification treatments (GST) plus a non-scarified control, and five
   artificial white spruce regeneration treatments (WSRT) plus a natural
   seedfall control (Densmore et al., 1999). Here we analyze the total
   biomass, stand density, and basal area for all tree species within each
   of the regeneration treatments 28 years post-establishment, and
   calculate seed dispersal distances. Our results show that compared to
   natural seedfall control plots, white spruce basal area was six times
   greater in planted seedling plots, and white spruce stem density (dbh >=
   1.0 cm) was nearly three times greater in broadcast seeding plots. White
   spruce stem density from natural seedfall averaged 944 stems ha(-1), but
   was dependent on both topographic position and distance to
   wind-dispersed seed sources. Our results also indicate that GST had few
   significant effects on white spruce basal area or stem density. However,
   scarification nearly doubled Alaska birch (Betula neoalaskana Sarg.)
   stem density and basal area compared to non-scarified control plots.
   Planted white spruce plots supported 19\% less birch basal area, except
   in the most intensive scarification treatments in which birch basal area
   did not differ. Intensive scarification reduced quaking aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) basal area by half on slope plots. Our results
   demonstrate that early regeneration practices profoundly influence stand
   development beyond the stem initiation stage, but pre-fire stand type,
   post-fire configuration of unburned seed sources, and topographical
   variation play a mediating role in determining species assemblages and
   competitive relationships. A fire-killed stand must be considered within
   its ecological and landscape context to determine the probable success
   of a management action such as salvage and tree regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Florida scrub-jays Aphelocoma coerulescens are listed as threatened
   under the Endangered Species Act due to loss and degradation of scrub
   habitat. This study concerned the development of an optimal strategy for
   the restoration and management of scrub habitat at Merritt Island
   National Wildlife Refuge, which contains one of the few remaining large
   populations of scrub-jays in Florida. There are documented differences
   in the reproductive and survival rates of scrub-jays among discrete
   classes of scrub height (<120 cm or ``short{''}; 120-170 cm or
   ``optimal{''}; >170 cm or ``tall{''}; and a combination of tall and
   optimal or ``mixed{''}), and our objective was to calculate a
   state-dependent management strategy that would maximize the long-term
   growth rate of the resident scrub-jay population. We used aerial imagery
   with multistate Markov models to estimate annual transition
   probabilities among the four scrub-height classes under three possible
   management actions: scrub restoration (mechanical cutting followed by
   burning), a prescribed burn, or no intervention. A strategy prescribing
   the optimal management action for management units exhibiting different
   proportions of scrub-height classes was derived using dynamic
   programming. Scrub restoration was the optimal management action only in
   units dominated by mixed and tall scrub, and burning tended to be the
   optimal action for intermediate levels of short scrub. The optimal
   action was to do nothing when the amount of short scrub was greater than
   30\%, because short scrub mostly transitions to optimal height scrub
   (i.e., that state with the highest demographic success of scrub-jays) in
   the absence of intervention. Monte Carlo simulation of the optimal
   policy suggested that some form of management would be required every
   year. We note, however, that estimates of scrub-height transition
   probabilities were subject to several sources of uncertainty, and so we
   explored the management implications of alternative sets of transition
   probabilities. Generally, our analysis demonstrated the difficulty of
   managing for a species that requires midsuccessional habitat, and
   suggests that innovative management tools may be needed to help ensure
   the persistence of scrub-jays at Merritt Island National Wildlife
   Refuge. The development of a tailored monitoring program as a component
   of adaptive management could help reduce uncertainty about controlled
   and uncontrolled variation in transition probabilities of scrub-height
   and thus lead to improved decision making.}},

Abstract = {{In the face of ongoing atmospheric nutrient loads the employment of
   management measures to remove nutrients from heathland ecosystems has
   increased in importance. The present study is the first to analyse
   whether Calluna vulgaris is a suitable bio-monitor of
   management-mediated nutrient pools in heathland ecosystems. If Calluna
   vulgaris proves to be an appropriate indicator, its bio-indicative usage
   may prove to be a helpful tool for an assessment of management success
   in heathland ecosystems. In the Luneburger Heide nature reserve (NW
   Germany) we analysed the impacts of grazing, mowing, prescribed burning,
   choppering and sod-cutting on the nutritional status of Calluna vulgaris
   by measuring nutrient contents (N, P, Ca, Mg, K) of current year's
   shoots I and 5 years after application of management measures. Results
   were related to management-induced nutrient flows and nutrient pools at
   the focal heath sites. Our results indicate that the less the physical
   environment of a heath site was affected by management measures the
   better the nutrient contents of current year's shoots of Calluna
   vulgaris mirrored changes in nutrient pools. For low-intensity measures
   (i.e. grazing, mowing, prescribed burning), shoot nutrient contents were
   a suitable indicator for changes in nutrient pools, particularly for
   nutrients with conservative cycles such as P. At grazed and mown sites
   high output rates of P caused by these measures were well reflected by
   decreased shoot P content. At burned sites, Calluna vulgaris proved to
   be a good indicator of changes in nutrient pools of the organic layer,
   mainly attributable to the deposition of nutrients with ash. In
   contrast, at sites subjected to high-intensity measures, shoot nutrient
   contents did not reflect management-mediated shifts in nutrient pools,
   despite the high nutrient losses caused by choppering and sod-cutting.
   At these sites, shoot nutrient contents mirrored only the effects of
   altered mineralisation rates attributable to changes in the physical
   environment following high-intensity measures. As plant growth and
   competition in heathlands is considered to be controlled by N or P,
   shoot N:P ratios are recommended as a tool to indicate whether plant
   growth tends to be limited by N, by P or by N and P. This, in turn,
   allows for an assessment of long-term effects of both atmospheric
   nutrient loads and management-mediated shifts in N and P pools at a
   focal heath site. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used radiotelemetry to locate 59 roosts of long-legged myotis (Myotis
   volans) and other bat species at Mt. Trumbull in northwestern Arizona
   from May - August, 1997 - 1999. Of the 59 roosts located, 55 were found
   in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags. At least 15 of the
   radio-telemetered bats used more than one roost. Length of stay at a
   roost ranged from one to five days ((x) over bar =1.99days). At least
   five of the tagged bats foraged more than 10 kin from their day roosts.
   Roost snags were taller, found on shallower slopes, and were located
   closer to drainages than randomly selected snags that were not active
   roosts. Over 80\% of the roost snags had loose, exfoliating bark The
   forest surrounding roost snags was more open than randomly selected
   snags and had higher densities of larger diameter class trees and snags.
   Roost snags were more common in areas with evidence of recent fire. We
   used these habitat characteristics to develop a logistic regression
   model that correctly classified 79.2\% of the roosts and 80.3\% of the
   random snags. Nine of 12 habitat variables in our model support the
   theory that bats gain energetic benefits from selecting roosts in
   structures that receive high levels of solar radiation. Our study
   suggests that forest management practices that promote retention of old
   growth in open stands should increase available roosting habitat. We
   recommend leaving large diameter trees in open park-like areas,
   retaining snags, restoring a quasi-natural regime of low intensity fires
   to mimic natural processes, and to maintain these conditions in the long
   term.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of acres of dry, frequent-fire woodlands and forests in western
   North America are the focus of multi-million dollar ecosystem
   restoration and fuel treatment activities. Societal awareness and
   engagement with these ecosystems has intensified due to recent mega
   fires and projections for increased vulnerability of these systems to
   fire, insects, and drought-related stressors. Also, the importance of
   goods and services provided by dry forests has expanded to include many
   values, such as watershed protection, habitat for biodiversity, and
   recreation as well as timber. Public awareness of fire and other risks
   associated with current conditions in dry forests generally is high and
   broad support exists for active management over passive alternatives.
   Efforts to integrate scientific principles with societal goals in dry
   forest restoration programs are encouraging but significant social
   barriers remain related to funding, conflicting goals (e.g., smoke vs.
   human health and restoration vs. preservation of species habitat), and
   stakeholder trust. The limited area restored relative to the extensive
   vulnerable area suggests that the seriousness and complexity of the
   threats are not fully appreciated or not given sufficient priority for
   funding, despite stated preferences for restorative management. Hence,
   challenges remain. Societal choices ultimately determine the goals,
   extent, and methodology of dry forest restoration programs with science
   stimulating and informing policy and management decisions.}},

Title = {{Risks in extrapolating habitat preferences over the geographical range
   of threatened taxa: a case study of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) in
   the southern forests of Western Australia}},

Abstract = {{Context. Extrapolation of knowledge for threatened taxa between parts of
   their range that are disconnected and/or ecologically diverse can result
   in significant sources of error that undermine the effectiveness of
   conservation efforts.
   Aims. We investigated the risks associated with extrapolation of
   ecological information across environmental gradients, using the quokka
   (Setonix brachyurus) as a case study. Information documented in the
   northern part of its range is currently used to manage this species
   across its range in south-western Australia. We examined the suitability
   of this approach by developing a habitat suitability model (HSM) for the
   quokka in the southernmost areas of its range and comparing this with
   existing knowledge for the species.
   Methods. We surveyed 327 sites, representative of a range of ecotypes,
   for presence/absence of quokkas. Occupancy models were applied to select
   a subset of habitat variables that best predicted occupancy patterns.
   Key results. Occupancy patterns were influenced by complex vegetation
   structure, low levels of woody debris and habitat patchiness. HSMs
   developed for quokkas in the north could not predict occupancy patterns
   in the south. Significant fragmentation of subpopulations was observed
   due to patchiness in the availability of suitable habitat.
   Conclusions. The choice of predictor variables in HSMs that are not
   transferrable between regions could contribute to inappropriate
   management of habitat for quokkas and an increased risk of local
   extinctions. In addition, failure to consider processes that affect
   preferred habitat variables could contribute to the segregation of
   habitat patches and intervening distances that are too great for
   successful dispersal, immigration and recolonisation processes.
   Implications. The extrapolation of HSMs between geographical areas can
   increase the risk of outcomes that are detrimental to the conservation
   of threatened species. Where such extrapolation is necessary, actions
   guided by the HSMs should be implemented in a management framework that
   can detect adverse effects, allow for inclusion of new ecological
   information and explicitly consider the limitations and assumptions of
   this approach. In addition, perceptions of habitat fragmentation need to
   include processes such as fire regimes and feral animals that affect the
   availability and connectivity of habitat and have the potential to
   adversely affect population viability.}},
