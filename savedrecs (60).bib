Abstract = {{The effects of large ungulate herbivory on plant community structure and
   composition can vary considerably in regions susceptible to frequent
   wildfires. The Cerro Grande Fire (CGF) of May 2000 burned 17,400 ha of
   elk transitory-use range in the Jemez Mountains, north-central New
   Mexico. Our objective was to determine if habitat use changed temporally
   following the fire and if graminoid cover offset use of regenerating
   woody species. We assessed female elk habitat use at the landscape, home
   range, and burned area scales using distance analyses techniques, diet
   analyses, and browsing data. Across the landscape, elk selected home
   ranges with a grassland component. Selection of home ranges across the
   landscape was not influenced by the burned area within 4 years
   post-fire. Within home ranges, preference for burned area was similar to
   other habitats suggesting the burned area played a more important role
   at the home range scale compared to the landscape scale, particularly
   during drought. The presence of graminoids in elk pellets collected from
   the burned area increased while shrubs decreased over time. The decrease
   in shrubs may have been due to an increase in graminoid production after
   the fire. Applying burn treatments to transitory ranges in the Jemez
   Mountains at a rate that will maintain growth of early to mid-seral
   stage vegetation may help off-set use of sensitive woody plant
   communities via the production of graminoids. Re-seeding grasses
   immediately following fire may help to reduce herbivore use of woody
   plants such as aspen during the earlier stages of re-growth.}},

Abstract = {{Many low-elevation dry forests of the western United States contain more
   small trees and fewer large trees, more down woody debris, and less
   diverse and vigorous understory plant communities compared to conditions
   under historical. re regimes. These altered structural conditions may
   contribute to increased probability of unnaturally severe wild. res,
   susceptibility to uncharacteristic insect outbreaks, and drought-related
   mortality. Broad-scale fuel reduction and restoration treatments are
   proposed to promote stand development on trajectories toward more
   sustainable structures. Little research to date, however, has quantified
   the effects of these treatments on the ecosystem, especially delayed and
   latent tree mortality resulting directly or indirectly from treatments.
   In this paper, we explore complex hypotheses relating to the cascade of
   effects that influence ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mortality using structural equation modeling
   (SEM). We used annual census and plot data through six growing seasons
   after thinning and four growing seasons after burning from a replicated,
   operational-scale, completely randomized experiment conducted in
   northeastern Oregon, USA, as part of the national Fire and Fire
   Surrogate study. Treatments included thin, burn, thin followed by burn
   (thin + burn), and control. Burn and thin + burn treatments increased
   the proportion of dead trees while the proportion of dead trees declined
   or remained constant in thin and control units, although the density of
   dead trees was essentially unchanged with treatment. Most of the new
   mortality (96\%) occurred within two years of treatment and was
   attributed to bark beetles. Bark beetle-caused tree mortality, while low
   overall, was greatest in thin + burn treatments. SEM results indicate
   that the probability of mortality of large-diameter ponderosa pine from
   bark beetles and wood borers was directly related to surface. re
   severity and bole charring, which in turn depended on. re intensity,
   which was greater in units where thinning increased large woody fuels.
   These results have implications when deciding among management options
   for restoring ecosystem health in similar ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent
   species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle
   (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount
   of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed
   Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the
   Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource
   selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by
   summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black
   Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection
   by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We
   estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28
   in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall
   prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource
   selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian
   framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in
   habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by
   MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer
   wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall
   prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size
   was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and
   was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home
   range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size =
   460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a
   tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal
   area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative
   value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more
   important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of
   1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by
   exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This
   recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in
   summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50\% of summer wildfires
   >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recently burned coniferous forests host wildlife communities that
   respond to variation in burn severity, post-fire habitat structure, and
   patch configuration. Habitat selection theory predicts that birds
   inhabiting these variable post-fire landscapes will select nesting
   locations that confer an adaptive advantage through increased fitness
   and reproductive success. Understanding the effect of post-fire habitat
   on avian nesting ecology can provide valuable information to guide
   restoration and management after wildfire. The Black-backed Woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forests
   in the western United States, where it is used as an indicator species
   for the effects of post-fire forest management. Between 2011 and 2018,
   we located and monitored 118 Black-backed Woodpecker nests in burned
   forests of northern California. We evaluated the influence of habitat
   and nest characteristics on nest site selection and daily nest survival.
   Our results demonstrate a pattern of neutral congruence between habitat
   selection and fitness. Black-backed Woodpeckers showed strong selection
   for each of the nest habitat variables that we measured: woodpeckers
   selected moderately sized trees in areas of high snag density burned at
   high severity, but also in areas relatively close to low-severity or
   unburned edges. However, only nest initiation date affected nest
   survival, with decreased survival in late-season nests. Our results
   suggest that management actions aimed at maintaining breeding habitat
   for Black-backed Woodpeckers should prioritize retention and creation of
   pyrodiverse landscapes that include dense stands of snags (> 5 snags per
   100 m(2)) within similar to 500 m of forest that burned at low severity

Abstract = {{The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated
   species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically
   within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage
   logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a
   negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One
   strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on
   Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense
   snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely
   untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag
   islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve
   habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species.
   In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were
   effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following
   logging operations that covered 45\% of the burned area. We
   systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed
   Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and
   compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to
   other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined
   significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed
   Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral
   unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat
   for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this
   study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the
   first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year,
   which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed
   Woodpeckers postlogging.}},

Abstract = {{The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is considered a fire
   specialist throughout its breeding range. Given its high abundance in
   recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source
   habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to
   evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed
   woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central
   Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally
   and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential
   source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time.
   Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined
   significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success
   declined from 84\% the first year after fire to 73\% and 25\%,
   respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density
   and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of
   burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests.
   Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests.
   Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates
   indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats
   for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a
   function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire
   forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone
   ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature

Abstract = {{We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers

   and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds
   positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from
   logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult
   males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form
   in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed
   Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial
   scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree
   (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level,
   0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch
   characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's
   information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree-
   and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to
   characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between
   foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that
   foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees
   and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly
   because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on
   recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that
   retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to
   provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry
   coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire,
   conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the
   suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8

Abstract = {{Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal
   of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this
   practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become
   accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood
   (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and
   adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus
   banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn
   severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect
   counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire
   amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low=7-15\% and high=25-35\% of the
   unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control=no salvaging to
   high=60-70\% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity
   (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are
   presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total
   woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably
   black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to
   increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes
   auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in
   the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed
   woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and
   second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in
   mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to
   increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat
   was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent
   winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood
   areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn
   severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with
   chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among
   coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees
   had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce
   (ca. 65-75\% versus 15\% of trees). These results indicate the crucial
   influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests
   and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention
   of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support
   these dead-wood dependent birds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring
   disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers

   recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing
   the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss

   created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle
   infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We
   studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and
   reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black
   Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile
   survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and
   habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival
   models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated
   demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile
   survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer
   wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat
   created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of
   population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created
   by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and

   rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire
   underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the

Abstract = {{Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2
   broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy
   woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for
   differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and
   hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the
   importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the
   black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic
   population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and
   black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek
   fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased
   markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained
   high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2
   years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ ha.
   Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately
   to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval
   wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on
   less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark
   beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to
   earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in
   foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology
   of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly
   females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy
   woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than
   males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from
   foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following
   initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts,
   woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our
   results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in
   its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying
   conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may
   be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire
   suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are
   pursued following fires.}},

Title = {{Toward meaningful snag-management guidelines for postfire salvage

Abstract = {{The bird species in western North America that are most restricted to,
   and therefore most dependent on, severely burned conifer forests during
   the first years following afire event depend heavily on the abundant
   standing snags for perch sites, nest sites, and food resources. Thus, it
   is critical to develop and apply appropriate snag-management guidelines
   to implement postfire timber harvest operations in the same locations.
   Unfortunately, existing guidelines designed for green-tree forests
   cannot be applied to postfire salvage sales because the snag needs of
   snag-dependent species in burned forests are not at all similar to the
   snag needs of snag-dependent species in green-tree forests. Birds in
   burned forests have very different snag-retention needs from those
   cavity nesting bird species that have served as the focus for the
   development of existing snag-management guidelines. Specifically, many
   postfire specialists use standing dead trees not only for nesting
   purposes but for feeding purposes as well. Woodpeckers, in particular,
   specialize on wood-boring beetle larvae that are superabundant in
   fire-killed trees for several years following severe fire. Species such
   as the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) are nearly restricted
   in their habitat distribution to severely burned forests. Moreover,
   existing postfire salvage-logging studies reveal that most postfire
   specialist species are completely absent from burned forests that have
   been (even partially) salvage logged. I call for the long-overdue
   development and use of more meaningful snag-retention guidelines for
   postfire specialists, and I note that the biology of the most
   fire-dependent bird species suggests that even a cursory attempt to meet
   their snag needs would preclude postfire salvage logging in those
   severely burned conifer forests wherein the maintenance of biological
   diversity is deemed important.}},

Abstract = {{Large wildfire events in coniferous forests of the western United States
   are often followed by postfire timber harvest. The long-term impacts of
   postfire timber harvest on fire-associated cavity-nesting bird species
   are not well documented. We studied nest-site selection by
   cavity-nesting birds over a 10-year period (1994-2003), representing
   1-11 years after fire, on two burns created by mixed severity wildfires
   in western Idaho, USA. One burn was partially salvaged logged (the
   Foothills burn), the other was primarily unlogged (the Star Gulch burn).
   We monitored 1367 nests of six species (Lewis's Woodpecker Melanerpes
   lewis, Hairy Woodpecker Picoides villosus, Black-backed Woodpecker P.
   arcticus, Northern Flicker Colaptes auratus, Western Bluebird Sialia
   mexicana, and Mountain Bluebird S. currucoides). Habitat data at nest
   and non-nest random locations were characterized at fine (field
   collected) and coarse (remotely sensed) spatial scales. Nest-site
   selection for most species was consistently associated with higher snag
   densities and larger snag diameters, whereas wildfire location
   (Foothills versus Star Gulch) was secondarily important. All woodpecker
   species used nest sites with larger diameter snags that were surrounded
   by higher densities of snags than at non-nest locations. Nests of Hairy
   Woodpecker and Mountain Bluebird were primarily associated with the
   unlogged wildfire, whereas nests of Lewis's Woodpecker and Western
   Bluebird were associated with the partially logged burn in the early
   years after fire. Nests of wood-probing species (Hairy and Black-backed
   Woodpeckers) were also located in larger forest patch areas than patches
   measured at non-nest locations. Our results confirm previous findings
   that maintaining clumps of large snags in postfire landscapes is
   necessary for maintaining breeding habitat of cavity-nesting birds.
   Additionally, appropriately managed salvage logging can create habitat

Abstract = {{Salvage logging practices in recently burned forests often have direct
   effects on species associated with dead trees, particularly

   practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for

   of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire,
   calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest
   height, and tree harvest {[}partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged]).
   Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of

Abstract = {{Woodpeckers are often focal species for informing management of recently
   burned forests. Snags generated by wildfire provide key nesting and
   foraging resources for woodpeckers, and nest cavities excavated by
   woodpeckers are subsequently used by many other species. Habitat
   suitability models applicable in newly burned forest are important
   management tools for identifying areas likely to be used by nesting
   woodpeckers. Here we present and test predictive models for mapping
   woodpecker nest-site habitat across wildfire locations that can be used
   to inform post-fire planning and salvage logging decisions. From 2009 to
   2016, we monitored 313 nest sites of 4 species-Black-backed Woodpecker
   (Picoides arcticus), Hairy Woodpecker (Dryobates villosus), White-headed
   Woodpecker (D. albolarvatus), and Northern Flicker (Colaptes
   auratus)-from 3 wildfires in the Northern Sierra Nevada and Southern
   Cascades 1-5 yr after fire. Using these data, we developed habitat
   suitability index models that compared nest vs. non-nest sites for each
   species using (1) exclusively remotely sensed covariates, and (2)
   combinations of remotely sensed and field-collected covariates. We
   emphasized predictive performance across wildfire locations when
   selecting models to retain generalizable habitat relationships useful
   for informing management in newly burned locations. We identified models
   for all 4 species with strong predictive performance across wildfire
   locations despite notable variation in conditions among locations,
   suggesting broad applicability to guide post-fire management in the
   Sierra Nevada region. Top models for nest-site selection underscored the
   importance of high burn severity at the local scale, lower burn severity
   at the 1-km scale, mid-sized nest-tree diameters, and nest trees with
   broken tops. Models restricted to remotely sensed covariates exhibited
   similar predictive performance as combination models and are valuable
   for mapping habitat across entire wildfire locations to help delineate
   project areas or habitat reserves. Combination models are especially
   relevant for design of silvicultural prescriptions.}},

Abstract = {{Models of habitat suitability in postfire landscapes are needed by land
   managers to make timely decisions regarding postfire timber harvest and
   other management activities. Many species of cavity-nesting birds are
   dependent on postfire landscapes for breeding and other aspects of their
   life history and are responsive to postfire management activities (e.g.,
   timber harvest). In addition, several cavity nesters are designated as
   species at risk. We compare the ability of 2 types of models to
   distinguish between nest and non-nest locations of 6 cavity-nesting bird
   species (Lewis's woodpecker {[}Melanerpes lewis], black-backed
   woodpecker {[}Picoides arcticus], hairy woodpecker {[}P. villosus],
   northern flicker {[}Colaptes auratus], western bluebird {[}Sialia
   mexicana], and mountain bluebird {[}S. currucoides]) in the early
   postfire years for a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in Idaho,
   USA. The 2 model sets consisted of 1) models based on readily available
   remotely sensed data and 2) models containing field-collected data in
   addition to remotely sensed data (combination models). We evaluated
   models of nesting habitat by quantifying the model's ability to
   correctly identify nest and non-nest locations and by determining the
   percentage of correctly identified nest locations. Additionally, we
   developed relative habitat-suitability maps for nesting habitat of
   black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers from the best models. For all
   species except Lewis's woodpeckers, model performance improved with the
   addition of field-collected data. Models containing remotely sensed data
   adequately distinguished between nest and non-nest locations for
   black-backed woodpecker and Lewis's woodpecker only, whereas models
   containing both field-collected and remotely sensed data were adequate
   for all 6 species. Improvements in the availability of more accurate
   remote sensing technology would likely lead to improvements in the
   ability of the models to predict nesting locations. External validation
   with data from other wildfires is necessary to confirm the general
   applicability of our habitat-suitability models to other forests. Land
   managers responsible for maintaining habitat for cavity-nesting birds in
   postfire landscapes can use these models to identify potential nesting
   areas for these species and select areas in burned forests where
   postfire salvage logging is most likely to have minimal impacts on

Abstract = {{1. It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are
   likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are
   supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy
   and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.
   2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of
   landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given
   occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape
   with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then
   subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts
   for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across
   heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at
   fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single
   home range or territory.
   3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests.
   Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density
   given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory
   size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and
   home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers
   at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with
   independently collected survey data, showing that the model is
   successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as
   relative abundance within and among fires.
   4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for
   fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet
   elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for
   many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological
   exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range
   size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the
   Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers
   to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing
   for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation
   efforts that require snag removal.}},

Abstract = {{To conserve habitat for disturbance specialist species, ecologists must
   identify where individuals will likely settle in newly disturbed areas.
   Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances
   will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly
   disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive
   accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat
   suitability for nesting Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a
   burned-forest specialist) at 20 recently (6years postwildfire) burned
   locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three
   locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using
   three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis
   D-2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables
   describing burn severity, the north-south orientation of topographic
   slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions
   into binary classifications (0=low suitability to unsuitable, 1=high to
   moderate suitability), we compiled ensemble predictions, consisting of
   the number of models (0-8) predicting any given site as highly suitable.
   The suitability status for 40\% of the area burned by eastside Montana
   wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to
   uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in
   alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions
   exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with
   apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2)
   declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with
   our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., no-analogue) environments. Areas
   of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help
   validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black-backed
   Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented
   here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with
   habitat conservation in burned-forest landscapes where black-backed
   woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available. Ensemble
   modeling represents a promising tool for guiding conservation of
   large-scale disturbance specialists.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public
   lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the
   impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies
   with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive,
   threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy
   modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of
   management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a
   Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for
   detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for
   identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities.
   Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the
   effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the
   intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection
   probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of
   the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite
   estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed
   species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our
   modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a
   ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire
   treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several
   bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species
   of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial
   insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus
   migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas
   three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker
   (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined
   following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining
   the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use
   these methods to provide guidance for future management activities.}},

   Control-treatment comparisons for a herbicide application or a broadcast
   burning treatment were conducted at the coastal study area from 1982 to
   1984. Replicate control-treatment comparisons between these two
   silvicultural practices were conducted at the interior study area within
   the period 1989 to 1992. Small-mammal populations were intensively
   livetrapped in all control and treatment blocks. Deer mouse (Peromyscus
   maniculatus Wagner) populations showed short-term (1-2 months) declines
   after treatments at the coastal study area but appeared little affected
   by these habitat alterations at the interior area. Voles of the genus
   Microtus disappeared from burned blocks at the interior area but
   Microtus oregoni (Merriam) persisted on the burned block at the coastal
   area; however, the red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi Vigors) did

Abstract = {{Wildfires have major impacts on ecosystems globally. Fire regimes
   (including fire frequency, intensity, season and type of fire) influence
   the status of species by altering habitat suitability at the site scale,
   and by creating heterogeneity at the landscape scale. The relative
   effects of site and landscape-scale fire attributes on animal species
   are rarely examined together. Such knowledge is important, given that
   fire regimes are sensitive to changing land management practices; and
   that fires are predicted to become larger and more frequent in some
   regions as a result of climate change. Here, we tested the relative
   influence of elements of the fire regime (fire severity, fire history)
   at the site-scale, and the landscape context (extent of
   surrounding{''}unburnt forest, fire heterogeneity) on the occurrence of
   native terrestrial mammals after severe wildfire in south-eastern
   Australia. We conducted surveys by using automatically triggered,
   infrared cameras at 80 sites in fire-prone eucalypt forests, 2-3 years
   post-wildfire. Thirteen native mammal species were recorded, eight of
   which were detected with sufficient frequency for analysis. Most species
   were widespread (35-90\% of sites) and recorded in all fire severity
   classes. Fire effects at the site level were more influential than
   landscape context effects arising from heterogeneity in the fire regime
   (e.g. extent of surrounding unburnt forest). Fire severity was the most
   influential of the fire-regime elements investigated, but it affected
   different species in different ways. This study highlights three main
   points relevant to conservation of terrestrial mammals after wildfire.
   First, spatial variation in fire severity associated with wildfire
   (ranging from unburned to severely burned stands) is an important
   contributor to the post-fire status of species. Second, post-fire
   environmental conditions are significant: here, rapid regeneration of
   vegetation following drought-breaking rains greatly influenced the
   suitability of post-fire habitats. Third, it is valuable to consider the
   effects of the fire regime at multiple scales, including both the site
   (forest stand) and its landscape context. Insights from short-term
   surveys, such as this, will be enhanced by complementary longitudinal
   studies, especially where they encompass environmental variation through
   the post-fire succession. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the intensification of human activities, preserving animal
   populations is a contemporary challenge of critical importance. In this
   context, the umbrella species concept is appealing because preserving a
   single species should result in the protection of multiple co-occurring
   species. Practitioners, though, face the task of having to find suitable
   umbrellas to develop single-species management guidelines. In North
   America, boreal forests must be managed to facilitate the recovery of
   the threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Yet, the effect of
   caribou conservation on co-occurring animal species remains poorly
   documented. We tested if boreal caribou can constitute an effective
   umbrella for boreal fauna. Birds, small mammals, and insects were
   sampled along gradients of post-harvest and post-fire forest succession.
   Predictive models of occupancy were developed from the responses of 95
   species to characteristics of forest stands and their surroundings. We
   then assessed the similarity of species occupancy expected between
   simulated harvested landscapes and a 90 000-km(2) uncut landscape.
   Managed landscapes were simulated based on three levels of disturbance,
   two timber-harvest rotation cycles, and dispersed or aggregated
   cut-blocks. We found that management guidelines that were more likely to
   maintain caribou populations should also better preserve animal
   assemblages. Relative to fragmentation or harvest cycle, we detected a
   stronger effect of habitat loss on species assemblages. Disturbing 22\%,
   35\%, and 45\% of the landscape should result, respectively, in 80\%,
   60\%, and 40\% probability for caribou populations to be sustainable; in
   turn, this should result in regional species assemblages with Jaccard
   similarity indices of 0.86, 0.79, and 0.74, respectively, relative to
   the uncut landscape. Our study thus demonstrates the value of
   single-species management for animal conservation. Our quantitative
   approach allows for the evaluation of management guidelines prior to
   implementation, thereby providing a tool for establishing suitable
   compromises between economic and environmental sustainability of human
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{Existing fire policy encourages the maintenance of ecosystem integrity
   in fire management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed
   for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We
   discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra
   Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other
   fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing
   for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem
   integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter
   (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level)
   approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology
   objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter
   level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity.
   Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can
   be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires,
   which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic
   otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers
   can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on
   the degree to which those species depend on fire and accommodate their
   specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides
   arcticus {[}Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring
   the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity
   fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis
   {[}Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that
   uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to
   logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland
   fire for ecosystem integrity and species viability with strategic
   deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of
   pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management
   goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity.}},

   different forest habitat conditions in Sierra Nevada conifer forests:

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Expanding the footprint of natural fire has been proposed as one
   potential solution to increase the pace of forest restoration programs
   in fire-adapted landscapes of the western USA. However, studies that
   examine the long-term socio-ecological trade-offs of expanding natural
   fire to reduce wildfire risk and create fire resilient landscapes are
   lacking. We used the model Envision to examine the outcomes that might
   result from increased area burned by what we call ``restoration{''}
   wildfire in a landscape where the ecological benefits of wildfire are
   known, but the need to suppress high-risk fires that threaten human
   values is also evident. Our study area, in the eastern Cascades of
   Oregon, USA, includes the Deschutes National Forest where large tracts
   of mixed conifer forest structure are outside the historical range of
   variation and characterized by multi-layer, closed-canopy stands. We
   found that simulation of one restoration wildfire per year in addition
   to high-risk wildfires in the regular fire season and over the course of
   50 yr resulted in a 23\% increase in total area burned, but the same
   probability of fire-on-fire interactions. This translated into 0.3\% of
   the national forest burned by restoration wildfire per year and had a
   small impact in area burned by high-risk fires albeit more likely in
   extreme fire years. Smoke production doubled in the restoration scenario
   relative to the scenario without restoration wildfire, but still
   resulted in minimal smoke production in most years. Restoration fires
   burned with low- to mixed-severity and led to a steady reduction in
   canopy cover and increase in resilient forest structure in dry-forest
   types. Habitat for the federally protected northern spotted owl declined
   with the inclusion of restoration fire, while habitat for species that
   use recently burned forest stands (e.g., black-backed woodpecker)
   increased. Our results suggest that restoration wildfire can improve
   forest resilience and contribute to restoration efforts in fire-adapted
   forests, but there are trade-offs (wildlife habitat, smoke, area burned
   in fire-sensitive forest types), and the level of restoration fire use
   we simulated is unlikely to have a significant impact on the occurrence
   of high-severity wildfires.}},

Abstract = {{Following wildfire, forest managers are challenged with meeting both
   socioeconomic demands (e.g., salvage logging) and mandates requiring
   habitat conservation for disturbance-associated wildlife (e.g.,
   woodpeckers). Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be
   informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand
   how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform
   post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat
   suitability models and tested their transferability for 2
   disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides
   arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability
   models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing
   environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed
   models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho,
   and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate
   ({''}application{''}) locations. Models generally discriminated nest
   from non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but
   performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited
   transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that
   included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater
   transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only
   included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally
   poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model
   transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any
   one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the
   entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally
   applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore
   likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations.}},

Abstract = {{In spring 1994, the Intermountain Research Station (now Rocky Mountain
   Research Station), Boise National Forest, and Region 4 of the Forest
   Service initiated long-term studies on bird responses to different fire
   conditions in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests of southwestern Idaho.
   The first phase of the project is to evaluate effects of high-intensity
   wildfire on cavity-nesting bi rds and their associated habitats. During
   spring/summer 1994-1996 we monitored 695 nests of nine cavity-nesting
   bird species (including three Forest Service Sensitive Species:
   Black-backed, White-headed, and Lewis' woodpeckers) and measured
   vegetation at nest sites and at 90 randomly located sites. The burned
   forests used for study areas were created in 1992 and 1994 by primarily
   high-intensity wildfire, thus most standing trees were snags. Nests and
   vegetation were monitored in three treatments: standard-cut salvage
   logged, wildlife-prescription salvage logged, and unlogged controls.
   Tree densities for small diameter trees (>23 cm to less than or equal to
   53 cm {[}>9{''} to less than or equal to 20{''}] diameter breast height
   {[}dbh]) in the unlogged units averaged 81 snags per ha (33 per acre)
   and for larger trees (>53 cm dbh {[}>20{''}]) averaged 17 snags per ha
   (7 per acre). In salvage-logged units about 50\% of the trees were
   harvested, tree densities for small trees averaged 43 snags per ha (17
   per acre) and for large trees ave raged 5 snags per ha (2 per acre).
   Lewis' Woodpecker was the most abundant (208 nests) and successful
   cavity nester on the 2-4 year-old burns, while Black-backed and
   White-headed woodpeckers were rare (23 nests). Lewis' Woodpecker and
   American Kestrel experienced the highest nesting success in the
   salvage-logged units, whereas Northern Flicker and Hairy Woodpecker were
   most successful in the unlogged units. All bird species selected nest
   sites with higher tree densities than that measured at random sites, and
   cavity nesters as a group selected clumps of snags rather than snags
   that were retained in uniform, evenly-spaced distributions. Among bird
   species, Black-backed Woodpeckers used nest sites with the highest tree
   densities, while Lewis' Woodpeckers selected relatively open nest sites.
   Cavity-nesters as a group selected larger diameter and more heavily
   decayed snags than that expected based on availability of such snags.
   Snags with the highest probability (>85\%) of being classified as nest
   trees were characterized by heavy decay and broken tops that pre-dated
   the wildfire. We discuss management implications of stand-replacement
   fire and post-fire salvage logging for cavity-nesting birds. Future
   plans are outlined, including bird and plant responses to different fire
   conditions (stand-replacement fire, fire suppression, and prescribed
   fire). The intent of this work is to provide information on the action
   and no action alternatives to the Forest Health Initiative.}},

   small mammal removal (trapping) sampling (1-12 years post-burn). Small
   mammal species richness and diversity were generally higher on unburned
   than burned plots across post-burn sampling years and sites. Increased
   abundance of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) following burning
   resulted in decreased community diversity. Species similarities between
   burned and unburned plots were low in early post-burn years but
   increased in later post-burn years. Short-term shifts in diversity and

   burning. However, burning had no long-term impact on species richness

Abstract = {{Fire has shaped much of the Australian landscape, and alterations to
   natural or historical fire regimes are implicated in the decline of many
   native mammal species. Time since fire (TSF) is a common metric used to
   understand vegetation and faunal responses to fire but is unlikely to
   capture the complexity of successional changes following fire. The New
   Holland mouse (Pseudomys novaehollandiae), a threatened and declining
   rodent species native to southeastern Australia, is traditionally
   considered an early post-fire successional species. Here, we use a
   48-year dataset to test whether this posited association with early TSF
   is upheld, and whether the species' occurrence and abundance are
   governed by TSF. We find support for a minimal influence of TSF on the
   species' occurrence, and that while abundance of P. novaehollandiae is
   partly explained by TSF, considerable uncertainty and variation among
   fire events and locations limit the usefulness of TSF in informing
   conservation management strategies. We suggest that it is not helpful to
   consider the species as early successional and that fire planning for P.
   novaehollandiae conservation is best considered at a local scale.
   Additionally, we provide guidelines for maximizing individual survival
   and persistence during and after planned burns.}},

Title = {{Aligning endangered species management with fire-dependent ecosystem
   restoration: manager perspectives on red-cockaded woodpecker and
   longleaf pine management actions}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: Endangered species management has been criticized as
   emphasizing a single-species approach to conservation and, in some
   cases, diverting resources from broad-based, land management objectives
   important for overall biodiversity maintenance. Herein we examine
   perceptions on management for an endangered species whose habitat
   requirements largely depend on frequent fire, the red-cockaded
   woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis Vieillot). In doing so, we consider
   the alignment between species-specific population recovery actions and
   broader ecosystem restoration goals. Through semi-structured interviews
   with natural resource professionals (n = 32) in the Southeast Coastal
   Plain of the United States, we examined manager perspectives on the
   evolution of recovery efforts and the potential alignment of recovery
   efforts with other management goals and objectives on public lands.
   Results: Participants described an evolution of approaches to manage
   red-cockaded woodpeckers, from an initial emphasis on intensive
   management actions with a single-species focus to reduce extinction risk
   (e.g., artificial inserts and translocation of individual birds) to a
   broader focus on restoring forest conditions and the processes that
   maintain them (e.g., fire). Most participants considered red-cockaded
   woodpecker habitat management to be compatible with other resource
   management actions (e.g., prescribed fire, mechanical thinning).
   However, there were some notable exceptions as a smaller but substantive
   number of participants indicated that specific habitat management
   guidelines (basal area guidelines for foraging habitat) posed a barrier
   to implementing preferred ecosystem restoration actions (transitioning
   stands of fast-growing, short-lived pines to longleaf pine {[}Pinus
   palustris Mill.]). Overall, participants expected efforts to provide
   habitat for red-cockaded woodpeckers to continue regardless of its
   conservation status and that intensive, single-species management
   actions would likely decrease over time.
   Conclusions: Providing for the specific needs of specialist species that
   are in decline is often necessary to prevent their extinction in the
   near term. Our findings suggest that the ability to connect long-term
   management actions to recover endangered species to other agency
   priorities may promote the willingness of managers to prioritize and
   continue long-term management of their habitats.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{437-445}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Unburnt patches within burnt landscapes are expected to provide an
   important resource for fauna, potentially acting as a refuge from direct
   effects of fire and allowing animals to persist in burnt landscapes.
   Nevertheless, there is little information about the way refugia are used
   by fauna and how populations may be affected by them. Planned burns are
   often patchy, with unburnt areas generally associated with gully systems
   providing a good opportunity to study faunal use of refugia. We used a
   before-after control-impact design associated with a planned burn in
   south eastern Australia to investigate how two small mammal species, the
   bush rat Rattus fuscipes and agile antechinus Antechinus agilis, used
   unburnt gully systems within a larger burnt area. We tested three
   alternative hypotheses relating to post-fire abundance: (i) active
   refugia - abundance would increase in unburnt patches because of a
   post-fire shift of individuals from burnt to unburnt areas; (ii) passive
   refugia - abundance in unburnt patches would remain similar to pre-fire
   levels; and (iii) limited or no refugia - abundance would reduce in
   unburnt patches related to the change induced by fire in the wider
   landscape. We found the two species responded differently to the
   presence of unburnt refugia in the landscape. Relative to controls, fire
   had little effect on bush rat abundance in gullies, supporting
   hypothesis 2. In contrast, agile antechinus abundance increased in
   gullies immediately post-fire consistent with a shift of individuals
   from burnt parts of the landscape, supporting hypothesis 1. Differences
   in site fidelity, habitat use and intraspecific competition between
   these species are suggested as likely factors influencing responses to
   refugia. The way unburnt patches function as faunal refugia and the
   subsequent influence they have on post-fire population dynamics, will to
   some extent depend on the life history attributes of individual species.}},

Abstract = {{In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important
   disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and
   faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including
   salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We
   compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in
   unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of
   salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags
   retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used
   analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses
   concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on
   densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two
   hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on
   relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the
   relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We
   did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or
   relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We
   detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns
   differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the
   black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P.
   villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee
   (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata)
   were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the
   unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco
   hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the
   moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment.
   We detected significant differences between years for four species of
   birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting
   species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond
   uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species
   that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage
   intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage
   logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important
   habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings
   parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting
   robust patterns that transcend particular locations. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Post-fire timber harvesting (salvage logging) is becoming more prevalent
   as logging companies try to recover some of the economic losses caused
   by fire. Because salvaging is a relatively new practice and because of
   the common perception that burned areas are of little value to wildlife,
   few guidelines exist for salvaging operations. We surveyed birds in
   unburned and burned stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.),
   mixedwood, and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) to
   characterize the post-fire bird community in commercially important
   forest types. The effects of salvage logging were examined in mixedwood
   and jack pine. Using fixed-radius point counts, a total of 1430
   individuals representing 51 species were detected during this study.
   Community analysis revealed that burned forests supported a distinct
   species assemblage of songbirds relative to unburned forests and that
   salvage logging significantly altered this community. An examination of
   guild composition showed that resident species. canopy and cavity
   nesters, and insectivores were the least likely to be detected in
   salvaged areas. Species less sensitive to salvage logging tended to be
   habitat generalists. omnivores, and specie, that nest on the ground or

Abstract = {{We examined short-term trends in relative abundance and species richness
   of breeding and wintering grassland birds before (1996) and after (1997,

   burn) 25-ha Plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent, control
   unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy
   ill areal extent, we observed that ground Cover was affected more
   strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite
   were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and
   mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was
   detected oil the burn unit following fire for either wintering or

   burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland
   species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite

Abstract = {{Aim
   Fire affects the structure and dynamics of ecosystems world-wide, over
   long time periods (decades and centuries) and at large spatial scales
   (landscapes and regions). A pressing challenge for ecologists is to
   develop models that explain and predict faunal responses to fire at
   broad temporal and spatial scales. We used a 105-year post-fire
   chronosequence to investigate small mammal responses to fire across an
   extensive area of `tree mallee' (i.e. vegetation characterized by small
   multi-stemmed eucalypts).
   Location
   The Murray Mallee region (104,000 km superset of) of semi-arid
   Australia.
   Methods
   First, we surveyed small mammals at 260 sites and explored the fire
   responses of four species using nonlinear regression models. Second, we
   assessed the predictive accuracy of models using cross-validation and by
   testing with independent data. Third, we examined our results in
   relation to an influential model of animal succession, the habitat
   accommodation model.
   Results
   Two of four study species showed a clear response to fire history. The
   distribution of the Mallee Ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, a carnivorous
   marsupial, was strongly associated with mature vegetation characterized
   by its cover of hummock grass. The occurrence of breeding females was
   predicted to increase up to 40-105 years post-fire, highlighting the
   extensive time periods over which small mammal populations may be
   affected by fire. Evaluation of models for N. yvonneae demonstrated that
   accurate predictions of species occurrence can be made from fire history
   and vegetation data, across large geographical areas. The introduced
   House Mouse Mus domesticus was the only species positively associated
   with recently burnt vegetation.
   Main conclusions
   Understanding the impact of fire over long time periods will benefit
   ecological and conservation management. In this example, tracts of
   long-unburnt mallee vegetation were identified as important habitat for
   a fire-sensitive native mammal. Small mammal responses to fire can be
   predicted accurately at broad spatial scales; however, a conceptual
   model of post-fire change in community structure developed in temperate
   Australia is not, on its own, sufficient for small mammals in semi-arid
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is widely used as a management tool to achieve conservation goals.
   However, the consequences of such management on non-target species are
   frequently neglected and unknown. This study examines the effects of
   traditional management practices of scrubland clearance by controlled
   burning to improve menaced carnivores on non-target species: rodent and
   insectivores in Donana National Park (SW of Iberian Peninsula). We used
   capture-recapture methods to examine changes in abundance in areas that
   were burnt one and three years ago, compared with unburnt areas. Results
   showed that burnt areas had higher species abundances, but mainly on the
   ecotonal boundaries. Species abundances showed dramatic seasonal
   differences with high abundances in autumn and winter, and very low
   abundance in summer. Our study revealed that scrubland management by
   controlled fires increases the abundance of small mammal species, mainly
   Mus spretus and Apodemus sylvaticus. We found only four small mammal
   species between the different treatments. However, some species that
   were formerly abundant in Donana, such as Elyomis quercinus, were found
   only in burnt areas. Our results suggest that controlled burning is not
   contributing to the current loss of biotic diversity in this community.

Abstract = {{Patch mosaic burning, in which fire is used to produce a mosaic of
   habitat patches representative of a range of fire histories
   ('pyrodiversity'), has been widely advocated to promote greater
   biodiversity. However, the details of desired fire mosaics for
   prescribed burning programs are often unspecified. Threatened small to
   medium-sized mammals (35 g to 5.5 kg) in the fire-prone tropical
   savannas of Australia appear to be particularly fire-sensitive.
   Consequently, a clear understanding of which properties of fire mosaics
   are most instrumental in influencing savanna mammal populations is
   critical. Here we use mammal capture data, remotely sensed fire
   information (i.e. time since last fire, fire frequency, frequency of
   late dry season fires, diversity of post-fire ages in 3 km radius, and
   spatial extent of recently burnt, intermediate and long unburnt habitat)
   and structural habitat attributes (including an index of cattle
   disturbance) to examine which characteristics of fire mosaics most
   influence mammals in the north-west Kimberley. We used general linear
   models to examine the relationship between fire mosaic and habitat
   attributes on total mammal abundance and richness, and the abundance of
   the most commonly detected species. Strong negative associations of
   mammal abundance and richness with frequency of late dry season fires,
   the spatial extent of recently burnt habitat (post-fire age <1 year
   within 3 km radius) and level of cattle disturbance were observed. Shrub
   cover was positively related to both mammal abundance and richness, and
   availability of rock crevices, ground vegetation cover and spatial
   extent of >= 4 years unburnt habitat were all positively associated with
   at least some of the mammal species modelled. We found little support
   for diversity of post-fire age classes in the models. Our results
   indicate that both a high frequency of intense late dry season fires and
   extensive, recently burnt vegetation are likely to be detrimental to
   mammals in the north Kimberley. A managed fire mosaic that reduces large
   scale and intense fires, including the retention of >= 4 years unburnt
   patches, will clearly benefit savanna mammals. We also highlighted the
   importance of fire mosaics that retain sufficient shelter for mammals.
   Along with fire, it is clear that grazing by introduced herbivores also
   needs to be reduced so that habitat quality is maintained.}},

   1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time
   since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and
   nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires,
   and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years
   after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest
   densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally
   increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed

   wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher
   in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly
   higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to
   favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities
   were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire
   period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little
   influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was
   significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged
   wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest
   survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus
   the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the
   salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over
   23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for
   open-space foragers during the decade following fire.}},

   longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased
   the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found
   in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots.
   Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the
   hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of
   importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed
   woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus
   bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the
   similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the
   similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were
   northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila
   aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species
   associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titruouse, northern cardinal,
   Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity ol'the reference
   condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas
   open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the
   fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and
   Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods.
   Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction
   plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the
   similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius
   paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were
   beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine
   sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and
   Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than
   red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these
   species depend directly on ground cover vegetation. We recommend
   prescribed spring burning as the most economical and ecologically
   desirable method for managing breeding bird habitat in longleaf pine
   sandhill forests.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire is a major driver of spatio-temporal variation in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Large wildfires are predicted to occur more frequently due
   to climate change. The mechanisms by which post-fire recovery proceeds
   are influenced by the abundance of survivors, and their distribution in
   relation to habitat variability and refugia. Thus, characterising early
   post-fire demographic processes is critical to understanding the
   demographic and community-level responses of ecosystems to fire. The
   Black Saturday fires of February 2009 burnt an area of approximately
   3500 km2 in Victoria, Australia. We quantified the effects of this high
   severity forest fire on the habitat, abundance, sex ratio and body mass
   of two small mammal species, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis and
   bush rat Rattus fuscipes. We developed a hypothetical framework to
   distinguish in situ survival and rapid recolonisation as the processes
   underlying short-term post-fire distributions. These hypotheses were
   based on expected patterns of abundance over increasing distances from
   unburnt sources, and the estimated recolonisation capabilities of each
   species and sex. The agile antechinus and bush rat were present in burnt
   sites at 30\% and 12\% of the density observed in unburnt sites. In situ
   survival, and not recolonisation, was the most plausible explanation for
   our findings. Abundance and body mass data indicated a greater effect of
   fire on the bush rat than the agile antechinus. The bush rat showed a
   shift in topographic association, whereby drainage lines acted as
   post-fire refugia. Our findings suggest these species do not depend on
   recolonisation for recovery, and that the bush rat will follow a
   nucleated recovery, expanding from topographic refugia. Thus,
   connectivity-reducing management activities, such as salvage logging and
   firebreak and road construction, may not affect the early stages of
   population recovery in remaining stands of burnt forest. Rather, ongoing
   recovery is likely to be limited by demographic rates and resource
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest
   practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more
   likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three
   replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following
   wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were
   chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having greater than
   or equal to 95\% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested
   sites retaining an average of 6\% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For
   all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird
   abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment
   types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five
   major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and
   harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified
   similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities
   occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of
   communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance.
   Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats
   were associated primarily with I-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed
   Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P.
   arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or
   nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in
   avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on
   postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were
   apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete
   convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry
   practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood
   forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper
   (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American
   Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on
   postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder
   Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina),
   Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Redstart (Setophaga
   rutticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted
   Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis),
   and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest
   stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger
   live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest
   designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention
   of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire
   salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of
   standing dead trees on the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, fire was one of the most widespread natural disturbances
   in the western United States. More recently, however, significant
   anthropogenic activities, especially fire suppression and silvicultural
   practices, have altered fire regimes; as a result, landscapes and
   associated communities have changed as well. Herein, we review current
   knowledge of how fire and post-fire salvaging practices affect avian
   communities in conifer-dominated forests of the western United States.
   Specifically, we contrast avian communities in (1) burned vs. unburned
   forest, and (2) unsalvaged vs. salvage-logged burns. We also examine how
   variation in burn characteristics (e.g., severity, age, size) and
   salvage logging can alter avian communities in burns.
   Of the 41 avian species observed in three or more studies comparing
   early post-fire and adjacent unburned forests, 22\% are consistently
   more abundant in burned forests, 34\% are usually more abundant in
   unburned forests, and 44\% are equally abundant in burned and unburned
   forests or have varied responses. In general, woodpeckers and aerial
   foragers are more abundant in burned forest, whereas most
   foliage-gleaning species are more abundant in unburned forests. Bird
   species that are frequently observed in stand-replacement burns are less
   common in understory burns; similarly, species commonly observed in
   unburned forests often decrease in abundance with increasing burn
   severity. Granivores and species common in open-canopy forests exhibit
   less consistency among studies. For all species, responses to fire may
   be influenced by a number of factors including burn severity, fire size
   and shape, proximity to unburned forests, pre- and post-fire cover
   types, and time since fire. In addition, post-fire management can alter
   species' responses to burns. Most cavity-nesting species do not use
   severely salvaged burns, whereas some cavity-nesters persist in
   partially salvaged burns. Early post-fire specialists, in particular,
   appear to prefer unsalvaged burns. We discuss several alternatives to
   severe salvage-logging that will help provide habitat for cavity
   nesters.
   We provide an overview of critical research questions and design
   considerations crucial for evaluating the effects of prescribed fire and
   other anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest fragmentation.
   Management of native avifaunas may be most successful if natural
   disturbance regimes, including fire, are permitted to occur when
   possible. Natural fires could be augmented with practices, such as
   prescribed fire (including high-severity fire), that mimic inherent
   disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire remains among the most controversial topics in nature
   conservation. Here, we address changes in abundance and species
   composition of the bee and wasp community following a temperate forest
   crown fire that led to nearly complete defoliation and dieback of trees
   within 2 years. We found a highly dynamic community of 252 bee and wasp
   species (representing 18.8 \% of total bee and wasp species known from
   the Czech Republic) that utilized 1-7-year-old burned forest stands.
   Species richness in the burned forest stands was significantly higher
   than that recorded in nearby forest that had been unaffected by any
   recent fire. The unburned forest hosted only 88 species. We found 42
   red-listed species, of which 40 were present in the burned forest, while
   only 12 were present in the control forest. Numerous early- and
   late-responding species were detected, but maximum species diversity was
   reached 3 years after the fire. Only 7 of the total of 261 species were
   limited to the forest that was unaffected by any recent fire. A
   management regime that supported the presence of bare sand and heather
   patches, and removal of all but solitary pine trees, was found to be
   insufficient to support the full spectrum of forest fire-dependent
   species. This was mainly due to the absence of charred or decaying dead
   wood, which is otherwise utilized by numerous red-listed cavity adopters
   that are absent in the surrounding cultural landscape. Retaining part of
   the charred trunks is suggested as a novel post-fire conservation

Abstract = {{Background Fires have a fundamental impact on phytocoenoses and,
   depending on the size of the fire, can have a positive or negative
   effect. The role of fires in the formation of the species composition of
   plants, restoration of stands and changes in soil properties is well
   studied. However, the long-term relationship between forest management
   methods, soil properties and epigeic entomofauna assemblages in
   post-fire areas is still not clear. The effects of Scots pine stand
   management methods on biochemical soil properties and ground beetle
   assemblages in the largest post-fire area in Central Europe after the
   second World were investigated. The study was conducted in the Rudy
   Raciborskie Forest district in southern Poland. The soil properties and
   epigeic beetle community structure were analysed. The research covered
   areas with natural and artificial pine regeneration, which were
   subjected to various care treatments. Results The tendency for higher
   accumulations of organic matter in the soil of stands that underwent
   natural regeneration was proven. The stimulating role of soil organic
   carbon on the activity of dehydrogenases in the soil of naturally
   renewed areas with silvicultural treatment (NRAT) was noted. Regardless
   of the manner of stand regeneration, the activity of beta-glucosidase
   was higher in the areas in which breeding treatments were practised.
   Furthermore, managed forest stands presented a higher abundance of
   carabid beetles than stands without treatment practices. Thirteen
   epigeic beetle species from the families Geotrupidae, Carabidae,
   Curculionidae, Cerambycidae and Silphidae were captured, with beetles
   from the first two families being the most numerous. Rare epigeal
   carabid species in the fauna of Poland and Europe, such as Carabus
   glabratus (Paykull) and Carabus auronitens Fabr., found appropriate
   habitat conditions for survival in the post-fire areas. Compared with
   the other areas, in the NRAT area, there were better stand and soil
   properties and more features conducive to epigeic entomofaunal
   occurrences. The highest post-fire content of polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons was recorded in the soils of the sites that underwent
   artificial regeneration. The results suggest that preparing the soil
   before the introduction of new vegetation affects the amount of aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs). Conclusions The better performance of the NRAT
   stand draws attention to the positive aspects of the use of natural
   regeneration, both from ecological and economic perspectives. The
   effects of forest management on the amount of soil organic matter after
   fires have been proven. The natural regeneration of stands was conducive
   to the accumulation of organic matter. The enzymatic activity of soils
   is influenced by the renewal method and forest management strategy. The
   NRAT area was characterized by the highest number of carabid species.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean countries have a long-standing afforestation tradition, at
   least since the 19th century, and especially the mid-20th century. Large
   forest fires started to occur in the late 1970s, and the routine
   post-fire restoration approach involved planting pines and building
   check dams according to the prevailing forest management practices at
   the time. Increasing short-interval recurrent wildfires have threatened
   the persistence of pine plantations. In the last two decades, post-fire
   restoration practices have increasingly diversified in both number of
   plant species used in plantations and type of restoration actions taken.
   In an attempt to provide a comprehensive post-fire restoration strategy,
   we are developing and testing a new protocol that includes scientific
   knowledge provided by fire and restoration ecology of recent decades.
   For regional planning, fire-vulnerable forests and shrublands are
   identified according to vegetation resilience and post-fire erosion risk
   using a GIS-based approach. Vegetation resilience is assessed on the
   basis of the fire regeneration strategies of dominant plant species. On
   a management scale, the need for short-term emergency actions is
   assessed according to field surveys of fire severity, vegetation
   resilience, and soil erosion risk. Vulnerable areas meriting emergency
   actions are those predicted to have a low plant cover regeneration rate
   and a high erosion risk. Mid-and long-term actions are planned according
   to the specific management objectives for burned areas, and to the
   prediction of long-term ecosystem recovery. These actions may include
   assisted natural regeneration, (re) introduction of tree or shrubby

Abstract = {{Fire is a natural, dynamic process that is integral to maintaining
   ecosystem function. The reintroduction of fire (e.g., prescribed fire,
   managed wildfire) is a critical management tool for protecting many
   frequent-fire forests against stand-replacing fires while restoring an
   essential ecological process. Understanding the effects of fire on
   forests and wildlife communities is important in natural resource
   planning efforts. Small mammals are key components of forest food webs
   and essential to ecosystem function. To investigate the relationship of
   fire to small mammal assemblages, we live trapped small mammals in 10
   burned and 10 unburned forests over 2 years in the central Sierra
   Nevada, California. Small mammal abundance was higher in unburned
   forests, largely reflecting the greater proportion of closed-canopy
   species such as Glaucomys sabrinus in unburned forests. The most
   abundant species across the entire study area was the highly adaptable
   generalist species, Peromyscus maniculatus. Species diversity was
   similar between burned and unburned forests, but burned forests were
   characterized by greater habitat heterogeneity and higher small mammal
   species evenness. The use and reintroduction of fire to maintain a
   matrix of burn severities, including large patches of unburned refugia,
   creates a heterogeneous and resilient landscape that allows for
   fire-sensitive species to proliferate and, as such, may help maintain
   key ecological functions and diverse small mammal assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effectiveness of forest fuel thinning projects that
   explicitly removed surface and ladder fuels (all but one were combined
   mechanical and prescribed fire/pile burn prescriptions) in reducing fire
   severity and tree mortality in 12 forest fires that burned in eastern
   and southern California between 2005 and 2011. All treatments and fires
   occurred in yellow pine or mixed conifer forests, in a variety of
   landscape conditions. Most fires burned under warm, dry conditions, with
   moderate to high winds. With few exceptions, fire severity measures
   (bole char height, scorch and torch height, scorch and torch percentage)
   and tree mortality were much lower in forest stands treated for fuels
   than in neighboring untreated stands. Fire-tolerant species like Pinus
   jeffreyi and Pinus ponderosa exhibited much higher postfire survivorship
   than fire-intolerant species like Abies concolor. Among variables
   related to fire weather, fuel loading, and treatment age, ten-hour fuel
   moisture was found to be a better predictor of tree survival in
   untreated stands than in treated stands, while fuel loading was a better
   predictor of survival in treated stands. We did not find an effect of
   treatment age, but our oldest treatments (nine years when burned) were
   below the mean pre-Euroamerican settlement fire return interval for
   these forest types. Within treatments, fire severity decreased with
   distance from the treatment boundary, and canopy fires were almost
   always reduced to surface fires within 70 m of entering the treatment.
   In California yellow pine and mixed conifer forests, treatment
   prescriptions should allow for levels of fire-driven canopy tree
   mortality (c. 5-15\%) that better mimic natural fires. Our results add
   significantly to the growing evidence that fuel treatments that include
   removal of surface and ladder fuels in these forest types are highly
   effective management tools for reducing fire severity and canopy tree
   mortality. In our opinion, quantitative assessments of fuel treatment
   effects on fire severity in frequent-fire forest types hardly merit
   further effort. Rather, we suggest that future work focus on documenting
   and comparing other ecological outcomes of fuel treatments in burned and
   unburned forest, such as effects on plant and animal diversity, soil
   conditions, and habitat heterogeneity. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   management'' to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and
   similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also
   compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same
   sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did
   riot use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely
   compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically
   used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not
   possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management
   activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where
   prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and
   hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population.
   Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve
   biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in
   the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of
   red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas
   national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one
   woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely
   without management. The very fragmented features of present-day
   landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of
   natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that
   historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb
   herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S.
   therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker
   is to persist.}},

   exposed to prescribed fire or fire surrogates (i.e. mechanical or
   herbicide-facilitated hardwood removal) as well as in fire-suppressed
   control sites and reference sites, which represented the historic
   condition. After initial treatment, all sites were exposed to over a
   decade of prescribed burning with an average return interval of
   approximately 2 years. We used population-level response of A.
   sexlineata as an indicator of the effectiveness of the different
   treatments in restoring habitat. Specifically, we compared mean numbers
   of marked adults and juveniles at treatment sites to that of reference
   sites. After 4 years, restoration objectives were met at sites treated
   with burning alone and at sites treated with mechanical removal of
   hardwoods followed by fire. After over 10 years of prescribed burning,
   restoration objectives were met at all treatments. We conclude that

   prescribed fires on small mammal populations, based on 4 years of

Abstract = {{Global biodiversity is threatened by invasive plant species. Without a
   thorough understanding of effective management strategies, minimizing
   their impacts while improving native species diversity will be
   challenging. Burning in fire-prone landscapes has been successful for
   managing invasive species and increasing native biodiversity, but it is
   unclear how specific fire regimes improve restoration practices in novel
   ecosystems where invasive plants have a similar growth phenology to
   native plants. We investigated fire as a restoration practice in the
   Northern Great Plains to decrease the cover of Kentucky bluegrass Poa
   pratensis (bluegrass), a perennial cool-season invasive grass
   phenologically similar to dominant native cool-season grasses, by 1)
   evaluating season of burn (early-growing season, late-growing season,
   and dormant season) in a field experiment to test differences in plant
   community composition and 2) manipulating fine fuels (3000-5000 kg
   ha(-1)) in an experimental approach to determine the effects of fire on
   plant survivability of selected native grasses and bluegrass. Bluegrass
   cover decreased 27\% on all field burned plots the first year post-fire.
   Three years post-fire, late-growing season and dormant season treatments
   had 35\% less bluegrass, whereas the early-growing season treatment was
   not significantly different from the control. Overall, fire altered the
   native plant community, with native plants more associated with burned
   plots. However, native plant community changes were only evident three
   years post-fire in late-growing season and dormant season burn
   treatments. In the experimental approach, native grasses and bluegrass
   experienced high rates of mortality (40-50\%) at fuel loads above 4000
   kg ha(-1) and heat dosages above 30,000 degrees C.sec, features commonly
   associated with early-growing season burns. Therefore, early-growing
   season burns meant to reduce bluegrass may also impact native plants
   dominant in the region. Invasive species management is complicated in
   novel ecosystems when invasive plants have similar growth phenologies to
   native species. Control efforts should consider how different management
   strategies impact invasive and native plants alike. We found that
   late-growing season and dormant season burns, along with higher fuel
   loads, decreased bluegrass cover. Determining mechanisms of control in
   fire-prone landscapes is a crucial step to improving invasive plant

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Shifting fire regimes are substantially changing North American forests.
   It is thus critical to understand how wildfires affect forest wildlife,
   especially for species managed for harvest and for species at risk of
   extinction. In particular, many populations of carnivores and ungulates
   are actively managed, so being able to anticipate their responses to
   future fires, or as burned forests regenerate, would be valuable for
   management and conservation. We examine how well the current literature
   addresses these important needs. We reviewed 131 papers published from
   1970 to 2019 that reported carnivore and ungulate responses to fires in
   North American conifer forests. We evaluated the study designs, fire
   attributes, species studied, and response variables measured. This
   literature contains considerable taxonomic bias, inconsistent reporting
   of fire and landscape characteristics, and a mismatch between research
   objectives and management needs. Of the 18 carnivore species studied
   post-fire, just three (grizzly bears Ursus arctos, Canada lynx Lynx
   canadensis, and American marten Martes americana) comprised nearly half
   of the literature (47.8\%). Few papers reported the spatial extents of
   fires being studied (32.6\% for carnivores and 38.2\% for ungulates).
   Most studies focused on recent burns (< 15 years post-fire) and
   monitored post-fire responses for fewer than five years. Few papers
   measured true population responses post-fire (6.7\% for carnivores and
   12.4\% for ungulates); the majority of papers focused on animal
   movements or habitat use (presence/absence or relative activity) rather
   than estimates of survival, recruitment, or population size. Our review
   also indicates that studying fires with a more diverse array of spatial
   extents, ages, and severities would be useful for most species.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Background Fires have been an important natural disturbance and
   pervasive evolutionary force in the boreal biome. Yet, fire suppression
   has made forest fires rare in the managed landscapes in Fennoscandia,
   causing significant habitat loss for saproxylic species such as
   polypores and insects. To better understand how the beetle community
   changes (species turnover) after a wildfire in a landscape with intense
   fire suppression, we monitored beetles with flight intercept traps the
   first 3 years as well as 12 years after a large wildfire in a national
   park in northern Sweden (a control/unburnt area was set up for the last
   year of sampling). Results Species composition changed significantly
   among all studied years with a continuous turnover of species following
   the wildfire. The indicator species analysis showed that year 1
   post-fire was mostly associated with cambium consumers and also the
   pyrophilous speciesBatrisodes hubenthali. Year 2 was the most abundant
   and species-rich year, withTomicus piniperdaas the most important
   indicator species. The indicator species year 3 were mostly secondary
   successional species, fungivores, and predators and were characterized
   by lower species diversity. Year 12 had higher diversity compared with
   year 3 but lower species richness and abundance. A control area was
   established during year 12 post-fire, and our analyses showed that the
   control area and burned area differed in species composition suggesting
   that the beetle community needs longer than 12 years to recover even
   after a low-intensive ground fire. Conclusion The wildfire area hosted
   several red-listed and fire-dependent species suggesting that after a
   century of landscape-level fire suppression in a semi-natural area, the
   reintroduction of fire benefits rare and pyrophilous species and still
   impacts species composition after 12 years. This study implies that fire
   has long-lasting effects on high latitudes and that prescribed burning
   has the potential to benefit biodiversity over decades in these
   landscapes while also highlighting the value of considering the whole
   species community and not only monitoring abundance and richness to
   assess biodiversity after management actions.}},

Abstract = {{Calluna vulgaris-dominated habitats are valued for ecosystem services
   such as carbon storage and for their conservation importance. Climate
   and environmental change are altering their fire regimes. In particular,
   more frequent summer droughts will result in higher severity wildfires.
   This could alter the plant community composition of Callus habitats and
   thereby influence ecosystem function. To study the effect of fire
   severity on community composition we used rain-out shelters to simulate
   drought prior to experimental burns at two Ca/lima-dominated sites, a
   raised bog and a heathland. We analysed species abundance in plots
   surveyed ca. 16 months after fire in relation to burn severity
   (indicated by fire-induced soil heating). We found that fire severity
   was an important control on community composition at both sites. Higher
   fire severity increased the abundance of ericoids, graminoids and
   acrocarpous mosses, and decreased the abundance of pleurocarpous mosses
   compared to lower severity fires. At the raised bog, the keystone
   species Sphagnum capillifolium and Eriophorum vaginatum showed no
   difference in regeneration with fire severity. Species and plant
   functional type beta-diversity increased following fire, and was similar
   in higher compared to lower severity burns. Our results further our

Abstract = {{Management strategies for the recovery of declining bird populations
   often must be made without sufficient data to predict the outcome of
   proposed actions or sufficient time and resources necessary to collect
   these data. We quantitatively reviewed studies of bird management in
   Canada and the United States to evaluate the relative efficacy of 4
   common management interventions and to determine variables associated
   with their success. We compared how livestock exclusion, prescribed
   burning, removal of predators, and removal of cowbirds (Molothrus ater)
   affect bird nest success and used meta-regression to evaluate the
   influence of species and study-specific covariates on management
   outcomes. On average, all 4 management interventions increased nest
   success. When common species and threatened, endangered, or declining
   species (as defined by long-term trend data from the North American
   Breeding Bird Survey) were analyzed together, predator removal was the
   most effective management option. The difference in mean nest success
   between treatment and control plots in predator-removal experiments was
   more than twice that of either livestock exclusion or prescribed
   burning. However, when we considered management outcomes from only
   threatened, endangered, or declining species, livestock exclusions
   resulted in the greatest mean increase in nest success, more than twice
   that of the 3 other treatments. Our meta-regression results indicated
   that between-species variation accounted for approximately 86\%, 40\%,
   35\%, and 7\% of the overall variation in the results of
   livestock-exclusion, prescribed-burn, predator-removal, and
   cowbird-removal studies, respectively. However, the covariates we tested
   explained significant variation only in outcomes among prescribed-burn
   studies. The difference in nest success between burned and unburned
   plots displayed a significant, positive trend in association with time
   since fire and was significantly larger in grasslands than in woodlands.
   Our results highlight the importance of comparative studies on

Abstract = {{Unburnt patches within a fire boundary may act as refuges for fauna,
   facilitating their survival and persistence within fire-prone
   landscapes. Unburnt patches can arise due to various processes,
   including topographic variation, fire behaviour, and fuel reduction from
   recent burning. However, the value of unburnt patches of differing
   characteristics to the post-fire persistence of faunal communities has
   rarely been examined. In this study, we examined the relative importance
   of fire history and severity in predicting the occurrence of birds in a
   burnt forest landscape. We conducted surveys in mixed eucalypt forest of
   south-east Australia, 2-3 years after a high intensity, landscape-scale
   wildfire (>200,000 ha). Sites (n = 91) were selected to encompass fire
   severity ranging from unburnt patches to stands of crown-burnt forest.
   Fire history prior to the wildfire was defined as short (<3 years) or
   long (>20 years) time-since-fire. Unburnt patches of long
   time-since-fire were important avian refuges, harbouring 20-40\% more
   species, up to 56\% more individuals and an assemblage that was distinct
   from that at all sites burnt by the wildfire, including low severity
   ground fire. No difference in species richness or composition was
   detected between sites in unburnt patches of short or long
   time-since-fire; but bird abundance was 20\% lower in patches of short
   time-since-fire. Unburnt and ground-burnt patches of short
   time-since-fire provided habitat for more species and had distinct
   assemblages from that of severely burnt sites. For sites severely burnt
   in the wildfire, there was no difference in avifaunal richness,
   abundance or composition between those burnt twice in rapid succession
   and those not burnt for >20 years. Together, these results highlight:
   (1) the particular importance of unburnt vegetation remaining within
   fire-affected areas as faunal refuges, and (2) the potential for recent
   planned burns to contribute to refuge habitat if it avoids severe
   burning in a subsequent wildfire. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Currently, the impact of introduced predators on small mammal population

   literature. In all likelihood though, single-factor explanation of
   population dynamics is inadequate, leaving gaps in our knowledge of the
   multitude of potential influences on small mammal abundance and
   occupancy patterns in time and space. Here, we investigated floristic
   gradients across four potential refuge sites of the central rock-rat,
   Zyzomys pedunculatus, a granivore rodent (50-120 g) that is endemic to
   central Australia and is categorised as critically endangered. The study
   took place in Tjoritja/West MacDonnell National Park in the MacDonnell
   Ranges bioregion. Floristic sampling was allocated across the four
   sites, the locations of which were predetermined by an established
   monitoring and management programme for the central rock-rat. Our aim
   was to examine the relationship between environmental gradients and
   floristic composition across the four sites, and thereby test the extent
   to which the patterns of food type and food availability can inform
   central rock-rat spatio-temporal dynamics. We found high site-scale
   floristic patterning that related foremost to elevation and then to
   antecedent rainfall and time-since-fire and fire-severity effects. To
   interpret these results, we applied the principles of refuge theory and
   we described a gradient from core refuge habitat to intermittent and
   then marginal habitat within the current central rock-rat stronghold
   area. Overall, our results implied a strong floristic basis to central
   rock-rat site occurrence, and they thus compel us to take explicit
   account of spatial (elevation) and temporal (rainfall-productivity and

Abstract = {{We followed the establishment and growth response of 13 commercial tree
   species to canopy opening, above-ground biomass removal, and
   experimental burns of low and high intensities in a lowland dry forest

   the most abundant commercial tree species. (1) Shade-intolerant species
   regenerated mostly from seed and had the highest survival and growth
   rates following high-intensity burns. (2) Shade-tolerant species were
   abundant in gap control and plant removal treatments. Treatments had
   little effect on the height growth of these species. (3) Individuals of
   root sprouting species were most abundant following plant removal and
   low-intensity burn treatments. Treatments had little effect on the
   height growth of these species. The wide variation in species responses
   to gap treatments found in this study not only reinforces the concept
   that species are distributed along a continuum of shade-tolerance
   levels, but that other aspects of species biology, such as seed
   dispersal type or sprouting behavior, further differentiate regeneration
   strategies. The variety of regeneration strategies found among the

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is a common management tool for upland hardwood
   forests, with wildlife habitat improvement an often cited goal. Fire
   management for wildlife conservation requires understanding how species
   respond to burning at different frequencies, severities, and over time.
   In an earlier study, we experimentally assessed how breeding bird
   communities and species responded to fuel reduction treatments by
   mechanical understory reduction, low-severity prescribed fires, or
   mechanical understory reduction followed a year later by high-severity
   prescribed fires in upland hardwood forest. Here, we assess longer-term
   response to the initial mechanical treatment (M), and a second
   low-intensity burn in twice burned (B2) and mechanical + twice burned
   (MB2) treatments and controls (C). Initial (2003) higher dead fuel
   loadings and consequently high-severity fires in MB2 created open-canopy
   structure with abundant snags, resulting in much higher species richness
   and density of breeding birds compared to other treatments. Relative
   bird density and richness remained much higher in MB2 after a second
   burn, but few changes were evident that were not already apparent after
   one burn. The initial (2003) burn in B2 had cooler, low-severity fires
   that killed few trees. Delayed tree mortality occurred in both burn
   treatments after one burn, and continued in both after a second
   low-intensity burn. In B2, this resulted in gradual development of a
   ``perforated,{''} patchy canopy structure with more snags. Abundance of
   total birds and most species in B2 was similar to C, but several
   additional species associated with open-forest conditions occurred at
   low levels, increasing richness in B2. In both burn treatments, burning
   temporarily reduced habitat suitability for ground-nesting birds. Bird
   communities in M were similar to C, as shrubs recovered rapidly. Results
   indicate that one or two relatively low-intensity burns with patches of
   hotter fire may result in gradual, subtle changes to canopy cover and
   structure that may slightly increase bird species richness over time. In
   contrast, a single high-intensity, high severity fire can create young
   forest conditions and a heterogeneous canopy structure that can be
   maintained by repeated burning and increase breeding bird relative
   abundance and richness by attracting disturbance-adapted species while
   retaining most other forest species. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   at all fires, fire severity was the most consistent predictor of
   non-native species cover. Non-native species cover was also correlated
   with high native species richness, low native dominant species cover,
   and high seeded grass cover. There was a positive, but non-significant,
   association of non-native species with fuel-treated areas at one
   wildfire. While there may be some potential for fuels treatments to

Abstract = {{Understanding mechanisms underlying fire regime effects on savanna fauna
   is difficult because of a wide range of possible trophic interactions
   and feedbacks. Yet, understanding mechanisms underlying fauna dynamics
   is crucial for conservation management of threatened species. Small
   savanna mammals in northern Australia are currently undergoing
   widespread declines and regional extinctions partly attributable to fire
   regimes. This study investigates mammal trophic and ecosystem responses
   to fire in order to identify possible mechanisms underlying these
   declines. Mammal trophic responses to fire were investigated by
   surveying mammal abundance, mammal diet, vegetation structure and
   non-mammal fauna dynamics in savannas six times at eight sites over a
   period of 3 years. Known site-specific fire history was used to test for
   trophic responses to post-fire interval and fire frequency. Mammal and
   non-mammal fauna showed only minor responses of post-fire interval and
   no effect of fire frequency. Lack of fauna responses differed from large
   post-fire vegetation responses. Dietary analysis showed that two mammal
   species, Dasyurus hallucatus and Isoodon auratus, increased their intake
   of large prey groups in recently burnt, compared to longer unburnt
   vegetation. This suggests a fire-related change in trophic interactions
   among predators and their prey, after removal of ground-layer
   vegetation. No evidence was found for other changes in food resource
   uptake by mammals after fire. These data provide support for a
   fire-related top-down ecosystem response among savanna mammals, rather
   than a bottom-up resource limitation response. Future studies need to
   investigate fire responses among other predators, including introduced
   cats and dingoes, to determine their roles in fire-related mammal
   declines in savannas of northern Australia.}},

Abstract = {{The Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) Wilderness of northern Minnesota,
   USA, ememplifies how fire management and natural disturbance determine
   forest composition and landscape structure at a broad scale.
   Historically, the BWCA (> 400,000 ha) was subject to crown fires with a
   mean rotation period of 50-100 y. Fires often overlapped, creating a
   mosaic of differently aged stands with many stands burning frequently
   or, alternatively, escaping fire for several centuries. The BWCA may
   never have reached a steady-state (defined as a stable landscape
   age-class structure). In the early 1900s, a diminished fire regime began
   creating a more demographically diverse forest, characterized by
   increasingly uneven-aged stands. Shade-tolerant species typical of the
   region began replacing the shade-in tolerant species that composed the
   fire-generated even-aged stands. Red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands are
   relatively uncommon in the BWCA today and are of special concern. The
   replacement of early-to-midsuccessional species is occurring at the
   scale of individual gaps, producing mixed-species multiaged forests. We
   used LANDIS, a spatially explicit forest landscape model, to investigate
   the long-term consequences of fire reintroduction or continuing fire
   absence on forest composition and landscape structure. Fire
   reintroduction was evaluated at three potential mean fire rotation
   periods (FRP): 50,100, and 300 y. Our model scenarios predict that if
   fire reintroduction mimics the natural fire regime (bracketed by FRP =
   50 and 100 y), it will be most successful at preserving the original
   species composition and landscape structure, although jack pine (Pinus
   banksiana) may require special management. With limited fire
   reintroduction, all of the extant species are retained although species
   dominance and landscape structure will be substantially altered. If fire
   remains absent, many fire-dependent species will be lost as local
   dominants, including red pine. The landscape appears to be in a state of
   rapid change and a shift in management to promote fire may need to be
   implemented soon to prevent further deviation from historic,
   presettlement conditions.}},

   Fire management that homogenises large areas of habitat through either

Abstract = {{Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) (MPB) outbreaks are
   increasingly prevalent in western North America, causing considerable
   ecological change in pine (Pinus spp.) forests with important
   implications for wildlife. We reviewed studies examining wildlife
   responses to MPB outbreaks and postoutbreak salvage logging to inform
   forest management and guide future research. Our review included 16
   studies describing MPB outbreak relationships with 89 bird species and 6
   studies describing relationships with 11 mammalian species, but no
   studies of reptiles or amphibians. We included studies that compared
   wildlife response metrics temporally (before versus after the outbreak)
   and spatially (across sites that varied in severity of outbreak) in
   relation to beetle outbreaks. Outbreaks ranged in size from 20,600 to >=
   10(7) ha and studies occurred 1-30 years after the peak MPB outbreak,
   but most studies were conducted over the short-term (i.e., <= 6 years
   after the peak of MPB-induced tree mortality). Birds were the only taxa
   studied frequently; however, high variability existed among those
   studies to allow many inferences, although some patterns were evident.
   Avian studies concluded that cavity-nesting species responded more
   favorably to beetle-killed forests than species with open-cup nests, and
   species nesting in the shrub layer favored outbreak forests compared
   with ground and open-cup canopy nesters that generally showed mixed
   relationships. Bark-drilling species as a group clearly demonstrated a
   positive short-term association with MPB epidemics compared with that of
   other foraging assemblages. Cavity-nesting birds that do not consume
   bark beetles (i.e., secondary cavity-nesting species and
   nonbark-drilling woodpeckers) also exhibited some positive responses to
   MPB outbreaks, although not as pronounced or consistent as those of
   bark-drilling woodpeckers. Mammalian responses to MPB outbreaks were
   mixed. Studies consistently reported negative effects of MPB outbreaks
   on red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). However, there is evidence
   that red squirrels can persist after an outbreak under some conditions,
   e.g., when nonhost tree species are present. For small mammal species
   associated with forest understories, responses may be most pronounced
   during the postepidemic period (>6 years after the peak of
   beetle-induced tree mortality) when snags fall to produce coarse woody
   debris. Postoutbreak salvage logging studies (n = 6) reported results
   that lacked consensus. Postoutbreak salvage logging may have an impact
   on fewer wildlife species than postfire salvage logging, probably
   because only host-specific tree species are removed after beetle
   outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{After decades of suppression, fire is returning to forests of the
   western United States through wildfires and prescribed burns. These
   fires may aid restoration of vegetation structure and processes, which
   could improve conditions for wildlife species and reduce severe wildfire
   risk. Understanding response of wildlife species to fires is essential
   to forest restoration because contemporary fires may not have the same
   effects as historical fires. Recent fires in the Chiricahua Mountains of
   southeastern Arizona provided opportunity to investigate long-term
   effects of burn severity on habitat selection of a native wildlife
   species. We surveyed burned forest for squirrel feeding sign and related
   vegetation characteristics to frequency of feeding sign occurrence. We
   used radio-telemetry within fire-influenced forest to determine home
   ranges of Mexican fox squirrels, Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae, and
   compared vegetation characteristics within home ranges to random areas
   available to squirrels throughout burned conifer forest. Squirrels fed
   in forest with open understory and closed canopy cover. Vegetation
   within home ranges was characterized by lower understory density,
   consistent with the effects of low-severity fire, and larger trees than
   random locations. Our results suggest that return of low-severity fire
   can help restore habitat for Mexican fox squirrels and other native
   wildlife species with similar habitat affiliations in forests with a
   historical regime of frequent, low-severity fire. Our study contributes

   changes in habitat and relative abundance of reptiles and amphibians

   anurans and all amphibians combined was greatest the first year after
   burning, mostly because captures of dwarf American toads (Bufo

   year after burning. Salamander captures were infrequent. Capture rates
   of most reptile and amphibian species declined over the 3-year sampling

   rates and little variation within habitat features among nest locations
   suggest white-headed woodpeckers were consistently selecting high

   in unmanipulated control areas, but densities of most taxa were not
   different in mowed treatment areas and control areas. Copepod densities
   were lower in burned treatment areas and oligochaete densities were
   lower in mowed treatment areas than in control areas. Midge (Diptera:

Abstract = {{Conservation management under human-induced changes to disturbance
   requires tools that can balance the needs of multiple species with
   different life histories and habitat requirements. Despite this urgent
   conservation need, landscape management typically focuses on single
   species and rarely includes the influence of disturbance-dependent
   vegetation transitions on multiple target species. In this paper, we
   describe a simulation model that achieves these goals, ranking possible
   fire management strategies from the viewpoint of protecting endangered
   coastal Southern Californian wildlife. The model involves the direct and
   indirect effects of fire on four animal species of conservation concern
   (coastal cactus wren, California gnatcatcher, Stephens' kangaroo rat,
   and Pacific pocket mouse) and five vegetation types (grass, coastal sage
   scrub, obligate seeding and resprouting chaparral, resprouting-only
   chaparral, and woodlands). Using historical fire records for the region,
   we predicted spatially-explicit fire frequencies and ignition
   probabilities. For these predictions, we simulated the location and
   extent of fires. Combining fire history and vegetation transition data
   from 1933 to 2003, we specified vegetation change probabilities under
   simulated fire regimes. Fire occurrence in a location altered habitat
   suitability, directly for each of the animal species and indirectly by
   changing the vegetative community. For some open-habitat species, such
   as the Stephens' kangaroo rat and Pacific pocket mouse, fairly frequent
   fire is required to reduce the density of invasive grasses and herbs.
   For other species, such as the coastal cactus wren and California
   gnatcatcher, frequent fire destroys the mature coastal sage scrub on
   which these species depend. The model includes a management component,
   allowing us to rank fire management actions. Over a 50-year time
   horizon, we find that populations of California gnatcatchers and Pacific
   pocket mouse are highly variable, and the pocket mouse is particularly
   prone to decline, despite prescribed burns designed to boost population
   viability. California gnatcatchers were also likely to be extirpated in
   the model, with relatively small extirpation risks for the cactus wren
   and Stephens' kangaroo rat. Despite conflicting requirements with
   respect to fire and differing life history traits among the four
   animals, we identified a beneficial strategy for our four target
   species, namely, controlling fire in coastal sage scrub. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Natural disturbance-based management and conservation strategies are
   needed to protect forest biodiversity. Boreal forests of northern Europe
   are typically clearcut and otherwise intensively managed for timber
   production. As a result, natural disturbances such as forest fires have
   became rare and the volume of dead wood has decreased. These changes
   have had a profound negative effect on species that depend on dead wood
   (saproxylic). Therefore, it is important to determine whether
   modifications of forest management methods can enhance the survival of
   these species. In our study area in southern Finland, we determined
   whether burning of logged sites and leaving trees (i.e., retention
   trees) on the sites benefited saproxylic, rare, and red-listed beetle
   species and how long the burned sites remained suitable habitat for
   these species. We surveyed the beetle fauna at 40 sites logged 1-16
   years previously, 20 of which were burned after logging. The abundance
   and species richness of saproxylic beetles were positively affected by
   burning, but the effect depended on the retention of trees in the
   otherwise clearcut stands. The difference between burned and unburned
   sites increased with the number of retention trees, and the effect of
   burning was not significant when there were fewer than approximately 15
   retention trees/ha. Most important, the species groups that were
   unlikely to persist in ordinarily managed forests (rare saproxylic and
   red-listed beetles), benefited strongly from burning and tree retention.
   The species richness of saproxylic beetles decreased with time since
   logging at both burned and at unburned sites. We conclude that burning
   of logged sites and leaving an adequate number of retention trees may be
   useful in the conservation of disturbance-adapted species and can be
   used to improve the environmental quality of the matrix surrounding
   protected areas. Unfortunately, sites remained high-quality habitat for
   only a short time; thus, a continuum of burned areas must be ensured.}},

Title = {{Does post-fire salvage logging affect foraging activity by rodents?}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Following wildfires, salvage logging is applied for silvicultural,
   safety or even aesthetic reasons. Such operations impact on biological
   legacies, impair natural vegetation recovery and may affect several
   animal species that depend on vegetation structure and specific plant
   resources. Rodents, such as wood and Algerian mice, use vegetation cover
   as protection against predators and are important prey, moderately
   effective seed dispersers and efficient seed predators. Different
   post-fire management strategies may either promote rodent abundance,
   enhancing their key biological roles, or result in low rodent abundance,
   creating a low seed predation window of opportunity when assisted
   regeneration of burnt forests is required. In order to evaluate the
   effects of post-fire salvage logging on plant-animal interactions, we
   compared plant regeneration, the availability of trophic resources
   (seeds and fleshy fruits), rodent foraging activity and rodent relative
   abundance between unlogged and logged burnt pine forests in the
   north-eastern Iberian Peninsula at different distances (up to 700 m)
   from the burnt area perimeter. The results show that vegetation
   recovered more slowly in salvage logged than in unlogged areas. Foraging
   activity of rodents increased both with the volume of woody debris,
   mainly derived from salvage logging, and with increasing foliage cover.
   Management strategies aimed at promoting the presence of rodents and
   associated biodiversity can, however, hamper assisted regeneration by
   seed sowing.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.)-dominated ecosystems
   in northern Lower Michigan is maintained by large, frequent,
   stand-replacing fires that often leave unburned forest strips (hereafter
   called ``stringers{''}) which may persist for decades on the post-fire
   landscape. Regional fire suppression practices have altered the fire
   regime, however, and structural variability has been further disrupted
   by extensive plantations designed to provide habitat for the
   federally-endangered Kirtland's warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii Baird).
   Jack pine plantations lack stringers and other structural heterogeneity
   found in fire-regenerated forests, and older live trees that comprise
   stringers are often harvested for timber. However, ecological effects of
   stringers on adjacent vegetation patterns and processes are poorly
   understood. We hypothesized that stringers act as post-fire refugia for
   plant species and provide a prolonged jack pine seed source for
   reseeding the burned landscape, and thus should be considered for
   inclusion in ecosystem-based management plans. We sampled data from four
   post-fire areas of different times-since-fire to investigate effects of
   stringers on post-fire plant community composition and stand structure.
   We evaluated plant community composition and compared stand density and
   age distributions at increasing distances from stringers to determine
   stringer effects on post-fire regeneration. In several burned areas,
   ground cover plant communities farthest from stringers differed from
   those both adjacent to and within stringers; areas burned relatively
   recently (12 and 32 years post-fire) showed the most pronounced
   differences. Structurally, several burned areas displayed broader
   sapling age distributions closer to stringers, suggesting that mature
   trees in stringers act as a prolonged seed source to the adjacent burned
   area. Thus, stringers not only influence immediate post-fire
   heterogeneity by retaining living trees on the burned landscape, but
   they also continue to provide inputs to the regenerating post-fire
   forest. Because the Kirtland's warbler population has recovered, and the
   warbler's delisting from endangered status is imminent, our results may
   be useful for guiding future ecosystem-based, adaptive forest management
   practices and, more broadly, retention patterns in stand replacing
   fire-prone areas.}},

   anthropogenic, fine-grained fire regime by comparing the effect of
   climatic variability on landscapes dominated by Martu Aboriginal hunting
   fires with those dominated by lightning fires. We show that Aboriginal
   fires are smaller, more tightly clustered, and remain small even when
   climate variation causes huge fires in the lightning region. As these

Abstract = {{The short- and long-term post-fire response patterns of small mammals,

   impact of fire and later post-fire recolonization. For reptiles there
   appears to be a strong relationship between the shelter and foraging
   requirements of species and their abundance in various successional
   states. The high incidence of burrowing in the mallee/heath amphibian
   fauna imparts considerable resilience to fire, and most species'
   abundance and distribution patterns seem more closely linked to moisture

Abstract = {{Fire is frequently applied as a management tool on both public and

   shrub stem density and percent canopy cover were similar among all
   treatments except high severity. Otherwise, fire severity had limited
   impacts on measured habitat characteristics. Following fires the
   densities of early-succession species such as eastern towhee (Pipilo
   erythropthalmus) and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) were greatest in
   areas of higher fire severity. A ground-nesting species (ovenbird

Abstract = {{Restoration programs for human-disturbed ecosystems rely on a good
   understanding of how recovery occurs. This requires elucidating the
   underlying succession process, which depends on species adaptations,
   their interactions, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of the
   disturbance. Using spiders, we aim to identify the drivers of succession
   after burning, commonly used in New Zealand native tussock grasslands,
   test the hypothesis of post-burning dominance of generalists over
   specialists, and test the presumption that managed summer burns are more
   detrimental than spring burns. We established a 7-year experiment, with
   spring and summer burn treatments and unburned control plots, and
   sampled annually before and after the burning. We identified changes in
   spider assemblages and their drivers using clustering and indicator
   value analyses, and we analysed the response of spider diversity and
   taxa through linear mixed-effect models. In both spring and summer
   burns, functional groups and diversity decreased and the density of
   individuals of generalist species increased. However, spring and summer
   burn treatments showed no differences in spider diversity and

Abstract = {{Sagebrush (Artemisia L.) taxa historically functioned as the keystone
   species on 1 090 000 km(2) of rangeland across the western United
   States, and Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp.
   wyomingensis Beetle and Young) is or was dominant on a substantial
   amount of this landscape. Wyoming big sagebrush provides habitat for
   numerous wildlife species. Nevertheless, Wyoming big sagebrush
   communities are commonly manipulated to decrease shrub cover and density
   and increase the productivity and diversity of herbaceous plants. We
   examined relationships between management-directed changes in Wyoming
   big sagebrush and greater sagegrouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), elk
   (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus), species commonly associated with these
   ecosystems. We focused on herbicide applications, mechanical treatments,
   and prescribed burning, because they are commonly applied to large areas
   in big sagebrush communities, often with the goal to improve wildlife
   habitats. Specifically, our objective was to identify treatments that
   either enhance or imperil sagebrush habitats for these wildlife species.
   The preponderance of literature indicates that habitat management
   programs that emphasize treating Wyoming big sagebrush are not supported
   with respect to positive responses by sage-grouse habitats or
   populations. There is less empirical information on ungulate habitat
   response to Wyoming big sagebrush treatments, but the value of sagebrush
   as cover and food to these species is clearly documented. A few studies
   suggest small-scale treatments (<= 60-m width) in mountain big sagebrush
   (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana {[}Rydb.] Beetle) may create
   attractive foraging conditions for brooding sage-grouse, but these may
   have little relevance to Wyoming big sagebrush. Recommendations or
   management programs that emphasize treatments to reduce Wyoming big
   sagebrush could lead to declines of wildlife species. More research is
   needed to evaluate the response of sagebrush wildlife habitats and
   populations to treatments, and until that time, managers should refrain
   from applying them in Wyoming big sagebrush communities.}},

Abstract = {{In fire-prone regions, wildfire influences spatial and temporal patterns
   of landscape heterogeneity. The likely impacts of climate change on the

   understanding how fire-induced heterogeneity may affect different
   components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as
   an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal
   mammals in fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia. First, we used
   a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative
   influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of
   arboreal mammals 2-3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the
   influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at
   severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of
   arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence,
   with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The
   occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by
   landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt
   and understorey-only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results
   support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve
   as refuges for fauna in the post-fire environment and assist
   recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance
   of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate
   spatial aspects of fire regimes (e.g., creation and protection of
   refuges) for fire management in fire-prone landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Current fire management practices in the fire-prone vegetation of
   south-eastern Australia are based mainly on the concept of hazard
   reduction via the use of periodic low-intensity fires to maintain the

   possible conflict between the requirements of fire management for hazard
   reduction and requirements for species conservation in the
   dry-sclerophyll shrublands and woodlands of the Sydney region. Our data
   indicate that potentially severe fire hazard (fine fuel loads of greater
   than or equal to t.ha(-1)) can reappear in the woodland and shrubland
   vegetation within 2-4 years after low-intensity fires, such as are
   typical of the fuel-reduction burns usually prescribed. Our data also
   show that low-intensity fires will have significant effects on the
   species composition of the communities if they occur with an inter-fire
   interval of less than 7-8 years, causing a significantly reduced
   abundance of long-lived woody shrub species.
   There is thus a clear conflict in south-eastern Australia between fire
   management practices based solely on prescribed burning for hazard
   reduction and the fire management practices necessary to maintain
   ecosystem biodiversity, and this conflict is greatest for fire-sensitive
   shrub species. The conflict between these two vegetation management
   objectives cannot be resolved by a simple compromise, as prescribed
   fires with inter-fire intervals any greater than 4 years will allow a
   potentially severe fire hazard to exist, while a burning regime with any
   inter-fire intervals less than 8 years will result in loss of
   biodiversity. This conflict means that it will probably not be possible
   to achieve simultaneously both hazard reduction and species conservation
   for any specified managed area. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Fuel treatments in fire-suppressed mixed-conifer forests are designed to
   moderate potential wildfire behavior and effects. However, the
   objectives for modifying potential fire effects can vary widely, from
   improving fire suppression efforts and protecting infrastructure, to
   reintroducing low-severity fire, to restoring and maintaining variable
   forest structure and wildlife habitat. In designing a fuel treatment,
   managers can alter the treatment's prescription, placement, and extent
   (collectively the ``treatment strategy{''}) to optimally meet one
   objective. However, the potential for trade-offs among different
   objectives is rarely tested systematically in fire-prone landscapes. To
   evaluate trade-offs in mechanical fuel treatment objectives related to
   fire severity, smoke production, forest heterogeneity, and avian
   wildlife habitat, we used a cross-platform modeling approach based on
   spatially explicit modifications of forest structure data for a 7820-ha
   landscape in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California. We examine whether (1) a
   more uniform treatment strategy aimed at fire hazard reduction (FHR) had
   negative effects on wildlife diversity, (2) a strategy focused on
   protecting the wildland-urban interface (WUI) left other portions of the
   landscape vulnerable to high-severity fire, and (3) increasing the
   extent of fuel treatments across the landscape led to greater reductions
   in fire severity and smoke emissions. When approximately 13\% of the
   landscape was treated, the proportion of the landscape vulnerable to
   high-severity fire decreased by 13-44\%, with the more uniform FHR
   strategy leading to greater reductions. Slight increases in predicted
   avian species richness that followed all treatment strategies were not
   closely linked to increases in canopy variability. The WUI protection
   strategy led to considerable reductions in fire severity at the
   landscape scale. Increasing the extent of treatments to 30\% of the
   landscape did little to further reduce the area vulnerable to
   high-severity fire, with additional reductions of 4-7\% depending on the
   prescription. However, increasing the extent of treatments reduced the
   extent of harmful downwind smoke impacts, primarily by reducing rate of
   fire spread. Treatment strategies will depend on specific management
   objectives, but we illustrate that trade-offs are not necessarily
   inherent in general outcomes of fuel treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term impacts of wildfires on animal populations are largely
   unknown. We used time-series data based on a tracking index, from
   coastal NSW spanning 28 years after a wildfire, to investigate the
   relative influence of habitat structure, species interactions and
   climate on post-fire animal population dynamics. The fire had an
   immediate impact on habitat structure, reducing and simplifying
   vegetation cover, which then underwent post-fire successional change
   including an increase and plateau in tree canopy cover; an increase,
   stabilization and then decline in shrub cover; and an increase in ground
   litter cover. Population changes of different animal species were
   influenced by different components of successional change, but there was
   also evidence that species interactions were important. For example,
   bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus and Perameles nasuta combined) increased
   concurrent with an increase in shrub cover then declined at a faster
   rate than a direct association with senescing shrub cover would suggest,
   while the feral cat (Felis catus) population changed with the bandicoot
   population, suggesting a link between these species. Potoroos (Potorous
   tridactylus) increased 10 years after the fire concurrent with the
   closing tree canopy, but there was also evidence of a negative
   association with feral foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Variation in rainfall did
   not have significant effects on the population dynamics of any species.
   Our results suggest that changes in habitat structure play a key role in
   the post-fire dynamics of many ground-dwelling animals and hence
   different fire regimes are likely to influence animal dynamics through
   their effects on habitat structure. However, the role of predatorprey
   interactions, particularly with feral predators, is less clear and
   further study will require manipulative experiments of predators in
   conjunction with fire treatments to determine whether feral predator
   control should be integrated with fire management to improve outcomes
   for some native species.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing wildfires in western North American conifer forests have led
   to debates surrounding the application of post-fire management
   practices. There is a lack of consensus on whether (and to what extent)
   post-fire management assists or hinders managers in achieving goals,
   particularly in under-studied regions like eastern ponderosa pine
   forests. This makes it difficult for forest managers to balance among
   competing interests. We contrast structural and community
   characteristics across unburned ponderosa pine forest, severely burned
   ponderosa pine forest, and severely burned ponderosa pine forest treated
   with post-fire management with respect to three management objectives:
   ponderosa pine regeneration, wildland fuels control, and habitat
   conservation. Ponderosa pine saplings were more abundant in treated
   burned sites than untreated burned sites, suggesting increases in tree
   regeneration following tree planting; however, natural regeneration was
   evident in both unburned and untreated burned sites. Wildland fuels
   management greatly reduced snags and coarse woody debris in treated
   burned sites. Understory cover measurements revealed bare ground and
   fine woody debris were more strongly associated with untreated burned
   sites, and greater levels of forbs and grass were more strongly
   associated with treated burned sites. Wildlife habitat was greatly
   reduced following post-fire treatments. There were no tree cavities in
   treated burned sites, whereas untreated burned sites had an average of
   27 +/- 7.68 cavities per hectare. Correspondingly, we found almost
   double the avian species richness in untreated burned sites compared to
   treated burned sites (22 species versus 12 species). Unburned forests
   and untreated burned areas had the same species richness, but hosted
   unique avian communities. Our results indicate conflicting outcomes with
   respect to management objectives, most evident in the clear costs to
   habitat conservation following post-fire management application.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of mammal species in Australia in the last 200 years has been
   attributed to many factors including habitat removal and altered fire
   regimes. Decline in tree condition could contribute further to the
   ongoing decline of mammals. Eucalyptus wandoo trees are currently
   undergoing a decline in condition that can result in a loss of canopy
   and other changes to the habitat. This paper examines the relationships
   between E. wandoo tree condition, habitat characteristics and small
   mammal species richness and abundance. Live-capture trapping was
   conducted at 24 E. wandoo sites at Dryandra State Forest and Wandoo
   Conservation Park, Western Australia. Condition and microhabitat
   variables of E. wandoo were recorded for each site. Generalised additive
   mixed models revealed a range of habitat and tree condition
   characteristics that influenced small mammal abundance and species
   richness, including site litter cover, crown dieback, understorey
   vegetation cover and tree density. The availability of coarse woody
   debris played a large role in explaining the abundance of Cercartetus
   concinnus and Antechinus flavipes, along with other microhabitat and
   tree condition variables, such as tree leaf litter and crown dieback.
   Epicormic growth, crown density and the distance to the drift fence from
   E. wandoo trees were the common variables in the best model for the
   abundance of Sminthopsis griseoventer. The decline in condition of E.
   wandoo and the subsequent modifications to the microhabitat are
   correlated with changes in the small mammal community. A better
   understanding of how the decline of E. wandoo impacts small mammal
   communities could improve management practices in E. wandoo woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Open pine-grasslands are one of the most threatened ecological

   habitat for many regionally declining bird species. While open pine
   grassland forests have diminished, acreage of pine plantations has
   increased throughout the Southeast, in part because of the U.S.

   whether fire and herbicide treatments would be effective in creating
   pine grassland structure in plantations suitable for a suite of
   declining early successional and pine grassland adapted species, we
   evaluated combined effects of selective herbicide and prescribed fire on
   plant and bird communities in thinned, mid-rotation pine stands
   established under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in Mississippi,
   USA. Within each of the 12 replicate sites, we assigned 2 paired 8.1-ha
   plots to either treatment (herbicide + prescribed fire) or control in a
   randomized complete block design. We applied treatments during autumn
   and winter of 2002 2003. During 2003-2006 breeding seasons, we
   characterized the bird community using repeated (4-6 repetitions/yr),
   standardized, 10-minute point counts from which we estimated species
   richness, total relative abundance, total avian conservation value, and
   density of select species. Managed plots exhibited reduced hardwood
   midstory and a greater abundance of grasses and forbs in the ground
   layer. Although avian species richness and total relative abundance were
   similar in treatment and control stands, we observed a shift in the bird
   community from closed-canopy forest species to early successional and
   pine grassland adapted species, many of which are experiencing
   population declines. We recommend thinning, hardwood midstory control,
   and prescribed burning within CRP pine plantations to provide habitat

Abstract = {{In western North American conifer forests, wildfires are increasing in
   frequency and severity due to heavy fuel loads that have accumulated
   after a century of fire suppression. Forest restoration treatments
   (e.g., thinning and/or burning) are being designed and implemented at
   large spatial and temporal scales in an effort to reduce fire risk and
   restore forest structure and function. In ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) forests, predominantly open forest structure and a frequent,
   low-severity fire regime constituted the evolutionary environment for
   wildlife that persisted for thousands of years. Small mammals are
   important in forest ecosystems as prey and in affecting primary
   production and decomposition. During 2006-2009, we trapped eight species
   of small mammals at 294 sites in northern Arizona and used occupancy
   modeling to determine community responses to thinning and habitat
   features. The most important covariates in predicting small mammal
   occupancy were understory vegetation cover, large snags, and treatment.
   Our analysis identified two generalist species found at relatively high
   occupancy rates across all sites, four open-forest species that
   responded positively to treatment, and two dense-forest species that
   responded negatively to treatment unless specific habitat features were
   retained. Our results indicate that all eight small mammal species can
   benefit from restoration treatments, particularly if aspects of their
   evolutionary environment (e.g., large trees, snags, woody debris) are
   restored. The occupancy modeling approach we used resulted in precise
   species-level estimates of occupancy in response to habitat attributes
   for a greater number of small mammal species than in other comparable
   studies. We recommend our approach for other studies faced with high
   variability and broad spatial and temporal scales in assessing impacts
   of treatments or habitat alteration on wildlife species. Moreover, since
   forest planning efforts are increasingly focusing on progressively
   larger treatment implementation, better and more efficiently, obtained
   ecological information is needed to inform these efforts.}},

Abstract = {{We studied habitat selection of grassland birds nesting on a 240-hectare
   grassland in south ern Maine, The site was commercially managed for
   blueberry (Vaccinium) production, which involved prescribed burning and
   herbicide spraying. These management practices profoundly affected
   vegetation physiognomy and influenced patterns of habitat selection of
   nesting species. There were clear differences in the types of habitat
   birds selected; four species preferred sites with both tall and short
   graminoid cover, whereas three species preferred sparse cover. Despite
   general similarities in each of these two groups, habitat selection for
   each species was generally characterized by a unique suite of vegetation
   features rather than distinct values for any particular habitat
   parameter.
   Territory densities of five breeding species were strongly influenced by
   management practices at this site. Species that preferred grass cover
   were adversely affected by herbicide spraying; these effects persisted
   for two to six years, depending on the number of herbicide applications
   and the species. In particular, Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna)
   densities had not recovered six years after spraying. In unsprayed
   plots, densities of six species declined with time since fire; densities
   of one species, Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla), increased with time

Abstract = {{There are contrasting opinions on the use of prescribed burning
   management in European grasslands. On the one hand, prescribed burning
   can be effectively used for the management of open landscapes,
   controlling dominant species, reducing accumulated litter or decreasing
   wildfire risk. On the other hand burning can have a detrimental impact
   on grassland biodiversity by supporting competitor grasses and by
   threatening several rare and endangered species, especially arthropods.
   We studied the effects of prescribed burning in alkaline grasslands of
   high conservation interest. Our aim was to test whether dormant-season
   prescribed burning can be an alternative conservation measure in these
   grasslands. We selected six sites in East-Hungary: in three sites, a
   prescribed fire was applied in November 2011, while three sites remained
   unburnt. We studied the effects of burning on soil characteristics,
   plant biomass and on the composition of vegetation and arthropod
   assemblages (isopods, spiders, ground beetles and rove beetles). Soil
   pH, organic matter, potassium and phosphorous did not change, but
   soluble salt content increased significantly in the burnt sites.
   Prescribed burning had several positive effects from the nature
   conservation viewpoint. Shannon diversity and the number of flowering
   shoots were higher, and the cover of the dominant grass Festuca
   pseudovina was lower in the burnt sites. Graminoid biomass was lower,
   while total, green and forb biomass were higher in the burnt plots
   compared to the control. The key finding of our study was that
   prescribed burning did not decrease the abundance and diversity of
   arthropod taxa. Species-level analyses showed that out of the most
   abundant invertebrate species, 10 were not affected, 1 was negatively
   and 1 was positively affected by burning. Moreover, our results suggest
   that prescribed burning leaving unburnt patches can be a viable
   management tool in open landscapes, because it supports plant diversity
   and does not threaten arthropods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Iconic sagebrush ecosystems of the American West are threatened by
   larger and more frequent wildfires that can kill sagebrush and
   facilitate invasion by annual grasses, creating a cycle that alters
   sagebrush ecosystem recovery post disturbance. Thwarting this
   accelerated grass-fire cycle is at the forefront of current national
   conservation efforts, yet its impacts on wildlife populations inhabiting
   these ecosystems have not been quantified rigorously. Within a Bayesian
   framework, we modeled 30 y of wildfire and climatic effects on
   population rates of change of a sagebrush-obligate species, the greater
   sage-grouse, across the Great Basin of western North America.
   Importantly, our modeling also accounted for variation in sagebrush
   recovery time post fire as determined by underlying soil properties that
   influence ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to
   invasion. Our results demonstrate that the cumulative loss of sagebrush
   to direct and indirect effects of wildfire has contributed strongly to
   declining sage-grouse populations over the past 30 y at large spatial
   scales. Moreover, long-lasting effects from wildfire nullified pulses of
   sage-grouse population growth that typically follow years of higher
   precipitation. If wildfire trends continue unabated, model projections
   indicate sage-grouse populations will be reduced to 43\% of their
   current numbers over the next three decades. Our results provide a
   timely example of how altered fire regimes are disrupting recovery of
   sagebrush ecosystems and leading to substantial declines of a widespread
   indicator species. Accordingly, we present scenario-based stochastic
   projections to inform conservation actions that may help offset the
   adverse effects of wildfire on sage-grouse and other wildlife
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Debate about the relative merits of single-species management versus
   more comprehensive approaches has intensified in recent years. In
   east-central Florida, USA, land managers use prescribed burns and
   mechanical cutting to manage and restore scrub habitat to benefit the
   imperiled Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens). However, these
   land-management techniques may affect non-target taxa, especially the
   threatened southeastern beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus
   niveiventris). We evaluated the collateral effects of single-species
   land management by trapping P. p. niveiventris and other small rodents
   in eighteen land-management compartments at Cape Canaveral Air Force
   Station, Florida during 2004-2005. Compartments were managed using
   either prescribed burns (N = 5), mechanical cutting (N = 6),
   checkerboarding (cut and uncut lanes alternating and overlapping,
   followed by a prescribed burn, N = 4) or left unburned and uncut for >50
   year (N = 3). P. p. niveiventris was significantly more abundant in
   compartments managed with prescribed burns (mean SE: 4.2 +/- 0.7
   individuals/transect) than those managed with cutting alone (1.0 +/-
   0.3) or not managed for >50 y (0.2 +/- 0.1 individuals/transect). In
   contrast, the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) tended to be more
   abundant in compartments managed with mechanical cutting alone (2.6 +/-
   0.4 individuals/transect) compared to the other three management
   strategies (prescribed burns; 1.5 +/- 0.4; checkerboarding, 1.1 +/- 0.3;
   not managed, 1.6 +/- 0.4 individuals/transect) but these differences
   were not statistically significant. Abundances of P. p. niveiventris and
   Florida Scrub-Jay breeding groups were positively correlated (r =
   0.655), suggesting that both listed species benefit from similar
   management techniques. Thus, the mosaic of burned and cut patches used
   to improve habitat for the Florida Scrub-Jay also benefits an endemic,
   non-target species. Single-species management may benefit multiple
   species when restoration improves their shared habitat, which in this
   case is an endangered, fire-dependent ecosystem: Florida scrub. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Forest restoration, fuel reduction, and wildlife conservation management
   requires understanding if, and how repeated prescribed fire, fire
   severity, or mechanical methods can promote goals. We examined breeding
   bird response to repeated fuel reduction treatments by mechanical
   understory reduction (twice; Mechanical-only), prescribed burning (four
   times; Burn-only), or mechanical understory reduction plus burning (then
   three subsequent burns; Mechanical + Burn). Initial burns were hotter in
   Mechanical + Burn than Burn-only resulting in heavy tree mortality,
   canopy openness, thick shrub density, and abundant snags lasting several
   years. Relative density and species richness of birds increased in
   Mechanical + Burn within three breeding seasons of high severity burns,
   and remained greater throughout subsequent burn. Increases were due to
   an influx of species associated with young forest conditions, with
   little change in most mature forest species. Repeated burning in
   Mechanical + Burn likely impeded forest maturation, allowing many
   scrub-shrub bird species to persist. Species richness in Burn-only did
   not differ from any treatment, but modest increases over time were
   apparent as structural heterogeneity increased with delayed tree
   mortality. Cavity-nester density was highest in Mechanical + Burn, but
   remained high even as snags fell to pretreatment levels. Ground-nester
   density was lower in Mechanical + Burn than Control and Mechanical-only,
   but ground-nesting species responded differently. Open woodlands were
   not created by any treatment due to persistent re-sprouting of
   top-killed trees and shrubs. We note that breeding birds appear to
   respond similarly to high-severity burns and silvicultural treatments
   with heavy canopy reduction, offering possible alternatives in managing
   upland hardwood forests for diverse breeding bird communities.}},

Abstract = {{High-severity forest fire often is presumed to adversely affect the
   occupancy of territories by California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis
   occidentalis) because these owls are associated with mature and
   old-growth forests. We used single-season, multi-state occupancy
   statistics to estimate site occupancy probability for Spotted Owls at 45
   historically occupied sites during the breeding season immediately
   following the 2013 Rim Fire, which was one of the largest forest fires
   on record in California. We quantified how occupancy probability was
   influenced by the amount of high-severity fire occurring in mature
   forested habitat within Protected Activity Centers (PACs). The
   model-averaged estimate of site-occupancy probability for at least a
   single owl was 0.922 (+/- SE = 0.073), which was higher than other
   published occupancy probability estimates for this subspecies in either
   burned or long-unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada. Mean site-occupancy
   probability for pairs was 0.866 (+/- 0.093), and most sites (33) were
   occupied by pairs. The amount of high-severity fire in the PAC did not
   affect pair occupancy. Occupancy probability by at least a single bird
   was negatively correlated with the amount of high severity fire in the
   PAC but remained >0.89 in 100\% high-severity burned PACs. These data
   add to observations that California Spotted Owls continue to use
   post-fire landscapes, even when the fires were large and where large
   areas burned at high severity, suggesting that owls are not generally
   negatively impacted by high-severity fire. Based on this and other
   studies of Spotted Owls, fire, and logging, we suggest land managers
   consider burned forest within and surrounding PACs as potentially
   suitable California Spotted Owl foraging habitat when planning and
   implementing management activities, and we recommend against logging
   burned forest within at least 1.5 km of nests or roosts for the
   conservation and recovery of this declining subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Peat-swamp forests harbour diverse animal communities, but they are also
   highly prone to forest fires. Between January 2017-February 2018, we
   carried out a camera trapping survey of animals in a mixed peat-swamp
   forest partly affected by El Nino driven forest fires in 1998. This
   survey was conducted in the Klias Forest Reserve (KFR), of western
   Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. In addition to natural regeneration, the burnt
   areas in this peat forest have undergone active forest rehabilitation
   since 2006, including enrichment planting with indigenous tree species.
   We identified 22 animal species (16 mammals and six birds) in the
   surveyed areas including common and rarer species of high conservation
   value. The richness of animal species detected in the rehabilitated
   (formerly burnt forest) and the nearby intact (unburnt) forest areas was
   generally comparable. The similarity of detected animal species
   composition in each forest condition was also high (74\% for all animal
   species combined; 86\% for mammal species). Additionally, six of the
   seven most frequently photographed species did not show any significant
   difference in daytime and nighttime activity patterns in the
   rehabilitated as compared to intact forest. Interestingly, mousedeer
   species (Tragulus napu and T. kanchil) were found to be significantly
   more active during the daytime in intact (unburnt) forest compared to
   the rehabilitated. However, we suspect higher daytime mousedeer activity
   in intact areas is a behavioural adaptation to increased hunting
   pressure at night in this forest rather than a result of the local
   habitat conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that the rehabilitated
   mixed peat-swamp forest burnt 20 years ago, acts as an important
   functional extension to the intact forest of the KFR ecosystem and
   provides useful additional habitat for animal conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration treatments have been widely advocated to address declining
   conditions in Pinus ponderosa forests throughout the western United
   States. However, few studies have examined treatment effects on
   individual plant species or whether responses differ for common species
   and uncommon species (those with low abundance in the
   community)-information that may be critical in managing for long-term
   biodiversity. We investigated understory species responses to
   restoration treatments in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests using a
   randomized block experimental design with three blocks and four
   treatments (control, burn-only, thin-only, and thin-burn). Understory
   vegetation was sampled before treatment and for three consecutive years
   after treatment. We used richness and an index of uniqueness to compare
   responses of common and uncommon native understory species among
   treatments, and indicator species analysis to identify individual
   species that responded to each treatment. Treatments that included
   thinning had significantly more unique species assemblages than the
   control. The thin-only treatment increased common native species
   richness, whereas all active treatments significantly increased uncommon
   native species richness over the control, especially the thin-burn.
   Generally, life-forms did not explain the responses of individual
   species, though in the final sampling year several graminoids were
   exclusively indicative of treatments that included thinning. Very few
   species had reduced abundance in the thinning and burning treatments by
   the final sample year, whereas many uncommon and short-lived species
   benefited from active treatments, especially the combined thin-burn
   treatment. Active restoration treatments in these forests may foster
   plant diversity by minimally impacting common species while
   significantly benefiting disturbance-dependent native species.}},

   intervals <= 2 years). Vegetation characteristics were measured at each
   nest (n = 37), within a 0.04-ha area immediately adjacent to nests, and
   at different time intervals following burns within a larger 20-ha area

   20-ha area 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after prescribed burns to compare

   began to deviate >= 6 months after fires such that >= 50\% of the values
   differed from the values recorded at nest sites. Results point to the
   importance of open vegetation structure at ground level and the need for
   frequent burning to maintain appropriate nesting habitat. Vegetation
   characteristics associated with nest sites appear to be highly ephemeral

Abstract = {{Across the southeastern United States, changing disturbance regimes
   threaten the integrity of pine flatwoods, reducing their suitability as
   habitat for a variety of avian species, many of which are considered of
   conservation priority. Prescribed burning and roller chopping are
   management practices widely used in pine flatwoods to control shrubs and
   increase the growth of herbaceous vegetation. However, the impacts these
   treatments have on this system and its associated avian communities are
   largely unknown. We examined the effects of prescribed burning and
   roller chopping on pine flatwoods avian communities using a paired
   sample approach. Avian communities were compared between treated (e.g.,
   burned) and untreated areas. We considered abundance and richness of all
   birds, but also groups of conservation concern, and those likely
   impacted by seasonal management practices (e.g., breeding and
   non-breeding categories, and woodland, successional-scrub, and grassland
   guilds). Dormant season burning resulted in decreases in avian species
   richness and abundance within the non-breeding, overwintering community.
   In situations where the maintenance or enhancement of this avian group
   is desired, growing season burning appears beneficial and should be used
   in preference to dormant season burning. Growing season burning
   benefited breeding avian communities, resulting in increases in species
   richness and abundance within this group. Dormant season roller chopping
   had no effect on species richness or abundance of any avian category or
   guild. Increases in abundance within breeding avian communities were
   observed following growing season roller chopping and a roller
   chopping/burning combination. Grazing, did not mediate the effects of
   prescribed burning or roller chopping on avian species richness or
   abundance. The use of dormant season burning is likely inappropriate in
   situations where conservation and management of non-breeding,
   overwintering species is a priority. The use of growing season roller
   chopping appears to provide a potential treatment alternative in
   situations where positive effects on breeding species are desired.
   Overall, maintenance of avian abundance and richness may be best
   achieved through the diverse application of prescribed burning and
   roller chopping based on season, frequency, and space. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   Ground Vegetation Species}},
Journal = {{BALTIC FORESTRY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{206-215}},
Abstract = {{As fire is inherent to boreal forest, sustainable forest management
   should consider emulating this disturbance type, taking into account the
   natural fire regime and the historical impact of humans. Fire often
   removes the dominant species and reveals mineral soil, which allows new
   species to spread on burned areas. Variable conditions provide habitat
   for many different species. Fire is sometimes necessary for the
   retention of species which do not regenerate in the absence of fire.
   Fire-damaged forest stands are often salvage logged. The necessity of
   this procedure can be disputed, as the cleaning may decrease
   biodiversity, favour pioneer herbs and shrubs which are highly
   competitive with tree regeneration, and disturb the ecosystem's nutrient
   cycle. The effect of burning and post-fire cleaning was studied. Ground
   vegetation was investigated during three subsequent years, 2004-2006, in
   Fire-damaged pine forest areas in North-western and Southeastern
   Estonia, both dry and wet site types. Fire occurred 10-12 years prior to
   the inventories in the first and 2-4 years in the latter. The vegetation
   survey took place on 2x2m squares undergoing three different treatments:
   Burnt and Cleaned (BC), Burnt and Uncleaned (BU) and Control (CO).
   Floral composition differed significantly between the treatments.
   Biodiversity was higher on burnt plots than in control plots in humid
   areas and lower in dry areas. On dry sites, Molinea caerulea and Calluna
   vulgaris benefit from cleaning, which may hamper pine regeneration.
   Prescribed burning on such sites can reduce the fire risk. On wet sites,
   there was no significant difference between pioneer and shade-tolerant
   species between cleaned and uncleaned areas. Whether cleaning after fire
   should be maintained as a management action therefore depends greatly on
   the forest site type and other circumstances, such as management
   objectives and surrounding stands.}},

Abstract = {{The spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) is a late-successional forest
   dependent species that is sensitive to forest management practices
   throughout its range. An increase in the frequency and spatial extent of
   stand-replacing fires in western North America has prompted concern for
   the persistence of spotted owls and other sensitive late-successional
   forest associated species. However, there is sparse information on the
   effects of fire on spotted owls to guide conservation policies. In
   2004-2005, we surveyed for California spotted owls during the breeding
   season at 32 random sites (16 burned, 16 unburned) throughout
   late-successional montane forest in Yosemite National Park, California.
   Our burned areas burned at all severities, but predominately involved
   low to moderate fire severity. Based on an information theoretic
   approach, spotted owl detection and occupancy rates were similar between
   burned and unburned sites. Nest and roost site occupancy was best
   explained by a model that combined total tree basal area (positive
   effect) with cover by coarse woody debris (negative effect). The density
   estimates of California spotted owl pairs were similar in burned and
   unburned forests, and the overall mean density estimate for Yosemite was
   higher than previously reported for montane forests. Our results
   indicate that low to moderate severity fires, historically common within
   montane forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, maintain habitat
   characteristics essential for spotted owl site occupancy. These results
   suggest that managed fires that emulate the historic fire regime of
   these forests may maintain spotted owl habitat and protect this species

Abstract = {{In an era characterized by recurrent large wildfires in many parts of
   the globe, there is a critical need to understand how animal species
   respond to fires, the rates at which populations can recover, and the
   functional changes fires may cause. Using quantified changes in habitat
   parameters over a similar to 400-yr post-fire chronosequence in an
   obligate-seeding Australian eucalypt woodland, we build and test
   predictions of how birds, as individual species and aggregated into
   functional groups according to their use of specific habitat resources,
   respond to time since fire. Individual bird species exhibited four
   generalized response types to time since fire: incline, decline,
   delayed, and bell. All significant relationships between bird functional
   group richness or abundance and time since fire were consistent with
   predictions based on known time-since-fire-associated changes in habitat
   features putatively important for these bird groups. Consequently, we
   argue that the bird community is responding to post-fire successional
   changes in habitat as per the habitat accommodation model, rather than
   to time since fire per se, and that our functional framework will be of
   value in predicting bird responses to future disturbances in this and
   other obligate-seeder forest and woodland ecosystems. Most bird species
   and functional groups that were affected by time since fire were
   associated with long-unburned woodlands. In the context of recent large,
   stand-replacement wildfires that have affected a substantial proportion
   of obligate-seeder eucalypt woodlands, and the multi-century timescales
   over which post-fire succession occurs, it would appear preferable from
   a bird conservation perspective if fires initiating loss of currently
   long-unburned woodlands were minimized. Once long-unburned woodlands are
   transformed by fire into recently burned woodlands, there is limited
   scope for alternative management interventions to accelerate the rate of
   habitat development after fire, or supplement the resources formerly
   provided to birds by long-unburned woodlands, with the limited exception
   of augmenting hollow availability for key hollow-nesting species.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfire spatial patterns drive ecological processes including
   vegetation succession and wildlife community dynamics. Such patterns may
   be changing due to fire suppression policies and climate change, making
   characterization of trends in post-fire mosaics important for
   understanding and managing fire-prone ecosystems.
   For wildfires in California's yellow pine and mixed-conifer forests,
   spatial pattern trends of two components of the post-fire severity
   matrix were assessed for 1984-2015: (1) unchanged or very low-severity
   and (2) high-severity, which represent remnant forest and
   stand-replacing fire, respectively. Trends were evaluated for metrics of
   total and proportional burned area, shape complexity, aggregation, and
   core area. Additionally, comparisons were made between management units
   where fire suppression is commonly practiced and those with a history of
   managing wildfire for ecological/resource benefits.
   Unchanged or very low-severity area per fire decreased proportionally
   through time, and became increasingly fragmented. High-severity area and
   core area increased on average across most of California, with the
   high-severity component also becoming simpler in shape in the Sierra
   Nevada. Compared to suppression units, managed wildfire units lack an
   increase in high-severity area, have less aggregated post-fire mosaics,
   and more high-severity spatial complexity.
   Documented changes in severity patterns have cascading ecological
   effects including increased vegetation type conversion risk, habitat
   availability shifts, and remnant forest fragmentation. These changes
   likely benefit early-seral-associated species at the expense of mature
   closed-canopy forest-associated species. Managed wildfire appears to
   moderate some effects of fire suppression, and may help buy time for

Abstract = {{Identifying relationships between habitat selection and population
   processes is important for habitat management and wildlife conservation.
   For prairie-obligate species, space use and demography in extant
   grasslands are influenced by habitat conditions caused by rangeland
   management practices associated with livestock production. Greater
   prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) are an indicator species for
   native tallgrass prairie ecosystems, but populations have declined in
   the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas, USA because of
   intensification of rangeland management practices, including annual
   prescribed fire and high stocking densities. Patch-burn grazing is a
   rotational system that provides heterogeneous habitats and can improve
   productivity of grassland birds, but the effects of grazing systems on
   habitat use or survival of greater prairie-chickens are unknown. We used
   3 types of survival analyses to investigate impacts of rangeland
   management on female greater prairie-chickens in the central Flint Hills
   during 2011-2013: Kaplan-Meier models and Cox proportional hazards to
   examine factors affecting annual survival rates, hazard functions to
   assess seasonal patterns of mortality, and Andersen-Gill models to
   explore the links between habitat selection and cause-specific mortality
   risk. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing had
   annual survival rates (0.610.07SE) that were 35\% higher than females on
   properties managed with annual burning and intensive early cattle
   stocking (0.45 +/- 0.06). Moreover, females that selected habitats
   associated with intensive management had increased mortality risk and
   were particularly vulnerable to avian predators, whereas females that
   selected habitats created by patch-burn grazing experienced lower
   overall mortality risk but were more vulnerable to mammalian predators.
   Overall mortality risk was significantly reduced under patch-burn
   grazing management, and widespread implementation of annual spring
   burning and intensive early stocking is likely depressing survival of
   greater prairie-chickens in the Flint Hills ecoregion. Our results join
   a growing body of evidence that patch-burn grazing can provide higher
   quality grassland habitats for native wildlife species than current
   rangeland management associated with intensive cattle production. (c)

   Our 3-year study provides strong evidence that habitat conditions
   generated by patch-burn grazing provide improved concealment for female
   greater prairie-chickens, resulting in lower mortality risk compared to

Abstract = {{Early stages of post-fire regeneration are sensitive to various factors,
   and can provide critical information for understanding forest responses
   to fire disturbance and projecting subsequent forest dynamics. Yunnan
   pine forests are the most widespread conifer forest type in Southwest
   China, and are frequently threatened by fire disturbance. Post-fire
   regeneration of this forest type, however, has not been previously
   studied. In this study, we investigated the early post-fire regeneration
   in mixed Yunnan pine forests five months after a severe burn in 2013 on
   Mt. Qinglongling, Yunnan Province, China. We found very active post-fire
   regeneration in the burned area likely facilitated by ample summer
   rainfall, with an average regeneration density of similar to 10(5) stems
   ha(-1). Species composition of the post-fire regeneration was highly
   similar to the pre-fire community-the similarity between the pre- and
   post-fire communities was 0.530 +/- 0.222. Elevation, pre-fire community
   type, and slope position were the three primary factors in the
   variations in regeneration density and species composition, while the
   impact of fire severity was low. The regeneration density of Pinus
   species and evergreen broadleaf species showed contrasting patterns
   across the environmental gradients, and the results implied that Yunnan
   forests are generally resilient to fire disturbance. The controlling
   impacts of the pre-fire community on post-fire regeneration are driven
   by the efficient regenerating strategies of dominant species, and are a
   comprehensive reflection of habitat conditions, which are primarily
   mediated by topographic features. Species regeneration strategies and
   the high resilience of the community to fire disturbance should be taken
   into account in fire prevention and management approaches for this
   forest type. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We tested whether the herpetofaunal response to clearcutting followed by
   site preparation was similar to high-intensity wildfire followed by
   salvage logging in sand-pine scrub. Herpetofaunal communities were
   compared in three replicated 5- to 7-year post-disturbance treatments
   were (1) high-intensity wildfire, salvage-logging, and natural
   regeneration; (2) clearcutting, roller-chopping, and broadcast-seeding;
   and (3) clearcutting and bracke-seeding. Animals were trapped over a
   14-month period using pitfall traps with drift fences. Microhabitat
   features were measured along line transects. Because amphibian (frog)
   occurrence appeared to be unaffected by treatment, this paper focuses
   only on reptile communities. Six species of lizards and one snake
   species were numerically dominant. Reptile species richness, diversity,
   and evenness did not differ among treatments or mature forest. Species
   composition differed markedly, however, between mature forest and
   disturbance treatments. Typical open scrub species such as Cnemidophorus
   sexlineatus, Sceloporus woodi, and Eumeces egregius, were dominant in
   high-intensity burn, roller-chopped, and bracke-seeded stands but scarce
   in mature forest, and they were positively correlated with bare sand and
   other micro-habitat features typical of open scrub. Conversely, Eumeces
   inexpectatus was most abundant in mature forest and was correlated with
   ground litter and other features typical of mature forest. With respect
   to the species sampled, especially the lizards (including endemic
   species) of open scrub, clearcutting appeared to mimic high-intensity
   wildfire followed by salvage-logging by creating microhabitat features
   such as bare sand. In a mirror image of the usual concept, forest
   maturation historically served as the fragmenting agent of an extensive
   open-scrub landscape matrix that was maintained by high-intensity
   wildfire. Hence, the patchwork of age classes created by current
   clearcutting patterns could serve as a barrier to lizard dispersal and
   impede metapopulation dynamics. The absence of a true control
   (unsalvaged burns) suggests caution in interpreting the results of this

Abstract = {{Western juniper (Junipenis occidentalis Hook) encroachment and exotic

   communities decrease ecosystem services and degrade ecosystem function.
   Traditionally, these compositional changes were largely confined to
   separate areas, but more sagebrush communities are now simultaneously
   being altered by juniper and exotic annual grasses. Few efforts have
   evaluated attempts to restore these sagebrush communities. The Crooked
   River National Grassland initiated a project to restore
   juniper-encroached and annual grass-invaded sagebrush steppe using
   summer (mid-July) applied prescribed fires and postfire seeding.
   Treatments were unburned, burned, burned and seeded with a native seed
   mix, and burned and seeded with an introduced seed mix. Prescribed
   burning removed all juniper and initially reduced medusahead cover but
   did not influence cheatgrass cover. Neither the native nor introduced
   seed mix were successful at increasing large bunchgrass cover, and 6 yr
   post fire, medusahead cover was greater in burned treatments compared
   with the unburned treatment. Large bunchgrass cover and biological soil
   crusts were less in treatments that included burning. Exotic forbs and
   bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa L), an exotic grass, were greater in
   burned treatments compared with the unburned treatment. Sagebrush
   communities that are both juniper encroached and exotic annual grass
   invaded will need specific management of both juniper and annual
   grasses. We suggest that additional treatments, such as pre-emergent
   herbicide control of annuals and possibly multiple seeding events, are
   necessary to restore these communities. We recommend an adaptive
   management approach in which additional treatments arc applied on the

Abstract = {{Grassland managers and scientists are increasingly interested in
   cost-effective alternative ways of grassland biodiversity conservation.
   Prescribed burning is a promising management tool which should be
   integrated in the planning of management efforts. In addition,
   small-scale prescribed burning is an effective fire suppression strategy
   to decrease the serious negative impacts of uncontrolled burnings on
   ecosystems and human life. Prescribed burning forms an integral part of
   the North-American grassland management practice, while in Europe it is
   rarely applied, despite the fact that uncontrolled burning occurs
   frequently in some regions. Our goal was to evaluate the use of
   prescribed burning as a promising but neglected management tool in
   European grasslands. We found that European studies on prescribed
   burning of grasslands are scarce and we conclude that annual burning is
   usually not an appropriate option for the conservation of species-rich
   grasslands. We reviewed burning studies from North-America to identify
   findings which might be adapted to the European grassland conservation
   strategy. In North-America, contrary to Europe, the application of
   burning is fine tuned in terms of frequency and timing, and usually
   combined with other restoration measures (grazing or seed sowing). Thus,
   we conclude that with the application of carefully designed prescribed
   burning, multiple conservation goals, e. g. invasion control and
   enhancing landscape-level heterogeneity, can be linked with an effective
   fire suppression strategy. We emphasize that for the application of
   prescribed burning in Europe, the general findings of carefully designed
   case studies should be combined with the practical knowledge of
   conservation managers concerning the local application circumstances to
   reach specific management objectives.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted bird surveys in 10 of the first 11 years following a
   mixed-severity fire in a dry, low-elevation mixed-conifer forest in

   severity and time-since-fire, and then comparing detection rates for
   species inside 15 combinations of fire severity and time-since-fire,
   with their rates of detection in unburned (but otherwise similar) forest
   outside the burn perimeter, we were able to assess more nuanced effects
   of fire on 50 bird species. A majority of species (60\%) was detected
   significantly more frequently inside than outside the burn. It is likely
   that the beneficial effects of fire for some species can be detected
   only under relatively narrow combinations of fire severity and
   time-since-fire. Because most species responded positively and uniquely
   to some combination of fire severity and time-since-fire, these results
   carry important management implications. Specifically, the variety of
   burned-forest conditions required by fire-dependent bird species cannot
   be created through the application of relatively uniform low-severity

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean area, different post-fire management strategies are

   The aim of this work was to determine whether forest management of a
   recently burned area dominated by a vigorous resprouting tree species
   (Arbutus unedo L.) affects ant communities.
   Ant communities, sampled using pitfall traps, were examined from
   unmanaged and selective thinning coppices of A. unedo. Ants are here
   used as bioindicators of ecosystem health and surrogates for other
   animal groups.
   Very limited effects of these post-fire management strategies on the
   structure and composition of ant communities were found. The lack of
   effects could be due to the reported small changes in physical
   conditions among treatments; or either, the most sensitive ant species
   to these post-fire management treatments might be the same ones affected
   by fire and, consequently, the ant species that would potentially be
   affected most were no longer in the study area.
   The lack of any significant effects caused by these post-fire management

Abstract = {{Context Identification of key threats to endangered species is vital for
   devising effective management strategies, but may be hindered when
   relevant data is limited. A population viability approach may overcome
   this problem.
   Aims We aimed to determine the population viability of endangered
   northern bettongs (Bettongia tropica) in north-eastern Australia. We
   also assessed the key threats to the population resilience and how the
   population viability responds to increases in mortality rates and
   changes in fire and drought frequency.
   Methods Using population viability analysis (PVA) we modelled survival
   probability of B. tropica populations under likely scenarios, including:
   (1) increased predation; (2) changes in drought and fire frequency
   predicted with anthropogenic climate change; and (3) synergistic effects
   of predation, fire and drought.
   Key results Population viability models suggest that populations are
   highly vulnerable to increases in predation by feral cats (Felis catus),
   and potentially red fox (Vulpes vulpes) should they colonise the area,
   as juvenile mortality is the main age class driving population
   viability. If B. tropica become more vulnerable to predators during
   post-fire vegetation recovery, more frequent fires could exacerbate
   effects of low-level cat predation. In contrast, it was predicted that
   populations would be resilient to the greater frequency of droughts
   expected as a result of climate change, with high probabilities of
   extinctions only predicted under the unprecedented and unlikely scenario
   of four drought years in 10. However, since drought and fire are
   interlinked, the impacts of predation could be more severe with climate
   change should predation and fire interact to increase B. tropica
   mortality risk.
   Conclusion Like other Potoroids, B. tropica appear highly vulnerable to
   predation by introduced mammalian predators such as feral cats.
   Implications Managers need information allowing them to recognise
   scenarios when populations are most vulnerable to potential threats,
   such as drought, fire and predation. PVA modelling can assess scenarios
   and allow pro-active management based on predicted responses rather than
   requiring collection of extensive field data before management actions.
   Our analysis suggests that assessing and controlling predator
   populations and thereby minimising predation, particularly of juveniles,
   should assist in maintaining stability of populations of the northern
   bettong.}},

   m(3)/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned in 2001.
   We sampled beetles with 10 flight-intercept traps on each site during

   total sample of 153,449 individuals representing 1, 160 beetle species

   The richness of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased in the

   REGIONS, USA}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},

Pages = {{127-159}},
Abstract = {{Fire is being prescribed and used increasingly to promote ecosystem
   restoration (e.g., oak woodlands and savannas) and to manage wildlife
   habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian regions, USA. However,
   questions persist as to how fire affects hardwood forest communities and
   associated wildlife, and how fire should be used to achieve management
   goals. We provide an up-to-date review of fire effects on various
   wildlife species and their habitat in the Central Hardwoods and
   Appalachians. Documented direct effects (i.e., mortality) on wildlife
   are rare. Indirect effects (i.e., changes in habitat quality) are
   influenced greatly by light availability, fire frequency, and fire
   intensity. Unless fire intensity is great enough to kill a portion of
   the overstory, burning in closed-canopy forests has provided little
   benefit for most wildlife species in the region because it doesn't
   result in enough sunlight penetration to elicit understory response.
   Canopy reduction through silvicultural treatment has enabled managers to
   use fire more effectively. Fire intensity must be kept low in hardwoods
   to limit damage to many species of overstory trees. However, wounding or
   killing trees with fire benefits many wildlife species by allowing
   increased sunlight to stimulate understory response, snag and subsequent
   cavity creation, and additions of large coarse woody debris. In general,
   a fire-return interval of 2 yr to 7 yr benefits a wide variety of
   wildlife species by providing a diverse structure in the understory;
   increasing browse, forage, and soft mast; and creating snags and
   cavities. Historically, dormant- season fire was most prevalent in these
   regions, and it still is when most prescribed fire is implemented in
   hardwood systems as burn-days are relatively few in the growing season
   of May through August because of shading from leaf cover and high fuel
   moisture. Late growing- season burning increases the window for burning,
   and better control on woody composition is possible. Early
   growing-season fire may pose increased risk for some species, especially
   herpetofauna recently emerged from winter hibernacula (April) or forest
   songbirds that nest in the understory (May to June). However, negative
   population-level effects are unlikely unless the burned area is
   relatively large and early growing-season fire is used continually. We
   did not find evidence that fire is leading to population declines for
   any species, including Endangered Species Act (ESA)- listed species
   (e.g., Indiana bat {[}Myotissodalis Mill. Allen] or northern long-eared
   bat {[}M. septentrionalis Trouess.]). Instead, data indicate that fire
   can enhance habitat for bats by increasing suitability of foraging and
   day-roost sites. Similarly, concern over burning and displacement of
   woodland salamanders (Plethodontidae), another taxa of heightened
   conservation concern, is alleviated when fire is prescribed along
   ecologically appropriate aspect and slope gradients and not forced into
   mesic, high site index environments where salamanders are most common.
   Because topography across the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians is
   diverse, we contend that applying fire on positions best suited for
   burning is an effective approach to increase regional landscape
   heterogeneity and biological diversity. Herein, we offer prescriptive
   concepts for burning for various wildlife species and guilds in the
   Central Hardwoods and Appalachians.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on
   cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest
   reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged
   patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife
   Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting
   birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots,
   but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one
   species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of
   the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots.
   Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in
   the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent
   species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides
   dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances
   in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still
   more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum
   number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters,
   which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a
   reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site
   availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly
   selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary
   cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots,
   nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary
   cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that
   typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance
   of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially
   populations of primary cavity-nesting species.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence of wildlife species in fire-prone ecosystems is under
   increasing pressure from global change, including alterations in fire
   regimes caused by climate change. However, unburned islands might act to
   mitigate negative effects of fire on wildlife populations by providing
   habitat in which species can survive and recolonize burned areas.
   Nevertheless, the characteristics of unburned islands and their role as
   potential refugia for the postfire population dynamics of wildlife
   species remain poorly understood. We used a newly developed unburned
   island database of the northwestern United States from 1984 to 2014 to
   assess the postfire response of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus), a large gallinaceous bird inhabiting the sagebrush
   ecosystems of North America, in which wildfires are common.
   Specifically, we tested whether prefire and postfire male attendance
   trends at mating locations (leks) differed between burned and unburned
   areas, and to what extent postfire habitat composition at multiple
   scales could explain such trends. Using time-series of male counts at
   leks together with spatially explicit fire history information, we
   modeled whether male attendance was negatively affected by fire events.
   Results revealed that burned leks often exhibit sustained decline in
   male attendance, whereas leks within unburned islands or >1.5 km away
   from fire perimeters tend to show stable or increasing trends. Analyses
   of postfire habitat composition further revealed that sagebrush
   vegetation height within 0.8 km around leks, as well elevation within
   0.8 km, 6.4 km, and 18 km around leks, had a positive effect on male
   attendance trends. Moreover, the proportion of the landscape with
   cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover >8\% had negative effects on male
   attendance trends within 0.8 km, 6.4 km, and 18 km of leks,
   respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that
   maintaining areas of unburned vegetation within and outside fire
   perimeters may be crucial for sustaining sage-grouse populations
   following wildfire. The role of unburned islands as fire refugia
   requires more attention in wildlife management and conservation planning
   because their creation, protection, and maintenance may positively
   affect wildlife population dynamics in fire-prone ecosystems.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Management strategies to reduce the risks to human life and property
   from wildfire commonly involve burning native vegetation. However,
   planned burning can conflict with other societal objectives such as
   human health and biodiversity conservation. These conflicts are likely
   to intensify as fire regimes change under future climates and as growing
   human populations encroach farther into fire-prone ecosystems. Decisions
   about managing fire risks are therefore complex and warrant more
   sophisticated approaches than are typically used. We applied a
   multicriteria decision making approach (MCDA) with the potential to
   improve fire management outcomes to the case of a highly populated,
   biodiverse, and flammable wildland-urban interface. We considered the
   effects of 22 planned burning options on 8 objectives: house protection,
   maximizing water quality, minimizing carbon emissions and impacts on
   human health, and minimizing declines of 5 distinct species types. The
   MCDA identified a small number of management options (burning forest
   adjacent to houses) that performed well for most objectives, but not for
   one species type (arboreal mammal) or for water quality. Although MCDA
   made the conflict between objectives explicit, resolution of the problem
   depended on the weighting assigned to each objective. Additive weighting
   of criteria traded off the arboreal mammal and water quality objectives
   for other objectives. Multiplicative weighting identified scenarios that
   avoided poor outcomes for any objective, which is important for avoiding
   potentially irreversible biodiversity losses. To distinguish reliably
   among management options, future work should focus on reducing
   uncertainty in outcomes across a range of objectives. Considering
   management actions that have more predictable outcomes than landscape
   fuel management will be important. We found that, where data were
   adequate, an MCDA can support decision making in the complex and often
   conflicted area of fire management.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{214-230}},
Abstract = {{Conservation assessment information prepared to support the listing or
   recovery of threatened species provides a comprehensive evidence base
   for analysing the status of, and threats to, threatened species, as
   required for indicator-based national and international state of the
   forests' reporting. A database on threatened forest-dwelling species in
   Australia was therefore developed for the National Forest Inventory,
   from an existing database of forest-dwelling species. At December 2012,
   a total of 1352 forest-dwelling plant and animal species were listed as
   Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable under the national
   Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, with a
   further 79 forest-dwelling species listed as Extinct. Forest-dwelling
   species comprise 80\% of the threatened species listed under this Act,
   while forest-dependent species represent 48\%. The main driver of these
   high proportions is the estimated halving of Australia's forest area
   since European settlement in 1788, primarily as a result of forest
   clearing for agricultural, urban, industrial and infrastructure
   development, and the consequent focus on forest-dwelling threatened
   species in conservation planning and research. The most common
   categories of threat to forest-dwelling species identified in the
   listing documentation were land-use change resulting from agricultural
   clearing and urbanisation, unsuitable fire regimes, invasive species,
   and the combinations of these. In comparison, forestry operations as a
   category of threat ranked 9(th) out of 11 threat categories for
   forest-dwelling fauna and 11(th) out of 11 threat categories for
   forest-dwelling flora. Genetics threats (e.g. small population size,
   fragmentation, low genetic diversity, hybridisation or low fecundity)
   are given as major listing reasons for many forest-dwelling species,
   particularly birds, invertebrates and plants. Specifying effective
   approaches to measuring the performance of recommended management
   measures in threatened species listing statements and recovery plans
   would improve reporting of indicators using threatened species.
   Increased monitoring and reporting of the status of threatened species
   in the reserve system, and of threats impacting on species in the
   reserve system, would also significantly improve Australia's capacity to
   report on the status of and trends for threatened forest-dwelling
   species. Collection of rigorous data that is usable for monitoring
   population trends of threatened forest-dwelling species will continue to
   be important for their ongoing management, as well as rigorous research
   into the threats that impact on these species.}},

   prairie}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{709-720}},
Abstract = {{Altered fire regimes play a key role in shrub expansion in grasslands
   worldwide. We assessed how season and type or intensity of fire affected
   the growth and demography of Rhus glabra, a common woody invader in
   North American mesic grasslands. Fire during any season killed 99\% of
   ramets but stimulated new ramet recruitment from belowground buds,
   resulting in a near-complete turnover of ramet populations. During the
   first 2 years following fire, populations on spring-burned sites had the
   greatest post-fire ramet densities and population growth rates, and
   winter-and spring-burned populations showed the highest resprouting
   rates. However, after 10 years, R. glabra cover on summer-burned sites
   was 3.5 times greater than on autumn-or winter-burned treatments. Thus,
   short-term post-fire responses may not be good predictors of long-term
   changes in abundance. Low-intensity spring backfires resulted in the
   highest ramet population growth rates, whereas high-intensity headfires
   in any season resulted in slower growth, and populations burned with
   low-intensity winter fires declined. In addition, season of fire
   influenced browsing pressure, suggesting that plant responses may be
   partially a result of indirect effects of fire on rates of herbivory.
   Overall, our results demonstrate that the application of frequent autumn
   or winter backfires is an effective management tool for limiting R.
   glabra expansion in grasslands, and that long-term data are critical for
   management decision-making, particularly in systems characterised by
   high interannual climate variability.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of invasive plant control on native animals are rarely

   species of (1) the abundance of the invasive Bitou Bush,
   Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and (2) a Bitou Bush control
   program, which involved repeated herbicide spraying interspersed with
   prescribed burning. We found that overall species richness of birds,
   mammals, and reptiles and the majority of individual vertebrate species
   were unresponsive to Bitou Bush cover and the number of plants. Two
   species including the nationally endangered Eastern Bristlebird
   (Dasyurus brachypterus) responded positively to measures of native
   vegetation cover following the control of Bitou Bush. Analyses of the
   effects of different components of the treatment protocol employed to
   control Bitou Bush revealed (1) no negative effects of spraying on
   vertebrate species richness; (2) negative effects of spraying on only
   one individual species (Scarlet Honeyeater); and (3) lower bird species
   richness but higher reptile species richness after fire. The occupancy
   of most individual vertebrates species was unaffected by burning; four
   species responded negatively and one positively to fire. Our study
   indicated that actions to remove Bitou Bush generally have few negative

Abstract = {{Medicinal use of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) fruits in treating benign
   prostatic hypertrophy has driven a recent sharp increase in fruit
   harvesting. At the same time, saw palmetto often is considered a
   keystone species, serving as habitat or a food source for several
   hundred mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and insect species. Due to
   harvesting pressure on this ecologically important, non-cultivated
   species, land management practices that produce environmentally
   sustainable harvests are needed. As part of research focusing on use of
   controlled burning as a management tool, we investigated effects of
   burning season and frequency on saw palmetto flowering and fruiting in
   32 pine flatwoods sites in central and southwest Florida from 1997 to
   1999. The study was conducted as two repeated measures experiments, each
   involving 16 sites. Each experiment included two among-subjects factors
   - burning season and past burning frequency - and one within-subjects
   factor -year- with four replications of each treatment combination. For
   both experiments, growing season (i.e., April-July) burns had high
   flowering levels the first year after burning (mean proportion of saw
   palmettos flowering = 0.49, n = 16 sites), but decreased the second year
   after burning (mean proportion flowering = 0.15, n = 16 sites), while
   winter (i.e., November-February) burns had intermediate levels of
   flowering during both the first and second years after burning (mean
   proportions flowering = 0.21 and 0.28 for first and second years after
   burning, n = 16 sites). Although most flowering occurred during April
   and May, flowering occurred 2-5 months after winter burns, but did not
   occur until 9-12 months after growing season burns. During the 1997-1998
   experiment, fruit infection by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides
   caused a fruiting failure in all sites. During the 1998-1999 experiment,
   fruit yields were higher in growing season burns only in infrequently
   burned (i.e., burned less often than every 5 years) sites, and only in
   1998 (mean fruit yields = 325 kg/ha and 0.25 kg/ha for growing season,
   infrequently burned sites and winter, infrequently burned sites; n = 4
   sites in each group). Frequently burned (i.e., burned every 2-3 years)
   sites generally had low fruit yields (mean fruit yields = 163 kg/ha and
   242 kg/ha for frequently burned sites in 1998 and 1999; n = 8 sites).
   Although controlled burning can be an effective management tool in
   producing economically sustainable saw palmetto fruit harvests, land
   managers also must consider ecological needs of other plant and animal
   species when planning environmentally sustainable burning regimes. (c)

Abstract = {{We compared the effects of 3 fuel reduction techniques and a control on

   experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3
   replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North
   Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical
   understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3)
   mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments
   in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub
   cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls.
   Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn
   treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter
   burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not
   detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species
   richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo
   buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis),
   increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year
   delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after
   treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers
   (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus)
   declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to
   understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most
   species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag
   density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions,
   and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn
   treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species
   richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy
   intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory
   removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the
   mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy
   tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used
   as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open
   habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have
   short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the
   ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.}},

Abstract = {{Most federal legislation and policies (e. g., the Wilderness Act,
   Endangered Species Act, National Forest Management Act) fail to speak
   directly to the need for old-growth protection, recruitment, and
   restoration on federal lands. Various policy and attitudinal barriers
   must be changed to move beyond the current situation. For example, in
   order to achieve the goal of healthy old growth in frequent-fire
   forests, the public must be educated regarding the evolutionary nature
   of these ecosystems and persuaded that collaborative action rather than
   preservation and litigation is the best course for the future of these
   forests. Land managers and policy makers must be encouraged to look
   beyond the single-species management paradigm toward managing natural
   processes, such as fire, so that ecosystems fall within the natural
   range of variability. They must also see that, given their recent
   evidence of catastrophic fires, management must take place outside the
   wildland-urban interface in order to protect old-growth forest
   attributes and human infrastructure. This means that, in some wilderness
   areas, management may be required. Land managers, researchers, and
   policy makers will also have to agree on a definition of old growth in
   frequent-fire landscapes; simply adopting a definition from the mesic
   Pacific Northwest will not work. Moreover, the culture within the
   federal agencies needs revamping to allow for more innovation,
   especially in terms of tree thinning and wildland fire use. Funding for

Abstract = {{The changing demographics of rural landowners have the potential to

   participation in a variety of wildlife management practices. Wildlife
   management practices most commonly implemented by landowners were
   providing supplemental feed (21.8\%), mowing to improve habitat
   (16.2\%), erecting nesting boxes (14.7\%), and planting food plots

Abstract = {{Plans exist to restore the are-dependent pine (Pinus spp.)-grassland

   improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected other breeding bird
   species. We compared avian species frequency of occurrence and abundance
   during 2 breeding seasons in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in
   treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and
   prescribed fire. Total bird densities were highest (P = 0.037) in the
   second growing season following WSI and fire and lowest in the control,

   Densities of ground/shrub-foraging and shrub-nesting species increased
   (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) the most following WSI and fire.
   Only ground-nesting species were more abundant (P < 0.001) in untreated

Abstract = {{Land use, climate change, and their interaction each have great
   potential to affect grazing systems. With anticipated more frequent and
   extensive future drought, a more complete understanding of the
   mechanisms that determine large grazer landscape-level distribution
   under varying climatic conditions is integral to ecosystem management.
   Using an experimental setting with contrasting fire treatments, we
   describe the inter-annual variability of the effect of landscape
   topography and disturbance from prescribed spring fire on large grazer
   space use in years of variable resource availability. Using GPS
   telemetry, we investigated space use of plains bison (Bison bison bison)
   as they moved among watersheds managed with variable experimental burn
   treatments (1-, 2-, 4-, and 20-year burn intervals) during a seven-year
   period spanning years of average-to-above average forage production and
   severe drought. At the landscape scale, bison more strongly favored
   high-elevation and recently burned watersheds with watersheds burned for
   the first time in 2 or 4 yr consistently showing higher use relative to
   annually burned watersheds. In particular, watersheds burned for the
   first time in 4 yr were avoided to lesser extent than other more
   frequently burned watersheds during the dormant season. This management
   type also maintained coupling between bison space use and post-fire
   regrowth across post-drought growing season months, whereas watersheds
   with more frequent fire-return intervals attracted bison in only the
   first month post-fire. Hence, fire frequency played a role in
   maintaining the coupling of grazer and post-fire regrowth, the
   fire-grazer interaction, in response to drought-induced reduction in
   fuel loads. Moreover, bison avoided upland habitat in poor forage
   production years, when forage regrowth is less likely to occur in upland
   than in lowland habitats. Such quantified responses of bison to
   landscape features can aid future conservation management efforts and
   planning to sustain fire-grazer interactions and resulting spatial
   heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionIn temperate grasslands and savannas that were historically

   promote community resistance to winter climate change by favouring
   slow-growing, resource-conservative species that may also be more
   cold-tolerant. The lack of functional trait data for measuring cold
   tolerance, however, has prevented testing this idea. We ask, are slower
   growing, resource-conservative species more cold-tolerant than
   fast-growing species, and are plant responses to fire frequency and cold
   tolerance related?
   LocationPrairies and savannas of south-central Wisconsin, USA.
   MethodsWe measured leaf cold tolerance for 120 plant species from
   prairies and savannas and compared cold tolerance to fire affinity as
   well as other functional traits describing plant strategies.
   ResultsAs predicted, resource-conservative species are more
   cold-tolerant than fast-growing species in temperate grasslands and

   that species found in frequently burned sites are more cold-tolerant.
   ConclusionsThe ability to predict the degree of susceptibility of

Abstract = {{Restoring the natural or historical state of ecosystems is a common
   objective among resource managers, but determining whether desired
   system responses tomanagement actions are occurring is often protracted
   and challenging. For wildlife, the integration of mechanistic habitat
   modeling with population monitoring may provide expedited measures of
   management effectiveness and improve understanding of how management
   actions succeed or fail to recover populations. Southern Appalachia is a
   region of high biodiversity that has undergone dramatic change as a
   result of human activities such as historic logging, exotic invasions,
   and alteration of disturbance regimes-including reduction in application
   of fire. Contemporary efforts to restore fire-maintained ecosystems
   within southern Appalachian forests require tools to assess the effects
   of fire management practices on individual animal fitness and relate
   them to corresponding influences on species abundance. Using automated
   sensing equipment, we investigated the effects of burned forests on
   reptile habitat suitability within the western portion of Great Smoky
   Mountains National Park, Tennessee. Specifically, we used microclimate
   measurements to model northern fence lizard Sceloporus undulatus
   hyacinthinus diurnal activity budgets in unburned and variable burn age
   (327-y) forest stands. We estimated northern fence lizard occurrence and
   abundance along transects through burned and unburned forests. Burned
   forest stands had microclimates that resulted in longer modeled daily
   activity periods under most conditions during summer. S. undulatus
   abundance was 4.75 times greater on burned stands compared to paired
   unburned stands, although the relationship between burn age and

Abstract = {{Altered fire regimes are a driver of biodiversity decline. To plan
   effective management, we need to know how species are influenced by fire
   and to develop theory describing fire responses. Animal responses to
   fire are usually measured using methods that rely on animal activity,
   but animal activity may vary with time since fire, potentially biasing
   results. Using a novel approach for detecting bias in the pit-fall trap
   method, we found that leaf-litter dependent reptiles were more active up
   to 6 weeks after fire, giving a misleading impression of abundance. This
   effect was not discovered when modelling detectability with
   zero-inflated binomial models. Two species without detection bias showed
   early-successional responses to time since fire, consistent with a
   habitat-accommodation succession model. However, a habitat specialist
   did not have the predicted low abundance after fire due to increased
   post-fire movement and non-linear recovery of a key habitat component.
   Interactions between fire and other processes therefore must be better
   understood to predict reptile responses to changing fire-regimes. We
   conclude that there is substantial bias when trapping reptiles after
   fire, with species that are otherwise hard to detect appearing to be
   abundant. Studies that use a survey method based on animal activity such
   as bird calls or animal movements, likely face a similar risk of bias

Abstract = {{Hybrid cattails (Typha x glauca) are an invasive, emergent aquatic plant
   that often form monodominant stands, which can alter wetland vegetation
   structure and negatively affect wildlife populations. Wetland managers
   often apply prescribed burning, grazing, and herbicide treatments to
   reduce cattail density but how these management actions influence
   wetland wildlife is largely unknown. Our objectives were to investigate
   the effect of hybrid cattail control methods on secretive marsh bird and
   wetland passerine abundance in central Minnesota, USA. Specifically, we
   assessed how environmental variables and cattail treatments (e.g.,
   burning, grazing, and herbicide) influenced bird densities and community
   composition. We used the North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol
   to assess wetland bird communities across sixteen wetlands comprised of
   eight treatments with a full-factorial design. Species-specific density
   estimates and community-wide ordination offered little evidence for a
   substantial effect of treatments on marsh birds and passerines. However,
   gradients in vegetation height and mean biomass did have a significant
   relationship with both passerine and marsh bird community composition,
   which suggests changes in the bird community following cattail
   management might require time to develop. To support diverse wetland
   bird communities, treatments must create contrast among wetland habitats
   with high and low vegetative biomass. Because secretive marsh birds are

Abstract = {{The increased frequency and severity of large wildfires in the western
   United States is an important ecological and management issue with
   direct relevance to amphibian conservation. Although the knowledge of
   fire effects on amphibians in the region is still limited relative to
   most other vertebrate species, we reviewed the current literature to
   determine if there are evident patterns that might be informative for
   conservation or management strategies. Of the seven studies that
   compared pre- and post-wildfire data on a variety of metrics, ranging
   from amphibian occupancy to body condition, two reported positive
   responses and five detected negative responses by at least one species.
   Another seven studies used a retrospective approach to compare effects
   of wildfire on populations: two studies reported positive effects, three
   reported negative effects from wildfire, and two reported no effects.
   All four studies that included plethodontid salamanders reported
   negative effects on populations or individuals; these effects were
   greater in forests where fire had been suppressed and in areas that
   burned with high severity. Species that breed in streams are also
   vulnerable to post-wildfire changes in habitat, especially in the
   Southwest. Wildfire is also important for maintaining suitable habitat
   for diverse amphibian communities, although those results may not be
   evident immediately after an area burns. We expect that wildfire will
   extirpate few healthy amphibian populations, but it is still unclear how
   populations will respond to wildfire in the context of land management
   (including pre-and post-fire timber harvest) and fragmentation. Wildfire
   may also increase the risk of decline or extirpation for small,
   isolated, or stressed (e.g., from drought or disease) populations.
   Improved understanding of how these effects vary according to changes in
   fire frequency and severity are critical to form more effective
   conservation strategies for amphibians in the western United States.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires can be the most influential phenomena in landscape dynamics

   the intentional burning of habitats is still a controversial management
   practice and is legally prohibited in many countries. On the other hand,
   fires can positively control, or even slow down vegetation succession of
   reeds and bushes, and, in particular cases, may sustain a habitat for
   open marsh nesting specialists. One such species is the Aquatic Warbler
   Acrocephalus paludicola, a globally threatened habitat specialist that
   breeds in open fens in Central and Eastern Europe. Because bush and reed
   encroachment threaten many suitable breeding areas, habitat management
   is necessary to maintain the open wetlands that Aquatic Warblers require
   for nesting. To assess whether burning was beneficial, we analysed
   Aquatic Warbler numbers and distribution in the Chelm calcareous marshes

   accidental fires. Our study showed that numbers of warblers, at least of

Abstract = {{Context Reconstructing historical habitat could help reverse declining
   animal populations, but detailed, spatially comprehensive data are rare.
   For example, habitat for the federally threatened Northern spotted owl
   (NSO; Strix occidentalis caurina) was thought historically rare because
   low-severity fires kept forests open and habitat restricted to fire
   refugia, but spatial historical data are lacking.
   Objectives Here I use public land-surveys to spatially reconstruct NSO
   habitat and old-growth forests in dry forests in Oregon's Eastern
   Cascades in the late-1800s. I used reconstructions of forest structure
   across about 280,000 ha, including 9,605 tree records and 2,180
   section-line descriptions. I was able to reconstruct likely NSO nest
   trees, nest stands, and foraging and roosting habitat, based on modern
   NSO habitat studies.
   Results Historical nest stands, including sufficient nest trees, were
   predicted across 22-39 \% and foraging and roosting habitat across 11-68
   \% of the study area, thus neither were rare. More habitat than expected
   occurred in forests with preceding mixed-severity fires. Early post-fire
   succession produced foraging and roosting habitat. Mid-to
   late-succession produced nesting habitat. Late-succession after
   high-severity fires can also provide NSO habitat. Old-growth forests,
   covering 76 \% of study-area forests, also likely link to preceding
   mixed-severity fires.
   Conclusions Mixed-and high-severity fires strongly shaped historical dry
   forests and produced important components of historical NSO habitat.
   Focus on short-term loss of nest sites and territories to these fires is
   mis-directed. Fuel treatments to reduce these natural fires, if
   successful, would reduce future habitat of the NSO in dry forests.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous disturbance patterns are fundamental to rangeland
   conservation and management because heterogeneity creates patchy
   vegetation, broadens niche availability, increases compositional
   dissimilarity, and enhances temporal stability of aboveground biomass
   production. Pyrodiversity is a popular concept for how variability in
   fire as an ecological disturbance can enhance heterogeneity, but
   mechanistic understanding of factors that drive heterogeneity is
   lacking. Mesic grasslands are examples of ecosystems in which
   pyrodiversity is linked strongly to broad ecological processes such as
   trophic interactions because grazers are attracted to recently burned
   areas, creating a unique ecological disturbance referred to as the
   fire-grazing interaction, or pyric herbivory. But several questions
   about the application of pyric herbivory remain: What proportion of a
   grazed landscape must burn, or how many patches are required, to create
   sufficient spatial heterogeneity and reduce temporal variability? How
   frequently should patches burn? Does season of fire matter? To bring
   theory into applied practice, we studied a gradient of grazed tallgrass
   prairie landscapes created by different sizes, seasons, and frequencies
   of fire, and used analyses sensitive to nonlinear trends. The greatest
   spatial heterogeneity and lowest temporal variability in aboveground
   plant biomass, and greatest plant functional group beta diversity,
   occurred in landscapes with three to four patches (25\%-33\% of area
   burned) and three- to four-year fire return intervals. Beta diversity
   had a positive association with spatial heterogeneity and negative
   relationship with temporal variability. Rather than prescribing that
   these results constitute best management practices, we emphasize the
   flexibility offered by interactions between patch number and fire
   frequency for matching rangeland productivity and offtake to specific
   management goals. As we observed no differences across season of fire,
   we recommend future research focus on fire frequency within a moderate
   proportion of the landscape burned, and consider a wider seasonal burn
   window.}},

Abstract = {{The longleaf pine (Pines palustris) ecosystem is one of the most
   endangered ecosystems in the United States. Recent incentives have led
   to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration
   efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there
   have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on
   breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we
   studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with
   either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects
   of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine
   reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ
   (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was
   high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover.
   However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray cat-birds (Dumetella
   carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed
   cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis)
   were more abundant (Pless than or equal to0.10) in areas with native
   groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more
   abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although
   groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall
   avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be
   unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for
   aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management
   using prescribed fire.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus nigra subsp. salzmannii is a pine species that regenerates quite
   well under its own canopy but has difficulty regenerating after fire.
   This study analyzes, by means of greenhouse and field experiments, the
   pattern of seed germination and seedling establishment of P. nigra in a
   gradient of post-fire environmental conditions. The results obtained in
   the controlled conditions experiment of cover effects in the absence of
   vegetation interference indicate that seed germination and seedling
   survival and growth of P. nigra attained their maximum values under high
   cover levels. In the field, seed germination and seedling survival of P.
   nigra were considerably lower than in the experiment outdoors but also
   followed to a large extent the cover gradient. However, there were
   differences among microhabitats depending on the type of vegetation
   present. In general, the behaviour of P. nigra is more similar to that
   of shade-tolerant species, such as oaks, than to low-altitude
   Mediterranean pines, because the establishment of P. nigra seedlings is
   improved under high cover conditions. As these conditions are usually
   lacking in recently burned areas, the regeneration of this species is
   strongly limited after fire. The difficulty in recovering after fire of
   P. nigra forests confirms that they require specific conservation
   measures to prevent their disappearance in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{As grassland ecosystems transform globally due to anthropogenic
   pressures, improvements in our understanding of the effect of management
   on rare and threatened species in such landscapes has become urgent.
   Although prescribed fire is a very efficient tool for habitat
   restoration and endangered species management on fire-adapted
   ecosystems, the specific mechanisms underlying potential effects of
   burning on population dynamics of butterfly host plants are poorly
   understood. We analyzed a 12-year dataset (2004-2015), combining violet
   abundance, habitat physiognomy and fire history data from a fire-managed
   system, to determine factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution
   and abundance of violets (Viola spp.), the host plants of the threatened

   demonstrate a critical role for fire in driving both presence and
   abundance of violets, suggesting management with prescribed fires can
   effectively promote butterfly host plants. In addition, we determined
   the character of habitats associated with violet presence and abundance,
   in particular a strong positive association with biocrusts. These
   results provide a roadmap for efficient site selection to increase the
   effectiveness of restoration efforts, including assessment of potential

Abstract = {{Monitoring and evaluating changes of the various characteristics of
   ecosystems after disturbances are essential to protect the services
   provided by each ecosystem. In the present study, different ecological
   characteristics including structure, composition and diversity at
   different post-fire times (one, five and ten years) in low and high fire
   severities were investigated in semi-arid oak (Quercus brantii L.)
   forests of western Iran. One hundred twenty-six 1.5 x 1.5 m plots were
   sampled in 14 patches (12 burned and 2 unburned). Alpha and beta
   diversity indices as well as species abundance distribution models of
   ecological niche apportionment were produced. The results showed that
   the distribution pattern of species, composition and diversity were
   influenced by the severity and time since fire. Based on Tokeshi's niche
   apportionment models, the low severity and short post-fire time
   generated a pattern with higher heterogeneity (MacArthur fraction; MF)
   than high severity and short post-fire time (dominance decay; DD). In
   contrast, long-term effects were less pronounced. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed that there are different patterns
   of vegetation composition in low and high fire severities. The plant
   composition of the studied areas at low severity but with a longer time
   period since fire was more similar to the control area. In contrast, in
   the high fire severity, unburned and burned plots with different times
   since fire did not occupy overlapping areas in the ordination space.
   Severe fires also increased the alpha diversity at all spatial scales
   whereas the beta diversity only increased at the largest scale. Change
   of plant diversity pattern with time was more homogenous in low fire
   severity and more patchy in high fire severity. We concluded that the
   changes in the structure, composition and diversity of the post-fire
   vegetation were influenced both by fire severity and time since fire and
   that restoration actions to promote vegetation recovery should be
   adapted accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent
   feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer
   support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a
   significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as
   a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly
   understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the
   affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During
   September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18\% population
   mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National
   Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns
   of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population
   physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress)
   levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth
   rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response
   post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement
   with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more
   time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds.
   Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into
   non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement
   rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and
   formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased
   significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels
   did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile
   age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure.
   Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5\% p.a., and
   at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous
   level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen
   in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts,
   follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free
   large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire
   therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental
   catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population
   limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during ``hot-fire''
   conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e.
   removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population
   regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for
   conservation areas.}},

Abstract = {{Native mammals across northern Australia have suffered severe decline,
   with feral cats (Felis catus), introduced herbivores and changed fire
   regimes being implicated as drivers. However, uncertainty surrounding
   the relative contribution of each of these threats, and the interactions
   between them, is limiting the development of effective management
   strategies. The absence of introduced herbivores and cane toads
   (Rhinella marina) on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, provides an
   opportunity to evaluate some hypothesised threats in isolation of
   others. We used camera traps to investigate the correlates of native
   mammal distribution and abundance at 112 lowland savanna sites across
   Groote Eylandt. Two large grids of camera traps were also deployed to
   obtain estimates of feral cat density. We hypothesised that native
   mammal populations would be negatively associated with feral cat
   occupancy as well as frequent, large fires. Native mammal site-occupancy
   on Groote Eylandt was generally higher compared to mainland Northern
   Territory. Feral cats were infrequently detected, precluding both an
   estimate of feral cat density and an evaluation of the relationship
   between feral cats and native mammals. We found no evidence that native
   mammal site-occupancy or relative abundance is negatively associated
   with frequent, large fires. The relatively healthy state of native
   mammal populations on Groote Eylandt is likely due to the low density of
   feral cats, the benign fire regime and the absence of large introduced
   herbivores and cane toads. However, due to a lack of historical data,
   the current state of mammals should not be taken as evidence that these
   populations are safe from decline. This study highlights that the
   apparent resilience of mammal populations is a result of complex
   interactions between factors that vary substantially across the
   landscape. Caution is therefore required when making broad inferences
   about the drivers of mammal decline from studies that are spatially and
   temporally limited.}},

Abstract = {{Woody plant encroachment into open grasslands occurs worldwide and
   causes multiple ecological and management impacts. Prescribed fire could
   be used to conserve grassland habitat but often has limited efficacy
   because many woody plants resprout after fire and rapidly reestablish
   abundance. If fire-induced mortality could be increased, prescribed fire
   would be a more effective management tool. In California's central
   coast, shrub encroachment, especially of Baccharis pilularis (coyote
   brush), is converting coastal prairie into shrub-dominated communities,
   with a consequent loss of native herbaceous species and open grassland
   habitat. B. pilularis has not been successfully controlled with single
   prescribed fire events because the shrub resprouts and reestablishes
   cover within a few years. We investigated whether two consecutive annual
   burns would control B. pilularis by killing resprouting shrubs, without
   reducing native herbaceous species or encouraging invasive plants. As
   expected, resprouting did occur; however, 2 years after the second burn,
   B. pilularis cover on burned plots was only 41\% of the cover on
   unburned plots. Mortality of B. pilularis more than doubled following
   the second burn, likely maintaining a reduction in B. pilularis cover
   for longer than a single burn would have. Three native coastal prairie
   perennial grasses did not appear to be adversely affected by the two
   burns, nor did the burns result in increased cover of invasive species.
   Managers wanting to restore coastal prairie following B. pilularis
   encroachment should consider two consecutive annual burns, especially if
   moderate fire intensity is achievable.}},

   Altered Microsite Conditions}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High severity stand-replacing wildfires can deeply affect forest
   ecosystems whose composition includes plant species lacking fire-related
   traits and specific adaptations. Land managers and policymakers need to
   be aware of the importance of properly managing these ecosystems,
   adopting post-disturbance interventions designed to reach management
   goals, and restoring the required ecosystem services. Recent research
   frequently found that post-fire salvage logging negatively affects
   natural regeneration dynamics, thereby altering successional pathways
   due to a detrimental interaction with the preceding disturbance. In this
   study, we compared the effects of salvage logging and other
   post-disturbance interventions (adopting different deadwood management
   strategies) to test their impact on microclimatic conditions, which
   potentially affect tree regeneration establishment and survival. After
   one of the largest and most severe wildfires in the Western Alps that
   affected stand-replacing behavior (100\% tree mortality), a mountain
   forest dominated by Pinus sylvestris L., three post-fire interventions
   were adopted (SL-Salvage Logging, logging of all snags; CR-Cut and
   Release, cutting snags and releasing all deadwood on the ground; NI-No
   Intervention, all snags left standing). The differences among
   interventions concerning microclimatic conditions (albedo, surface
   roughness, solar radiation, soil moisture, soil temperature) were
   analyzed at different spatial scales (site, microsite). The management
   interventions influenced the presence and density of safe sites for
   regeneration. Salvage logging contributed to the harsh post-fire
   microsite environment by increasing soil temperature and reducing soil
   moisture. The presence of deadwood, instead, played a facilitative role
   in ameliorating microclimatic conditions for seedlings. The CR
   intervention had the highest soil moisture and the lowest soil
   temperature, which could be crucial for seedling survival in the first
   post-fire years. Due to its negative impact on microclimatic conditions
   affecting the availability of preferential microsites for regeneration
   recruitment, salvage logging should not be considered as the only
   intervention to be applied in post-fire environments. In the absence of
   threats or hazards requiring specific management actions (e.g., public
   safety, physical hazards for facilities), in the investigated
   ecosystems, no intervention, leaving all deadwood on site, could result
   in better microclimatic conditions for seedling establishment. A
   preferred strategy to speed-up natural processes and further increase
   safe sites for regeneration could be felling standing dead trees whilst
   releasing deadwood (at least partially) on the ground.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is increasing drought and fire activity in many
   fire-prone regions including the western USA and circumpolar boreal
   forest. These changes highlight the need for improved understanding of
   how multiple disturbances impact trees in these regions. Recent studies
   linking fire behaviour to plant ecophysiology have improved
   understanding of how fire affects tree function and mortality but have
   not investigated interactions between drought stress and fire. In this
   study, Larix occidentalis saplings were subjected to different levels of
   water stress followed by low-intensity surface fires in a controlled
   laboratory setting. Post-fire mortality, recovery and growth were
   monitored for up to 1 year post fire. Generally, increased pre-fire
   water stress resulted in decreased post-fire stem diameter (up to 5\%
   lower) and height (up to 19\% lower) growth. However, severely
   water-stressed saplings whose foliage had senesced before the fires had
   lower 1-year mortality (14\%) and significantly greater post-fire bud
   densities than moderately stressed saplings that did not senesce (86\%
   mortality). The mortality patterns suggest that water-stressed western
   larch saplings exposed to low-intensity wildfires, or prescribed fires
   conducted as part of forest management activities, may exhibit lower
   mortality rates if stress-induced foliar senescence has occurred.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has suggested that prescribed fire will become more
   necessary in the northern Great Plains of the United States as woody
   encroachment and invasive plant species cover increase. Prescribed fire
   will likely become a more frequent management strategy to mimic natural
   processes in grasslands-a combination of fire and grazing. However, the
   amount of research on fire is somewhat lacking since the 1980s, with few
   land managers and producers willing or able to use fire in the western
   half of the northern Great Plains. We evaluated the impact of a wildfire
   in northwest South Dakota on two ecological sites (sandy and shallow
   sandy) and two vegetation types (native rangelands and crested
   wheatgrass pasture lands) to gain more insights into potential fire
   effects by comparing burned with adjacent nonburned sites, as well as
   comparing sites 5 yr prefire and 4 and 16 mo post fire. We collected
   data on plant species composition, bare ground, and biomass production.
   We did not detect any negative effects to the overall plant community,
   but crested wheatgrass did increase on some burned sites 16 mo post
   fire. The most prominent difference between burned and nonburned sites
   was the increase in bare ground and reduced basal litter on burned
   sites, but these changes were undetectable 16 mo after fire. Our results
   suggest mixed-grass prairies in the northern Great Plains are resilient
   to fire, and prescribed fire could be an appropriate management strategy
   when applied at the correct spatial-temporal scale and fire
   prescription. When specific management strategies, like fire, are
   perceived as negative, research has the potential to overcome perception
   and provide more context for land managers and producers on the
   conditions that affect management strategies. (C) 2019 The Society for

Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Exclusion of natural surface fires in warm/dry mixed-conifer forests of
   the western U.S. has increased potential for stand-replacing crown fires
   and reduced resilience of these systems to other disturbances, such as
   drought and insect attack. Tree thinning and the application of
   prescribed fire are commonly used to restore more resilient ecological
   conditions, but currently, there is a lack of long-term data with which
   to evaluate restoration treatment effectiveness in forest types where
   resprouting shrubs dominate understory communities. At a mixed-conifer
   site in southwestern Colorado, we compared forest structure and
   understory vegetation responses to three restoration treatments
   (thin/burn, burn, and control) over 10 years in a completely randomized
   and replicated experiment. Forest density, canopy cover, and crown fuel
   loads were consistently lower, and crown base height was higher, in
   thin/burn than burn or controls, but the effects diminished over time.
   Ten years following treatment, >99\% of all plant species within both
   treatments and the control were native in origin. There were no
   differences between treatments in understory richness, diversity, cover,
   or surface fuels, but graminoid cover more than doubled in all
   treatments over the 15-year monitoring period. Similarly, there was more
   than a 250\% increase post-treatment in shrub density, with the greatest
   increases in the thin/burn treatment. In addition, we saw an increase in
   the average shrub height for both treatments and the control, with shrub
   stems >80 cm becoming the dominant size class in the thin/burn
   treatment. Conifer seedling density was significantly lower in thin/burn
   compared with burn and control treatments after 10 years. Taken
   together, these conditions create challenges for managers aiming to
   reestablish natural fire patterns and sustain mixed-conifer forests. To
   limit the dominance of resprouting shrubs and facilitate conifer
   regeneration after overstory thinning and prescribed fire, managers may
   need to consider new or more intensive approaches to forest restoration,
   particularly given current and projected climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic alteration of fire regimes is implicated in the extinction
   or decline of species across the globe. Active management of fire
   regimes using specified guidelines can help sustain diversity and
   counter this loss. However, some species occur across multiple
   communities with differing fireregime requirements or may exploit the
   dynamics of associated ecotones. These complexities are not easily
   understood via a simple consideration of lifehistory traits or
   unravelled by a simple experimental framework. Population modelling,
   however, may provide valuable insights in these instances, but to date
   this remains unexplored. A population model based on detailed
   demographic, habitat and fireregime data was developed for the species
   Prostanthera askania. The species occurs across rainforest/eucalypt
   forest ecotones subject to long-term alteration, fragmentation and
   invasion by exotic species. Modelling revealed that current recommended
   fire guidelines will not sustain this species under these novel
   conditions. Fire regimes that minimised extinction risk in some
   scenarios had double or five times the fire frequencies of recommended
   regimes. Managing fire was also more important in specific habitat
   (gully habitat rather than on slopes or ridges). Currently applied
   management actions for Prostanthera askania do not include any fire
   management and the regimes that apply to most habitat in which the
   species occurs (no fire or fire at up to 50-year intervals in gully
   habitat) is not optimal for the species. Management will be
   substantially more effective if specific fire treatments revealed by
   this study are employed (e.g. fire intervals of 20-30years in gully
   habitat). The study demonstrates that a conceptualisation and
   consideration of communities as both temporally and spatially dynamic
   can substantially contribute to better fire management outcomes. The
   approach used herein can be readily adapted and applied to a plethora of
   species via a range of software packages and codes.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Although fire is a major form of natural disturbance worldwide, both
   fire-derived landscape context effects and the impacts of fire severity
   are poorly known for many species. To address this knowledge gap, we
   quantified the response of Australian arboreal marsupials to: (1) the
   spatial effects of fire, (2) fire severity, and (3) fire impacts on the
   availability of critical nesting resources - hollow-bearing trees.
   We identified substantial differences among species in response to fire
   severity and landscape-scale fire. The Sugar Glider (Petaurus breviceps)
   and the endangered Leadbeater's Possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) were
   extremely rare on burned sites irrespective of fire severity. In
   addition, these two species declined with the amount of burned forest in
   the surrounding landscape even when their habitat remained unburnt. The
   Mountain Brushtail Possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) and the Greater
   Glider (Petauroides volans) both occurred on burned and unburned sites.
   The Greater Glider responded negatively to fire severity at the site
   level and also negatively to the amount of forest burned in the
   surrounding landscape. The abundance of the Mountain Brushtail Possum
   was lowest on sites subject to moderate severity fire.
   On unburned sites, the presence and abundance of virtually all species
   was characterised by a common positive response to the availability of
   nesting resources in hollow-bearing trees.
   Our findings underscore the importance of management practices to better
   protect species that decline after fire. These include conserving areas
   of unburned forest, particularly those with hollow-bearing trees which
   are critical nest sites for arboreal marsupials. These recommendations
   are currently the opposite of existing management practices. (C) 2013

Title = {{Adult bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat selection in a longleaf pine savanna}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pine savannas are primarily managed with frequent prescribed
   fire (<= 3 years) to promote diversity of flora and fauna, and to
   maintain open, park-like conditions needed by species such as the
   endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). However, a
   knowledge gap exists in our understanding of bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat
   selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct
   our future management decisions.
   Methods: We examined bobcat habitat selection in a pine savanna managed
   with frequent fires at two spatial scales (i.e., study area boundary
   {[}hereafter, landscape scale]) and annual area of use {[}95\% kernel
   density; local scale]), and assessed effects of prescribed fire on
   bobcat habitat selection. Specifically, we monitored 45 bobcats (16
   males and 29 females) during 2001-2007.
   Results: We found differential habitat selection by sex. At the
   landscape scale, female bobcats were closer to mixed pine-hardwoods,
   young pine, and secondary roads, but farther from mature pine and
   hardwoods stands relative to males. We found no difference in selection
   of agriculture, shrub-scrub, and primary roads between sexes. At the
   annual area of use scale, female bobcats were closer to secondary roads,
   but farther from agriculture and shrub-scrub relative to males. We found
   no difference in selection of mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods,
   hardwoods, young pine, and primary roads between sexes. Bobcats
   primarily selected for stands burned <= 1.1 years post-fire.
   Conclusions: Our results show that bobcats exploit a broad range of
   habitat types in pine landscapes managed with frequent fire and commonly
   use recently burned stands (<= 1.1 year post-fire), suggesting prey in
   many areas of this system are at risk of bobcat predation. Additionally,
   we suggest land managers consider scale of selection by bobcats when
   developing habitat management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Open canopy conditions in southeastern pine (Pinus spp.) forests were
   historically maintained by frequent fire and other disturbances, without
   which midstory hardwoods create closed canopy conditions limiting value
   of pine stands for many endemic, disturbance-adapted species.
   Intensively managed pine forests, which comprise 19\% of forests in the
   southeastern U.S., can emulate historical open pine conditions,
   providing appropriate vegetation structure and composition for many
   endemic species. However, exact mechanisms for producing and maintaining
   open pine conditions and subsequent effects on biodiversity have not
   been examined across regions and stand ages. To better inform managers
   about options for providing open pine conditions in intensively managed
   pine stands, we used meta-analyses to examine biodiversity and open pine
   focal species responses to 5 stand establishment intensities and 4
   midrotation practices (prescribed fire, selective herbicide, fire and
   herbicide combination, and thinning). We calculated 1742 biodiversity
   and 169 open pine focal species effect sizes from 42 publications of
   manipulative studies at 14 unique study sites in managed loblolly pine
   (P. taeda L.) forests in the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains of the
   southeastern U.S. We quantified diversity and abundance responses by
   taxa and management practices for vegetation, birds, amphibians,
   reptiles, small mammals, and invertebrates. Diversity and abundance
   responses generally decreased as stand establishment intensity
   increased, but those reductions appeared to be short-term (<3 years).
   Birds and open pine focal species responded positively to chemical stand
   establishment relative to a mechanically-prepared control. Thinning
   elicited positive diversity and abundance responses from reptiles and
   small mammals. Effects of prescribed fire, selective herbicide, and
   their combination on biodiversity responses varied by taxa (e.g.,
   following fire, vegetative and avian diversity increased but amphibian
   and invertebrate diversity decreased). Further research is warranted on
   under-represented taxa (e.g., herpetofauna and invertebrates) in
   literature and long-term effects of forest management on biodiversity.
   Understanding how silvicultural management practices produce and
   maintain open pine forest conditions and influence biodiversity
   responses is necessary to inform opportunities for open-pine wildlife

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is frequently advocated as a means of managing

   planning prescribed burns in the southern forests of Western Australia.
   We examined (i) the recolonisation of burnt areas; (ii) the refuge value

   to guide fire planning to achieve desired habitat management outcomes.
   We hypothesised that fire regimes promoting vegetation structure and
   patchiness of burnt and unburnt vegetation would result in more rapid
   recolonisation of burnt areas by quokkas. Occupancy modelling identified
   the most important variables for recolonisation as retention of vertical
   vegetation structure and multiple unburnt patches across >20\% of the
   total area. These outcomes were associated with high surface moisture,
   low soil dryness and slow fire rates of spread. Intense wildfire
   resulted in complete loss of vegetation structure and a lack of unburnt
   patches, which contributed to these areas remaining uncolonised. Burning
   with high moisture differentials, maximising the effectiveness of
   edaphic barriers to fire, retaining unburnt vegetation and maintaining

Abstract = {{Threatened organisms may act as host to a suite of dependent organisms,

   its host-specific herbivorous plant-louse Trioza barrettae Taylor \&
   Moir, to establish whether conservation actions should be implemented
   jointly for both species. We also examine the role of host population
   size and fire history on the density of psyllids on host plants. We show
   that the patterns of mtDNA variation in T. barrettae and microsatellite
   variation in both species support the presence of at least two
   conservation units across each species, with the microsatellites also
   showing a high evolutionary congruency between plant and insect

   the importance of considering patterns of genetic diversity of source
   material from both host and dependent organisms for ex situ

   management on rangelands require improved understanding of fire effects
   on runoff and erosion from steeply sloping sagebrush-steppe. Small (0-5
   m(2)) and large (32.5 m(2)) plot rainfall simulations (85 mm h(-1), I h)
   and concentrated flow methodologies were employed immediately following
   burning and I and 2 years post-fire to investigate infiltration, runoff
   and erosion from interrill (rainsplash, sheetwash) and rill
   (concentrated flow) processes on unburned and burned areas of a steeply
   sloped sagebrush site on coarse-textured soils. Soil water repellency
   and vegetation were assessed to infer relationships in soil and
   vegetation factors that influence runoff and erosion. Runoff and erosion
   from rainfall simulations and concentrated flow experiments increased
   immediately following burning. Runoff returned to near pre-burn levels
   and sediment yield was greatly reduced with ground cover recovery to 40
   per cent I year post-fire. Erosion remained above pre-burn levels on
   large rainfall simulation and concentrated flow plots until ground cover
   reached 60 per cent two growing seasons post-fire. The greatest impact
   of the fire was the threefold reduction of ground cover. Removal of
   vegetation and ground cover and the influence of pre-existing strong
   soil-water repellency increased the spatial continuity of overland flow,
   reduced runoff and sediment filtering effects of vegetation and ground
   cover, and facilitated increased velocity and transport capacity of
   overland flow. Small plot rainfall simulations suggest ground cover
   recovery to 40 per cent probably protected the site from
   low-return-interval storms, large plot rainfall and concentrated flow
   experiments indicate the site remained susceptible to elevated erosion
   rates during high-intensity or long duration events until ground cover

Abstract = {{We investigated the stand history of whitebark pine forests on 3
   mountains in the Lolo National Forest, Montana, USA to characterize the
   fire regimes and other disturbance agents that historically operated at
   these sites and to explore the potential influences of modern fire
   suppression on these forests. We used historical fire atlas data and
   dendroecological data to reconstruct the distinct history of each stand.
   The fire regimes of each site fit within the general definition of
   mixed-severity fire regimes, but distinct differences in fire frequency
   and severity existed between them. All 3 stands contained at least 1
   post-disturbance cohort and had experienced at least 1 widespread fire
   over their histories. We found no consistent fire-climate relationship
   at these sites. Mountain pine beetles were the primary mortality agent
   in the current stands at all 3 sites. Subalpine fir began establishing
   at each site within 2 decades of the most recent widespread fire and
   well before fire suppression was effective in this region. Fire
   suppression may have reduced the occurrence of fire during the late
   20(th) century at all 3 sites, but only the forest on Point Six has
   exceeded the mean interval between widespread fires. The differences in
   fire activity and effects of fire suppression that we observed at these

Abstract = {{Fire management at the landscape scale may be detrimental to threatened
   species restricted to fire refugia, such as riparian zones, if their
   fire response is assumed based on the broader vegetation community type.
   Conserving threatened plant species in fire-prone habitats requires
   understanding how life-history traits allow persistence under prevailing
   fire regimes. Using three threatened Pomaderris species associated with
   riparian zones in south-east Australia, we tested for evidence of
   fire-adapted traits to identify if key life-history traits are coupled
   to specific fire cues and determine how their current distribution
   relates to prevailing fire regimes. We did this by (i) exposing seeds to
   heat-shock treatments with fire-related temperatures (60-100 degrees C)
   in germination trials; (ii) testing for the presence of a soil-stored
   seed bank and its response to fire by using ex-situ experimental burns
   on soil samples and (iii) conducting field surveys of post-fire
   demographic responses for P. adnata. All species showed maximum
   germination following heat-shock treatment at 100 degrees C, strongly
   suggesting adaptation to high severity fire. Seedling emergence from
   soil samples was positively affected by fire for P. bodalla and P.
   walshii, while there was an in situ post-fire germination pulse in P.
   adnata seedling recruitment and moderate increases in resprouting and
   survivorship of mature plants. The study demonstrates that these
   riparian-occurring species have life-history traits that may enable
   persistence under high severity fire and highlights how the possession
   of bet-hedging strategies may allow species to use riparian zones as
   fire refugia in a landscape dominated by an anthropogenically altered
   fire regime.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between fire and grazing are widespread throughout
   fire-dependent landscapes. The utilization of burned areas by grazing
   animals establishes the fire-grazing interaction, but the preference for
   recently burned areas relative to other influences (water, topography,
   etc.) is unknown. In this study, we determine the strength of the
   fire-grazing interaction by quantifying the influence of fire on
   ungulate site selection. We compare the preference for recently burned
   patches relative to the influence of other environmental factors that
   contribute to site selection; compare that preference between native and
   introduced ungulates; test relationships between area burned and
   herbivore preference; and determine forage quality and quantity as
   mechanisms of site selection. We used two large ungulate species at two
   grassland locations within the southern Great Plains, USA. At each
   location, spatially distinct patches were burned within larger areas
   through time, allowing animals to select among burned and unburned
   areas. Using fine scale ungulate location data, we estimated resource
   selection functions to examine environmental factors in site selection.
   Ungulates preferred recently burned areas and avoided areas with greater
   time since fire, regardless of the size of landscape, herbivore species,
   or proportion of area burned. Forage quality was inversely related to
   time since fire, while forage quantity was positively related. We show
   that fire is an important component of large ungulate behavior with a
   strong influence on site selection that drives the fire-grazing
   interaction. This interaction is an ecosystem process that supersedes
   fire and grazing as separate factors, shaping grassland landscapes.
   Inclusion of the fire-grazing interaction into ecological studies and
   conservation practices of fire-prone systems will aid in better
   understanding and managing these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Historically fire was an important natural disturbance shaping the
   structure and composition of pine-dominated forests in the southern
   United States. Longstanding fire suppression policies have resulted in
   structural and compositional changes, notably accumulation of heavy fuel
   loads and reduction in vegetation species diversity. Primary goals of
   forest management through prescribed burning include fuel load reduction
   and mimicking ecosystem impacts of historically natural wildfires. In
   addition to the influences of fire frequency and season, the influence
   of fire severity on ecosystem responses is currently of interest. In
   this study we sought to quantify the impacts of low, moderate, and high
   severity fires, and their interaction with prior forest management
   practices, to several aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem components of a
   southern U.S. mixed pine/hardwood forest using a before-after,
   control-impact (BACI) approach. The ecosystem components we assessed
   were water quality, community composition of aquatic arthropods
   (wildfire impacts only), forest structure characteristics, community
   composition of understory vegetation, and community composition of
   ground-dwelling arthropods. We found that increasing fire severity
   increased aquatic nutrient levels and productivity, but the magnitude of
   effects increased with severity. Low and moderate severity fires had
   weak effects on forest structure characteristics, community composition
   of understory vegetation, and community composition of ground-dwelling
   arthropods in the initial years following burns. In contrast, high
   severity fires dramatically reduced fine and large fuel loads, increased
   diversity of understory vegetation, and influenced community composition
   of ground-dwelling arthropods. Further, wildfire severity was reduced in
   areas with a prior moderate severity prescribed burn, but not in areas
   with a prior low severity prescribed burn. Our results provide
   quantitative evidence for the role of fire severity as a primary factor
   influencing responses of ecosystems to fire, and indicate that forest
   management practices influence the impact of high severity fires on
   ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the short-term (> 3 years) response of land birds to forest

Abstract = {{Fire is an important disturbance process that regulates forest stand
   structure and species diversity in many ecosystems across the

   management, land clearing, and vegetation maintenance. Fire frequency
   increased during the periods of Native American occupation and early
   European colonization, but it has decreased since Native American
   displacement, colonist farm abandonment, and direct fire suppression,
   causing shifts in plant community composition toward shade-tolerant,

   prescribed fire for restoration, especially in the face of climatic
   change. Salient lessons from history are: (a) fire is natural, (b) fire

Volume = {{400}},
Pages = {{555-567}},

Abstract = {{Research has been undertaken on the hydrological and erosional impact of
   forest fires, but remarkably little work has been conducted on salvage
   logging operations that often follow them. We assessed the effects of
   mechanical salvage logging following wildfire on soil physical
   properties, ground cover, and runoff and erosion response on a eucalypt
   stand in Portugal. We compared two levels of mechanical disturbance,
   skid trails by a wheeled forwarder tractor ({''}skid\_low{''}) and skid
   trails by the same tractor followed by a tracked feller-buncher
   ({''}skid\_high{''}) with control conditions (no mechanical
   disturbance). Three plots (16 m(2)) by level of soil disturbance were
   installed after a moderate intensity fire and subsequent logging
   operations, and monitored during the first post-fire year. In two
   control and two skid\_low plots runoff was also measured.
   Soil bulk density was higher with increasing mechanical disturbance.
   Soil compaction reduced porosity 7-16\%, but as the control porosity was
   70\%, the reduced porosity still was 60-65\%. Soil resistance to
   penetration significantly increased for the most disturbed area, whereas
   soil shear strength was significantly reduced in the intermediate
   disturbance level. Mechanical disturbance did not induce significant
   effects on soil moisture or ground cover. Initial greater coverage by
   bare soil in the disturbed plots compared to the control was compensated
   by a more rapid vegetation recovery in those plots.
   Annual runoff amount was not higher at the skid-low than at control
   plots. Absence of runoff difference was due to high soil porosity of
   65\%, even after tractor trafficking, and a greater surface roughness on
   the skid\_low plots compared to the control. Sediment production
   increased with increasing soil disturbance. The mean sediment rate was
   1.6-3 times greater for the disturbed than the control plots. This
   increase could be explained by the higher soil compaction and reduced
   soil shear strength on the mechanically disturbed plots and initial
   differences in ground cover. Organic matter content of the eroded
   sediments was higher on the control than the disturbed plots, due to
   initial higher ash cover on the control plots.
   Overall, sediment production was significantly related to rainfall
   intensity and reduced by vegetation regrowth. Sediment rates tend to
   decrease with time since the initial fire and logging disturbance,
   highlighting the importance of a rapid implementation of erosion control
   measures. Specific management practices are needed to minimize the
   impacts of logging in burnt soils which are already subject to greater
   erosion risk and soil degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   listed threatened skink?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{207-216}},
Abstract = {{Context. Prescribed burning is widely adopted as a
   conservation-management tool, with priorities largely being the
   protection of fire-sensitive plant communities, threatened fauna habitat
   and minimising the risk and impacts of broad-scale wildfire. However, an
   improved understanding of the ecological mechanisms that underpin
   species responses to fire will assist the development and refinement of
   prescribed-burning practice.
   Aims. To examine the effect of fire on burrow-system occupancy and
   breeding success at different spatial and temporal scales for a
   threatened skink, Liopholis kintorei.
   Methods. Experimental burns simulating different fire types (clean burn,
   patchy burn and no burn) were conducted at 30 L. kintorei burrow systems
   that were selected from within a 75-ha focal study area. Burrow-system
   occupancy was monitored daily for 1 month, then monthly for an
   additional 3 months. Breeding success was assessed once at all 30 burrow
   systems. Eight additional 1-km(2) sites within L. kintorei habitat that
   had experienced some degree of fire 2 years earlier were selected from
   across Newhaven Wildlife Sanctuary. Burrow-system occupancy and breeding
   success of L. kintorei at these sites was assessed once.
   Key results. There was no significant effect of fire on burrow-system
   occupancy 1 month after experimental burns; however, burrow-system
   occupancy was significantly higher at unburnt sites 4 months after
   experimental burns and 2 years post-fire. Breeding success was
   significantly higher at unburnt sites than at clean-burnt and
   patchy-burnt sites.
   Conclusions. Fire adversely affects L. kintorei, as demonstrated by a
   higher proportion of unoccupied burrow systems and fewer successful
   breeding events post-fire, particularly when all ground cover is lost.
   Implications. Because fire is an inevitable and natural process within
   arid-zone spinifex grasslands, the primary habitat for L. kintorei, we
   recommend prescribed-burning practices that aim to maximise ground cover
   by reducing the frequency, intensity and size of fires. More
   specifically, we recommend fire exclusion from key sites within distinct
   localities where L. kintorei is known to be locally abundant. Depending
   on the size of these key sites, there may also be a need to construct
   strategic fire breaks within sites to ensure that any unwanted ignitions
   do not result in the loss of all vegetation cover.}},

Abstract = {{In the Simpson Desert, central Australia, heavy rainfalls associated
   with the La Nina phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during
   1999-2000 stimulated a pulse of primary productivity that prompted a
   rodent irruption during 2001, and subsequently an extensive wildfire in
   2001-2002. More than 10,000 km 2 of spinifex habitat were burned. In
   this study we examine a time series of climatic variables, and small
   mammal and predator dynamics in the desert in 1999-2002; and a
   before-after-control- impact study investigating the effects of the
   wildfire on small mammals. Rodents showed a delayed numerical increase
   in response to rainfall, whereas terrestrial predators showed a delayed
   numerical increase in response to rodent density. These delayed
   responses suggest the existence of bottom-up trophic pathways. However,
   a reduction in primary productivity and increase in predators appeared
   to suppress rodent numbers in 2001-2002, indicating that bottom-up
   effects can be temporarily reversed in this system. Wildfire had
   negative impacts on the abundance of the desert mouse (Pseudomys
   desertor) and the overall richness of small mammal species. Several
   other species of small mammals also appeared to show brief negative
   responses to wildfire. The impacts of wildfire on small mammals appear
   attributable to a loss of habitat for spinifex-dependent species and
   increased exposure to predation in burned habitats. Because extensive
   wildfires can be predicted from patterns of rainfall and fuel
   accumulation, we recommend that land managers be proactive in
   recognizing and reducing conditions of fire hazard. We recommend that
   small-scale prescribed bums should be carried out to reduce the extent
   of wildfires and also increase the chance of maintaining potential
   refuges from predators. In addition, control of introduced predators
   during and after irruptions of rodents will be crucial to prevent
   predator-driven crashes of their populations and those of secondary prey
   species. ENSO-related climatic forecasts appear to be useful cues that
   can be incorporated into fire and predator management strategies in and
   Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fire is often considered a primary threat to California spotted
   owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) because fire has the potential to
   rapidly alter owl habitat. We examined effects of fire on 7 radiomarked
   California spotted owls from 4 territories by quantifying use of habitat
   for nesting, roosting, and foraging according to severity of burn in and
   near a 610-km(2) fire in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, USA, 4
   years after fire. Three nests were located in mixed-conifer forests, 2
   in areas of moderate-severity burn, and one in an area of low-severity
   burn, and one nest was located in an unburned area of
   mixed-conifer-hardwood forest. For roosting during the breeding season,
   spotted owls selected low-severity burned forest and avoided
   moderate-and high-severity burned areas; unburned forest was used in
   proportion with availability. Within 1 km of the center of their
   foraging areas, spotted owls selected all severities of burned forest
   and avoided unburned forest. Beyond 1.5 km, there were no discernable
   differences in use patterns among burn severities. Most owls foraged in
   high-severity burned forest more than in all other burn categories;
   high-severity burned forests had greater basal area of snags and higher
   shrub and herbaceous cover, parameters thought to be associated with
   increased abundance or accessibility of prey. We recommend that burned
   forests within 1.5 km of nests or roosts of California spotted owls not
   be salvage-logged until long-term effects of fire on spotted owls and
   their prey are understood more fully. (JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

Abstract = {{Many land-management agencies are restoring savannas and woodlands using
   prescribed fire and forest thinning, and information is needed on how
   wildlife species respond to these management activities. Our objectives
   were to evaluate support for relationships of bat site occupancy with
   vegetation structure and management and landscape composition and
   structure across a gradient of savanna to forest in the Missouri Ozark
   Highlands, USA. We selected study sites that were actively managed for
   savanna and woodland conditions and control areas on similar landforms
   that had succeeded to closed-canopy forest. We used Anabat detectors to
   survey bats during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012. We fit
   single-species site-occupancy models to estimate detection probability
   and site occupancy. We evaluated a priori hypotheses in an information
   theoretic approach by evaluating support for candidate models that
   included habitat, landscape, and management effects. Site occupancy of
   evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) was negatively related to poletimber
   and sawtimber density and positively related to fire frequency, while
   northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) site occupancy was
   positively related to poletimber density and negatively related to
   understory stem densities. Site occupancy of big brown bats (Eptesicus
   fuscus), eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and tri-colored bats
   (Perimyotis subflavus) were mostly not related to local vegetation
   structure and site occupancy was high across the savanna, woodland,
   forest gradient. We found more consistent and larger effect sizes for
   landscape-scale than for habitat-scale relationships; therefore, land
   managers should be cognizant of large-scale patterns in land cover when
   making local management decisions for these species. Published 2014.

Abstract = {{Where threatened species persist in multiple use landscapes, management
   activities, such as prescribed burning, may influence the availability
   of resources for those species. We examined how time since fire can
   influence food resources for the endangered Carnaby's cockatoo
   (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) in banksia woodlands of southwestern
   Australia. Tree density and cone productivity of dominant plant species,
   Banksia attenuata and Banksia menziesii, were compared across 44 sites
   of varying post-fire aged vegetation. The number of Carnaby's cockatoos
   that could be supported in banksia woodlands was estimated using the
   bird's energetic requirements and seed energy content. Banksia attenuata
   produced more cones at sites aged 10-30 years since fire in both survey
   years, while cone productivity for B. menziesii was highest in very old
   sites (>35 years since fire) in one year only. Higher numbers of
   Carnaby's cockatoos were predicted to be supported in vegetation aged
   between 14-30 years since fire, peaking in vegetation aged 20-25 years.
   The current distribution of post-fire aged vegetation within this area
   (>60\% burnt within the last 7 years) is predicted to support 2725
   Carnaby's cockatoos, representing 25-35\% of the estimated birds reliant
   on the area. Our results indicate that food resources are influenced by
   time since fire and, consequently, if optimising food resources was an
   objective, may be manipulated by altering burning patterns. While human
   and asset protection is a priority for prescribed burning, management of
   landscapes for improved persistence of threatened species is also
   important and complex trade-offs will have to be considered. (C) 2014

Title = {{Predictors of mortality of pediatric burn injury in the Douala General
   Hospital, Cameroon}},
Journal = {{PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{33}},
Month = {{JUL 11}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: burn injuries are a major cause of hospitalization and are
   associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in
   children aged four years or below. In Cameroon, the mortality rate of
   pediatric severe burns was estimated at 41.2\%. There is need to
   determine the predictors of such mortality in order to guide appropriate
   management. Methods: this study is aimed at assessing the predictors of
   mortality of pediatric patients who sustained a burn injury over a
   period of 11 years (between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December
   2016) in Douala General Hospital (DGH). The data for this study was
   entered in an electronic questionnaire and analyzed using Epi info
   version 7. All variables thought to be associated with mortality were
   entered in a multiple binary logistic regression model. The magnitude or
   risk was measured by odds ratio, and the 95\% confidence interval was
   estimated. Results: a total of 125 cases of pediatric burns were
   recorded over the study period. A total of 69 (55.65\%) were males,
   giving a male to female ratio of 1.25:1. The median age was 4 years.
   Most pediatric burns resulted from accidents. Most patient 78 (69\%)
   came before 8 hours following injury. Scalding was the predominant
   mechanism of injury in 56 (45.5\%) of patients. Most patients had
   partial thickness burn and most burns involved 1-9.9\% body surface
   areas (BSA). The mean length of hospital stay in this study was 7 days,
   more than half of the patients had no complications during admission.
   Among those that developed complications, 19 (35\%) developed sepsis.
   Conclusion: mortality rate of pediatric burns obtained in this study was
   29\%, mostly due to cardiac arrest. Flame burns (p=0.03) and BSA >25\%
   (p=0.001) were statistically significant predictors of mortality.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Australia has a highly diverse and variable climate and its forests are
   well-adapted to climatic variation. However, human-induced changes in
   climate could exceed historical ranges of variability and have effects
   on forests well beyond the experience of forest managers. These
   conditions will require implementation of management practices
   appropriate to a changing climate but there has been little analysis of
   potential management options for Australian native forests. The paper
   analyses potential management options for the tall, wet eucalypt forests
   in Victoria's Central Highlands. This region has already experienced a
   strong drying and warming trend and a high incidence of severe bushfires
   over the last 15years. Future changes are likely to include rising CO2,
   increasing temperatures and an overall decrease and changing seasonal
   patterns in rainfall. This is likely to result in higher fire danger
   weather conditions, changes in phenology of flowering, seeding and
   germination and shifts in forest composition and productivity. A range
   of different management options were considered and analysed in terms of
   current practice, costs and implementation feasibility. Many management
   actions identified to support adaptation to climate change were assessed
   as currently being implemented as part of sustainable forest management
   arrangements. Options that are not generally currently implemented
   include developing gene management programs and off-site gene banks,
   ex-situ conservation and increasing cooperation in species management,
   increasing stand and regional species diversity, identification and
   deployment of more drought- or disturbance-tolerant species or
   genotypes, planning to reduce disease losses through monitoring and
   sanitation harvests, managing stand structure to reduce impacts on water
   availability and implementing silvicultural techniques to promote stand
   vigour, as practised elsewhere in Australia. The likelihood of more
   intense rainfall events will require changes to infrastructure, such as
   forest road design and construction specifications. Implementing
   adaptation will require new approaches to forest management, potentially
   involving significant human intervention, new ecological, environmental
   and social research, new modes of communication with the public, new
   policies and revised regulations and management prescriptions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of vegetation structure and fire history
   on the foraging behavior of small rodents (Notomys mitchellii, Pseudomys
   hermannsburgensis, and Mus musculus) by conducting giving-up density
   (GUD) experiments in recently burnt (9-13 years since last fire) and
   long unburnt shrublands (> 40 years), and open and sheltered
   microhabitats, in a semiarid region of Western Australia. We predicted
   that rodents would spend less time foraging in recently burnt shrublands
   and open microhabitat and that the influence of microhabitat would be
   weaker in long unburnt compared to more recently burnt vegetation. Our
   findings show that fire history and microhabitat structure influence the
   foraging behavior of the study species and that the influence of
   microhabitat varies between fire histories. GUDs were higher in long
   unburnt vegetation and in open microhabitats. There was a microhabitat
   effect in recently burnt vegetation, but not in long unburnt. Rodents
   foraged more in sheltered microhabitats probably because predator
   encounters are less likely to occur there and it provides them with
   greater refuge from predation. The presence of a microhabitat effect in
   recently burnt, but not long unburnt vegetation suggests that understory
   vegetation density is more important in mediating predation risk than
   canopy density. Future studies of small mammal responses to land
   management actions should include behavioral, as well as
   population-level responses to differing fire regimes.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Inappropriate fire regimes and predation by introduced species each pose
   a major threat to Australia's native mammals. They also potentially
   interact, an issue that is likely to be contributing to the ongoing
   collapse of native mammal communities across Australia. In the present
   review, I first describe the mechanisms through which fire could create
   predation pinch points, exacerbating the impacts of predators, including
   red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, and feral cats, Felis catus, on their native
   mammalian prey. These mechanisms include a localised increase in
   predator activity (a numerically mediated pathway) and higher predator
   hunting success after fire (a functionally moderated pathway), which
   could both increase native mammal mortality and limit population
   recovery in fire-affected landscapes. Evidence for such interactions is
   growing, although largely based on unreplicated experiments. Improving
   native mammal resilience to fire in predator-invaded landscapes requires
   addressing two key questions: how can the impacts of introduced
   predators on native mammals in fire-affected areas be reduced; and, does
   a reduction in predation by introduced species result in higher native
   mammal survival and population recovery after fire? I then examine
   potential management options for reducing predator impacts post-fire.
   The most feasible are landscape-scale predator control and the
   manipulation of fire regimes to create patchy fire scars. However,
   robust field experiments with adequate statistical power are required to
   assess the effectiveness of these approaches and preclude null (e.g.
   compensatory mortality) or adverse (e.g. mesopredator or competitor
   release) outcomes. Ongoing predator management and prescribed burning
   programs provide an opportunity to learn through replicated natural
   experiments as well as experimental manipulations. Standardised
   reporting protocols and cross-jurisdiction monitoring programs would
   help achieve necessary spatial and environmental replication, while
   multi-trophic, spatially explicit simulation models could help
   synthesise findings from disparate study designs, predict management
   outcomes and generate new hypotheses. Such approaches will be key to
   improving management of the complex mechanisms that drive threatened
   native mammal populations in Australia's predator-invaded, fire-prone
   landscapes.}},

Title = {{Impacts of Land Management on the Resilience of Mediterranean Dry
   Forests to Fire}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Wildfires have always been a part of the history of Mediterranean
   forests. However, forests are not always certain to regenerate after a
   wildfire. Whether they do depends on many factors, some of which may be
   influenced by land management activities. Failure to regenerate will
   cause a regime shift in the ecosystem, reducing the provision of
   ecosystem services and ultimately leading to desertification. How can we
   increase the resilience of Mediterranean forests to fire? Our approach
   to answering this question was twofold: first, we reviewed the
   literature to investigate chains of processes that allowed forests to
   regenerate (which we label Regeneration Mechanisms, or RMs); and second,
   we assessed the impact of selected management practices documented in
   the WOCAT database on these RMs. For the assessment, we evaluated the
   relation between the benefits and disadvantages of the land management
   practices on the one hand, and the hindering and supporting factors of
   the RMs on the other. We identified three distinct RMs that enable
   Mediterranean forests to recover, as well as the time frame before and
   after a fire in which they are at work, and factors that can hinder or
   support resilience. The three RMs enabling a forest to regenerate after
   a fire consist of regeneration (1) from a seed bank; (2) from
   resprouting individuals; and (3) from unburned plants that escaped the
   fire. Management practices were grouped into four categories: (1) fuel
   breaks; (2) fuel management; (3) afforestation; and (4) mulching. We
   assessed how and under what conditions land management modifies the
   ecosystem's resilience. The results show that land management influences
   resilience by interacting with resilience mechanisms before and after
   the fire, and not just by modifying the fire regime. Our analysis
   demonstrates a need for adaptive-i.e., context-and
   time-specific-management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Australia has contributed a disproportionate number of the world's
   mammal extinctions over the past 200years, with the greatest loss of
   species occurring through the continent's southern and central arid
   regions. Many taxonomically and ecologically similar species are now
   undergoing widespread decline across the northern Australian mainland,
   possibly driven by predation by feral cats and changed fire regimes.
   Here, we report marked recent declines of native mammal species in one
   of Australia's few remaining areas that support an intact mammal
   assemblage, Melville Island, the largest island off the northern
   Australian coast. We have previously reported a marked decline on
   Melville Island of the threatened brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus
   penicillatus) over the period 2000-2015, linked to predation by feral
   cats. We now report a 62\% reduction in small mammal trap-success and a
   36\% reduction in site-level species richness over this period. There
   was a decrease in trap-success of 90\% for the northern brown bandicoot
   (Isoodon macrourus), 64\% for the brush-tailed rabbit-rat and 63\% for
   the black-footed tree-rat (Mesembriomys gouldii), but no decline for the
   common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). These results suggest
   that populations of native mammals on Melville Island are exhibiting
   similar patterns of decline to those recorded in Kakadu National Park
   two decades earlier, and across the northern Australian mainland more
   generally. Without the implementation of effective management actions,
   these species are likely to be lost from one of their last remaining
   strongholds, threatening to increase Australia's already
   disproportionate contribution to global mammal extinctions.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding tropical forest diversity is a long-standing challenge in
   ecology. With global change, it has become increasingly important to
   understand how anthropogenic and natural factors interact to determine
   diversity. Anthropogenic increases in fire frequency are among the
   global change variables affecting forest diversity and functioning, and
   seasonally dry forest of the southern Amazon is among the ecosystems
   most affected by such pressures. Studying how fire will impact forests
   in this region is therefore important for understanding ecosystem
   functioning and for designing effective conservation action. We report
   the results of an experiment in which we manipulated fire, nutrient
   availability, and herbivory. We measured the effects of these
   interacting factors on the regenerative capacity of the ecotone between
   humid Amazon forest and Brazilian savanna. Regeneration density,
   diversity, and community composition were severely altered by fire.
   Additions of P and N + P reduced losses of density and richness in the
   first year post-fire. Herbivory was most important just after
   germination. Diversity was positively correlated with herbivory in
   unburned forest, likely because fire reduced the number of reproductive
   individuals. This contrasts with earlier results from the same study
   system in which herbivory was related to increased diversity after fire.
   We documented a significant effect of fire frequency; diversity in
   triennially burned forest was more similar to that in unburned than in
   annually burned forest, and the community composition of triennially
   burned forest was intermediate between unburned and annually burned
   areas. Preventing frequent fires will therefore help reduce losses in
   diversity in the southern Amazon's matrix of human-altered landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands can be diverse assemblages of grasses and forbs but not much
   is known how perennial grass species management affects native plant
   diversity except in a few instances. We studied the use of late-spring
   prescribed burns over a span of 11 years where the perennial grass Poa
   secunda was the foundation species, with four additional years of
   measurements after the final burn. We evaluated burn effects on P.
   secunda, the rare native annual forb Amsinckia grandiflora and local
   native and exotic species. Annual burning maintained P. secunda number,
   resulted in significant expansion, the lowest thatch and exotic grass
   cover, the highest percentage of bare ground, but also the lowest native
   forb and highest exotic forb cover. Burning approximately every 3 years
   maintained a lower number of P. secunda plants, allowed for expansion,
   and resulted in the highest native forb cover with a low exotic grass
   cover. Burning approximately every 5 years and the control (burned once
   from a wildfire) resulted in a decline in P. secunda number, the highest
   exotic grass and thatch cover and the lowest percentage of bare ground.
   P. secunda numbers were maintained up to 4 years after the final burn.
   While local native forbs benefited from burning approximately every 3
   years, planted A. grandiflora performed best in the control treatment.
   A. grandiflora did not occur naturally at the site; therefore, no seed
   bank was present to provide across-year protection from the effects of
   the burns. Thus,perennial grass species management must also consider
   other native species life history and phenology to enhance native flora
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The Samcheok forest fire of April 2000 was the biggest stand-replacing
   fire recorded in Korea, and led to the largest-scale salvage logging
   operation (performed until 2005) ever implemented. We investigated the
   effects of the treatments performed after the fire on the breeding bird
   community in 2002-2005 (the management period) and 2006-2008 (the
   post-management period). A total of 75 line transect surveys resulted in
   660 detections of 54 species in undisturbed stands (CO), in burned and
   naturally restored stands (NI), and in burned and logged stands (IT).
   Four species (Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Dendrocopos kizuki, and
   Parus ater) were identified as indicator species in CO which showed no
   temporal changes in bird communities and habitat structure. Among the
   various stand treatments, the standardized species richness was highest
   in CO (11.6 +/- A 4.6 species/transect in 2002-2005, 12.1 +/- A 3.5 in
   2006-2008), and this richness did not change over time. On the other
   hand, low richness was observed in NI (6.8 +/- A 2.6 in 2002-2005, 9.6
   +/- A 2.3 in 2006-2008), and the lowest richness was seen in IT (5.0 +/-
   A 2.4 in 2002-2005, 6.1 +/- A 1.8 in 2006-2008), but both of these
   increased over time. Although the bird abundances in NI and IT were
   lower than those in CO (38.0 +/- A 27.7 birds/transect in 2002-2005,
   31.3 +/- A 10.9 in 2006-2008), the abundances in NI (15.1 +/- A 8.6 in
   2002-2005, 17.6 +/- A 11.4 in 2006-2008) and IT (11.7 +/- A 8.3 in
   2002-2005, 10.0 +/- A 4.6 in 2006-2008) were not significantly
   different. There was no significant difference in abundance between time
   periods for any of the stand treatments. These results imply that NI
   (i.e., no salvage logging) allows greater bird richness but not
   abundance to be recovered compared to IT. No indicator species was
   consistently present in NI throughout the two time periods covered due
   to the rapid regrowth of vegetation, but four open-habitat dwellers
   (Falco tinnunculus, Phoenicurus auroreus, Emberiza cioides, and Sturnus
   cineraceus) colonized IT during the post-management period. The bird
   assemblage in IT, as assessed by canonical correspondence analysis,
   shifted to open habitats, while the avifauna in NI became similar to
   that in CO over time. While post-fire treatment can provide new
   colonization opportunities for open-habitat dwellers, the slow
   colonization process, the low species richness, and the low bird
   abundance observed in large areas of IT indicate that post-fire
   treatment using salvage logging inhibits the restoration of forest bird
   communities by producing a poorer breeding bird community that is very
   different from the original one. Based on these lessons from the
   response to the Samcheok forest fire, we suggest that preserving as much
   of the disturbed forest as possible is essential, and that the current
   approach to post-fire treatment-intensive salvage logging-needs to be
   revised to ensure the effective restoration of breeding bird communities
   in disturbed temperate pine forests.}},

Abstract = {{Fires can heavily impact forest ecosystems but fire consequences for
   animal communities at burned and control sites are rarely investigated
   in natural forests. Here we present a 10-year study of post-fire beetle
   succession in natural ecosystem of Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland,
   being a hotspot for beetle fauna. We sampled beetles at burned and
   unburned (control) sites and compared local alpha and regional gamma
   diversity between treatments and over time. In total, 27,958 individuals
   belonging to 630 beetle species were recorded. Average species richness
   (alpha diversity) and density per sample was higher in burned forest
   than in control sites, and this difference was especially strong in case
   of all species pooled and pyrophilous species, but a reverse tendency
   was observed in case of rare beetles. These differences between
   treatments, however, were disappearing over time since fire. Similarly,
   beetle . communities occurring in burned and control sites were becoming
   more similar over time elapsed since fire. Gamma diversity (i.e. pooled
   regional species richness) was distinctly higher at burned sites
   compared to unburned, and the pattern was confirmed for all species,
   rare species and pyrophilous species. We conclude, that fire increases
   both alpha and gamma diversity of beetle community in natural forest and
   burned temperate forests left without intervention may host a rich
   beetle community. We propose, therefore, post-fire management should
   take these findings into account and consider prescribed burning as a
   conservation measure in Central European forests.}},

Abstract = {{Context Distance to seed source is often used to estimate seed
   dispersal-a process needed for post-fire tree recovery. However,
   distance, especially in mountainous terrain, does not capture pattern or
   scale-dependent effects controlling seed supply and delivery. Measuring
   seed source pattern (area and arrangement) could provide insights on how
   these spatial dynamics shape recovery. Objectives We tested metrics and
   investigated how seed source pattern, tree regeneration traits, scale,
   and terrain interact to shape post-fire tree recovery. Our research
   questions were: Does seed source pattern outperform distance when
   modeling tree species presence and regeneration density? If yes, does
   seed source pattern have scale-dependent or terrain-dependent effects on
   regeneration density? Methods We measured seed source pattern at nested
   spatial extents around 71 plots and related measurements to local
   post-fire tree recovery. We used generalized linear models to test
   metrics and visualize scale-dependent and terrain-dependent effects on
   regeneration density. Results Distance sufficiently modeled presence,
   but seed source pattern outperformed distance when modeling regeneration
   density. Relevant spatial extents and relationships were
   species-dependent. For wind-dispersed species, regeneration was
   associated with more seed source area and more complex arrangements, but
   terrain mediated these relationships. For serotinous and resprouting
   species, regeneration was associated with less seed source area and less
   complex arrangements, which are consistent with high-severity burn sites
   that promote recovery. Conclusions Seed source pattern supports spatial
   resilience and interacts with scale and terrain to shape regeneration
   density. Accounting for these spatial dynamics could help steward
   forests facing changing fire regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The critically endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus
   savannarum floridanus) is dependent on dry prairies managed with
   prescribed fires that are applied every 1-3 years. Timing of prescribed
   fires shifted from predominantly the dormant season (Jan-Mar) to the
   transition (Apr-Jun) and growing (Jul-Aug) seasons starting in the early
   2000s to better mimic natural fire regimes. Populations have continued
   to decline, however, and the presumption that natural fire regimes are
   beneficial to the small extant Florida grasshopper sparrow populations
   needs to be evaluated. We monitored 167 Florida grasshopper sparrow
   nests across 6 fire treatments at Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area,
   Osceola County, Florida, USA, 2013-2016, and investigated the role of
   fire season and interval on clutch initiation date, nest site selection,
   nest survival, productivity, and nestling mass. Clutch initiation was
   delayed by >= 33 days in prairies burned during the current transition
   season and we found no nests in prairies burned during the current
   growing season. Transition season burns also overlapped with the early
   breeding season, which could result in the destruction of nests.
   Clutches were larger at the beginning of the breeding season and
   nestling mass was highest in the middle of the breeding season,
   indicating that early and mid-season nests may be more valuable to
   annual fecundity than late-season nests. Florida grasshopper sparrows
   nested in prairies burned in the current dormant season or previous
   growing season more than expected based on their availability and as
   expected or less than expected in prairies burned in the current
   transition season, previous transition season, previous dormant season,
   or >2 years ago. However, we found no effect of fire treatment on daily
   nest survival, clutch size, number of fledglings per successful nest, or
   nestling mass. We recommend dormant season burning in prairies occupied
   by Florida grasshopper sparrows to increase reproductive potential given
   the subspecies' small population and the importance of each nest attempt
   to population growth. We recommend transition or growing season burns in
   unoccupied adjacent prairies to maintain high-quality dry prairie for
   nesting in future years. Prescribed fire management goals for Florida
   grasshopper sparrow populations should be guided by demographic
   responses rather than natural fire regimes. (c) 2019 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Tallgrass prairie butterfly surveys in recent decades in four states in

   including Speyeria idalia, Oarisma poweshiek, Atrytone arogos, Hesperia
   dacotae, and H. ottoe in fire-managed preserves, including large
   high-quality ones. These results replicate previous findings, indicating
   that upon initiation of conservation action, both cessation of prior
   management and inception of new management affect specialists negatively
   and that butterfly declines can be as great on reserves as non-reserves.
   Results at Wisconsin sites with species-specific management protocols,
   including permanent non-fire refugia, were more favorable for the
   specialists (S. idalia, Lycaeides melissa samuelis) the protocols were
   specifically designed to benefit. Butterfly declines after preservation
   will likely continue unless the conservation approach changes to include
   consideration of individual species' required resources and management
   tolerances. The ecosystem approach assumes that habitat specialists are
   co-evolved with processes such as fires assumed to maintain those
   ecosystems. Data presented here indicate that tallgrass prairie
   specialist butterflies are not co-evolved with current fire regimes. An
   alternate perspective views ecological processes as resetting vegetation
   to current climate and landscape conditions. Over geologic time, relict
   vegetation associations persist as outliers until an event resets them.
   In modern times, human disturbances (especially soil-exposing ones) can

Abstract = {{There is an intense debate about the effects of postfire salvage logging
   versus nonintervention policies on regeneration of forest communities,
   but scant information from experimental studies is available. We
   manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to
   experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species
   abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized
   block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established
   along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada
   Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of
   three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were
   established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an
   intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the
   trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we
   used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2
   consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses
   total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages.
   Salvage logged areas had species typical of open-and early-successional
   habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the
   unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost
   absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of mid-and
   late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and
   the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to
   unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural
   regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird
   species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50\% and
   richness by 40\%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape
   level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments.
   Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a
   mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide
   management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects.}},

Abstract = {{Upland hardwood forest managers are increasingly burning during the
   growing-season in hopes of improving wildlife habitat and attaining or
   accelerating other restoration goals, highlighting the need for research
   addressing how season of burning affects wildlife, including breeding
   birds. We used 1-ha strip transects in nine units before (2011) and
   after (2013-2016) treatments to experimentally assess how breeding birds
   respond to early growing-season (26 April 2013; GSB) and dormant-season
   (5 March 2014; DSB) burns, and controls (C). Burn effects on forest
   structure were minor and transitory, regardless of burn season. Burns
   did not affect overstory or midstory tree basal area or density; shrub
   cover did not significantly differ among treatments, but within GSB and
   DSB it decreased for 1-2 years post-burn. A trend of reduced leaf litter
   depth immediately following both burn treatments was apparent, and
   recovery was rapid. Percent canopy cover decreased slightly in GSB
   within four years post-burn. Total bird species richness and density did
   not differ among treatments or years, and no treatment x year
   interaction effects were detected. A treatment effect was detected for
   one of the 10 species tested; Red-bellied woodpecker density was greater
   in GSB than C in 2013 and 2015. No treatment x year interaction effect
   was detected for any tested species. Density of birds within the tree-,
   cavity-, and shrub and midstory-nesting guilds were not detectably
   affected by either burn treatment, but ground-nester density was lower
   in GSB and DSB than C in 2014. Our results indicate that single,
   low-intensity burns, regardless of burn season, are not an effective
   tool in creating suitable forest structure for disturbance-dependent
   breeding bird species, or changing breeding bird community composition.
   In the short-term, substantial forest overstory reduction by timber
   harvests or high-severity burns will likely be required to improve
   forest conditions for disturbance-dependent species, and to increase
   species richness and abundance of breeding birds.}},

   range of variability (NRV) using a state and transition model that
   included natural disturbances (e.g., wildfires, insect outbreaks) on a
   study area in northeast Oregon. We tracked the area of forests with
   large trees to assess potential trends of habitat for wildlife species
   closely associated with these forest structures and evaluated land
   allocations that restricted management practices on national forests
   (i.e., riparian and old-growth forests). We also specifically analyzed

Abstract = {{Grevillea rhizomatosa Olde \& Marriott (Proteaceae) is a threatened
   species of shrub known only from 12 populations within a 7 x 8 kin area
   within Gibraltar Range and Washpool National Parks, northern New South
   Wales, Australia. Prior to this study it was believed that the species
   only reproduced from rhizomatous suckers as seed and fruit were never
   detected in the wild. A concern for the reproductive and evolutionary
   potential of the species in the event of a catastrophic disturbance was
   the basis for an investigation into the reproductive ecology of G.
   rhizomatosa. Such an event occurred in October 2002 with an intense
   wildfire affecting most of the populations. Five populations were
   studied in detail for demography and fecundity prior to this fire and
   two populations were resurveyed in August 2005. In 2000, 916 individual
   stems were recorded across these populations and only small to large
   shrubs were found; no seedlings were recorded. Post-fire response was
   documented in two populations where plants were found to be resprouting
   and suckering from underground stems. In the pre-fire surveys of 2000
   and 2001 flowering occurred in all populations, but since the fire of
   October 2002 flowering has only occurred in unburnt habitats. Flowers on
   shrubs in two of the five populations failed to produce fruit, but low
   fruit-set (7-13\% of flowers) occurred in three populations. Seeds
   collected from two populations (n = 14) were tested for viability using

Abstract = {{Decades of fire suppression, logging, and overgrazing have led to
   increased densities of small diameter trees which have been associated
   with decreases in biodiversity, reduced habitat quality for wildlife
   species, degraded foraging conditions for ungulates, and more frequent
   and severe wildfires. In response, land managers are implementing forest
   restoration treatments using prescribed fire and thinning to mitigate
   the risk of catastrophic wildfires and improve habitat conditions for a
   variety of wildlife species. We monitored habitat selection by female
   mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in relation to forest restoration
   treatments and wildfires in northern New Mexico in 2015. Our specific
   objectives were to assess changes in forage abundance and determine
   habitat selection patterns of mule deer in relation to recent wildfires,
   forest restoration treatments, including duration of the post-treatment
   recovery, and other habitat characteristics. Herbaceous forage biomass
   was greater in wildfire-burned areas than in untreated areas or those
   treated with prescribed burns or thinning. Oak forage biomass was
   greater in wildfire-burned areas compared to prescribed burns, forest
   thinning, and untreated areas. However, thinned areas tended to have
   higher oak forage biomass than untreated areas. Mule deer selected for
   areas burned by prescribed fire and generally avoided wildfire-burned
   and thinned areas < 5 years old. Mule deer strongly selected for thinned
   areas a 5 years old. At both the landscape and home-range scale,
   grasslands were avoided during most seasons, pinyon-juniper woodlands
   were selected in winter, and oak vegetation and mixed-conifer forests
   were selected during summer. Our data suggests that mule deer may
   benefit from recent prescribed burns and older forest thinning, but the
   duration of post-treatment vegetation recovery influences the strength
   and direction of selection. Knowledge of the short- and long-term
   effects of restoration treatments will provide managers with the means
   to make more informed decisions regarding implementation of forest
   restoration and other vegetation treatments intended to benefit mule
   deer.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of burning and grazing on plant, ground beetle and spider
   species was investigated experimentally in stands of varying ages (burnt
   in 1982 and 1988 and unburnt plots) on an area of heather moorland in
   County Antrim, north-east Ireland. Burning initiated complex succession
   pathways which appear to have characteristic plant and invertebrate
   species associations. Removal of Calluna dominance initiated a period of
   high plant species diversity. Investigation of initial post-fire
   regeneration suggested that the frequency of occurrence of plant species
   changed over time and was affected by grazing. Grouping of species by
   the position of their renewal bud, i.e. their life-form, did not account
   for all observed interspecific variation. The dominant species after
   burning were Eriophorum vaginatum, E. angustifolium and Vaccinium
   myrtillus. Studies of vegetation canopy structure showed that, even with
   the exclusion of the main grazing herbivores, Calluna will not
   re-establish itself as the dominant species until several years after
   burning. The ground beetle Nebria salina was trapped more often on plots
   burnt in 1988 than on unburnt plots or those burnt in 1982. In
   comparison, Pterostichus niger and Carabus granulatus were trapped in
   greater numbers on plots burnt in 1982 than on unburnt plots and plots
   burnt in 1988. The large species Carabus problematicus and Carabus
   glabratus were trapped in greater numbers on unburnt plots. Similarly,
   more of the spiders Ceratinella brevipes and Centromerita concinna were
   trapped on the plots burnt in 1982. In comparison, Lepthyphantes
   zimmermanni and Robertus lividus were trapped more often on unburnt

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Resilience against fire disturbance of Mediterranean vegetation has been
   frequently described. However, due to climatic change and abandonment of
   local land use practices, the fire regime is changing, probably leading
   to higher intensities and frequencies of disturbance events. The
   forthcoming scenario calls for a full understanding of post-disturbance
   tree recruitment processes, structural resilience and possible
   consequences on the overall forest biodiversity. In particular,
   knowledge on severe crown fires' effects on forest stand structural
   attributes needs to be further explored. In this work, we describe and
   quantify fire impact and short-term response of a Mediterranean forest
   affected by high severity crown fires, focusing on the compositional and
   structural diversity of living and dead trees, spatial pattern of
   fire-induced mortality, recovery dynamics of tree species. The analysis,
   based on a synchronic approach, was carried out within four burned and
   two not burned fully stem-mapped research plots located in NW Italy,
   belonging to two forest categories differing for their main tree
   restoration strategies. Distance-dependent and distance-independent
   indices were applied to assess structural diversity dynamics over time
   since fire occurrence. Within the analyzed forests fire was found to
   affect mostly forest structure rather than its composition. Number of
   snags largely increases immediately after the fire, but it levels off
   due to their fall dynamics. Regeneration strategies and fire severity
   influenced species abundance and consequently diversity patterns. Stem
   diameter and height diversity were modified as well, with a strong
   increase in the first post-fire year and a sharp reduction six years
   after the disturbance. Fire determined also a higher heterogeneity in
   crown cover and vertical structure. Spatial patterns of surviving trees
   and snags were greatly affected by fire, producing an increase in
   aggregation and segregation mechanisms. Autosuccessional processes are
   supposed to preserve current forest structure and composition, but the
   ecosystem self-restoring capability should be analyzed in the light of
   the possible changes in fire regime.}},

   burned sites and sis unburned sites. We measured gross habitat features
   in 0.04-ha circles centered on each point count station. We calculated
   productivity estimates at nests of seven of the most common nesting
   species. Habitat components we measured in 1-, 2-, and 3-yr post-burn
   sites were similar, but most components differed between burned and
   unburned sites. Although 98 species were detected during point counts,
   we report only on the 46 species that nested in the area and were
   detected greater than or equal to 10\% of the counts in either habitat
   class. Twenty-one species preferred burned sites and six preferred
   unburned sites. Avian species richness and evenness were similar for
   burned and unburned sites. Burned sites were preferred for nesting over
   unburned sites. Only nine nests of six species were found in unburned
   sites. Productivity; estimates were low in burned sites. One or more
   eggs hatched in only 59 of 187 nests monitored, and an avenge of only
   0.82 chicks per nest were estimated to have fledged. Predation was the
   most common probable cause for nest failure, ranging from 45\% in the
   Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) to 64\% in the Summer Tanager
   (Piranga rubra). Because the sources of predation at the refuge are

   Change}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: Big environmental disturbances have big ecological effects,
   yet these are not always what we might expect. Understanding the
   proximate effects of major disturbances, such as severe wildfires, on
   individuals, populations and habitats will be essential for
   understanding how predicted future increases in the frequency of such
   disturbances will affect ecosystems. However, researchers rarely have
   access to data from immediately before and after such events. Here we
   report on the effects of a severe and extensive forest wildfire on
   mortality, reproductive output and availability of key shelter resources
   for an arboreal marsupial. We also investigated the behavioural response
   of individuals to changed shelter resource availability in the post-fire
   environment.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We fitted proximity-logging
   radiotransmitters to mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus
   cunninghami) before, during and after the 2009 wildfires in Victoria,
   Australia. Surprisingly, we detected no mortality associated with the
   fire, and despite a significant post-fire decrease in the proportion of
   females carrying pouch young in the burnt area, there was no short-term
   post-fire population decline. The major consequence of this fire for
   mountain brushtail possums was the loss of over 80\% of hollow-bearing
   trees. The types of trees preferred as shelter sites (highly decayed
   dead standing trees) were those most likely to collapse after fire.
   Individuals adapted to resource decline by being more flexible in
   resource selection after the fire, but not by increased resource
   sharing.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite short-term demographic resilience and
   behavioural adaptation following this fire, the major loss of decayed
   hollow trees suggests the increased frequency of stand-replacing
   wildfires predicted under climate change will pose major challenges for
   shelter resource availability for hollow-dependent fauna. Hollow-bearing
   trees are typically biological legacies of previous forest generations
   in post-fire regrowth forests but will cease to be recruited to future
   regrowth forests if the interval between severe fires becomes too rapid
   for hollow formation.}},

Abstract = {{Drought is a naturally occurring phenomenon affecting various aspects of
   life. Lack of understanding of the phenomenon is one of the reasons for
   its adverse impact. It is therefore of great importance to assess and
   characterize drought to plan appropriate management measures. In this
   study we attempted to characterize the droughts in the East District of
   Sikkim during the winter. Winter droughts (Oct-Mar) are a major cause of
   concern in Sikkim, responsible for reduction of productivity in
   high-value horticultural crops, incidence of pests and diseases, forest
   fires and non-availability of water for domestic purposes. For the
   characterization of drought the reconnaissance drought index (RDI) was
   applied using the data available for the period 1985-2012. From the
   analysis it could be seen that drought is experienced for 66.7 and
   59.3\% of time in the periods Oct-Dec and Jan-Mar. The droughts in the
   district followed the Wakeby frequency distribution function. The
   probability and return period were also estimated and it could be
   observed that every three years the district experiences drought.
   Specific management measures are necessary to minimize the adverse
   impact of drought. Some of the measures applicable to Sikkim are also

Abstract = {{Abandonment of traditional farming practices, such as hay-making and
   pasturing, has resulted in rapid loss of open wet grassland habitats in
   Europe. The globally threatened Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola
   L.) is a bird species that occurs almost exclusively in open fen mires,
   which have virtually disappeared in Western Europe, but still persist
   locally in Eastern Europe. Focusing on the world's most important
   breeding site for Aquatic Warbler, the Zvaniec fen mire in Belarus, we
   estimated Belarusian citizens' willingness-to-pay for adequate
   conservation management of this fen mire and its focal species the
   Aquatic Warbler. Results from a discrete choice experiment indicated
   that Belarusian citizens were willing to pay for appropriate
   conservation programmes of the Zvaniec fen mire. Scything and mechanical
   mowing were preferred compared to controlled burning, and especially
   over herbicide treatment of encroaching shrubs. Conservation management
   was preferred over legal protection of wetland areas without management.
   Respondents considered such passive conservation to be insufficient to
   maintain open fen mire habitat and gave a higher priority to active
   conservation management programmes. These preferences are consistent
   with evidence-based knowledge about what is effective conservation
   management for the Aquatic Warbler. Given the gradual disappearance of
   Europe's traditional cultural landscapes, we discuss the challenge to

Abstract = {{Salvage logging in burned forests can negatively affect habitat for
   white-headed woodpeckers (Dryobates albolarvatus), a species of
   conservation concern, but also meets socioeconomic demands for timber
   and human safety. Habitat suitability index (HSI) models can inform
   forest management activities to help meet habitat conservation
   objectives. Informing post-fire forest management, however, involves
   model application at new locations as wildfires occur, requiring
   evaluation of predictive performance across locations. We developed HSI
   models for white-headed woodpeckers using nest sites from two
   burned-forest locations in Oregon, the Toolbox (2002) and Canyon Creek
   (2015) fires. We measured predictive performance by developing one model
   at each of the two locations and quantifying discrimination of nest from
   reference sites at two other wildfire locations where the model had not
   been developed (either Toolbox or Canyon Creek, and the Barry Point Fire
   {[}2011]). We developed and evaluated Maxent models based on remotely
   sensed environmental metrics to support habitat mapping, and weighted
   logistic regression (WLR) models that combined remotely sensed and
   field-collected metrics to inform management prescriptions. Both Maxent
   and WLR models developed either at Canyon Creek or Toolbox performed
   adequately to inform management when applied at the alternate Toolbox or
   Canyon Creek location, respectively (area under the
   receiver-operating-characteristic curve {[}AUC] range = 0.61-0.72) but
   poorly when applied at Barry Point (AUC = 0.53-0.57). The final HSI
   models fitted to Toolbox and Canyon Creek data quantified suitable
   nesting habitat as severely burned or open sites adjacent to lower
   severity and closed canopy sites, where foraging presumably occurs. We
   suggest these models are applicable at locations similar to development
   locations but not at locations resembling Barry Point, which were
   characterized by more (pre-fire) canopy openings, larger diameter trees,
   less ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and more juniper (Juniperus
   occidentalis). Considering our results, we recommend caution when
   applying HSI models developed at individual wildfire locations to inform
   postfire management at new locations without first evaluating predictive

Abstract = {{Upland, mixed-oak forests in the eastern United States have experienced
   widespread oak regeneration failure, largely due to cessation of
   anthropogenic disturbance. Silvicultural practices used to promote
   advance oak regeneration may affect ground-dwelling mammals. From May to
   August 2008 (pre-treatment), 2010 (first year post-treatment), and 2011
   (second year post-treatment), we trapped small mammals to assess changes
   in species richness and abundance following experimental tests of three
   silvicultural treatments (prescribed burns, midstory herbicide
   applications, and shelterwood harvests) used to promote oak
   regeneration. We trapped small mammals in five replicates of each
   treatment and controls using Sherman live traps (2008 and 2010) and
   drift fences (2008, 2010, and 2011). From pre- to post-treatment, we
   evaluated the change in estimated peromyscid abundance and relative
   abundance of masked shrews (Sorex cinereus), smoky shrews (Sorex
   fumeus), and northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda).
   Additionally, we evaluated the change in species richness across
   treatments for both sampling techniques. For all measures analyzed
   (i.e., species richness, peromyscid abundance, and relative abundance of
   shrews), the change from pre- to post-treatment did not differ among
   treatments. However, more masked shrews, smoky shrews, and northern
   short-tailed shrews were captured in 2011 (i.e., second year
   post-treatment) than in 2010 (i.e., first year post-treatment). Our
   research indicates that, in the short-term, small mammals (e.g., mice
   and shrews) can tolerate a wide range of forest disturbance following
   oak regeneration treatments. However, delayed treatment effects (e.g.,
   additional post-herbicide midstory dieback) or additive changes
   following future treatments (e.g., prescribed burns following
   shelterwood harvests or multiple prescribed burns) may compound effects
   on small mammal populations, and should be assessed with long-term
   research (> 2 years post-treatment). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The paper considers indicators of the dynamics of plant communities with
   Paeonia tenuifolia before and after fire impact. Studies were conducted
   in the Khvalynsky National Park (forest-steppe zone of Russia) in
   2008-2018. The authors conducted a complex study in burned and unburned
   plant communities. An assessment of the effects of fire impact and the
   development of a post-fire action plan were considered in the Protected
   Area. The plant community Paeonia tenuifolia + Calamagrostis epigejos +
   Adonis vernalis - Potentilla volgarica burned down in 2009. The plant
   community Paeonia tenuifolia + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis - Anemone
   sylvestris was unburned. To characterise plant communities with Paeonia
   tenuifolia and its coenopopulations, we used standard geobotanical
   description methods. Sixty seven vascular plant species were part of the
   post-fire phytocoenosis. Of them, 14 species are included in the Red
   Data Book of the Saratov region. Changes in the post-fire plant
   community have occurred in the following order: 1) Paeonia tenuifolia +
   Calamagrostis epigejos + Adonis vernalis - Stipa pennata (in 2008) -> 2)
   Paeonia tenuifolia + Elymus repens + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis +
   Thalictrum simplex (in 2010) -> 3) Paeonia tenuifolia - Stipa pennata -
   Calamagrostis epigejos + Festuca valesiaca + Phleum pratense + Poa
   bulbosa + Prunus tenella (in 2011) -> 4) Paeonia tenuifolia + Adonis
   vernalis + Stipa pennata (in 2015, 2017, 2018). After the fire influence
   on a plant community, the following changes took place: 1) annuals and
   ruderal plant species appeared and increased their abundance; 2) the
   ratio of dominant species has changed. In 2012-2018, the phytocenotic
   role of Calamagrostis epigejos decreased, while the coverage and
   abundance of Stipa pennata increased at the same period. The abundance
   dynamics of Paeonia tenuifolia decreased in 2010, while in 2015-2018,
   its value gradually increased. The species richness of the
   post-pyrogenic plant community varied from 20 species in the first
   post-fire year to 38 species in the last study year. In the first
   post-fire year, the families Poaceae (six species), Leguminosae plants
   (three species), Rosaceae plants (three species) occupied the leading
   positions. During the post-pyrogenic succession, the dominant position
   of the listed families was not changing. Species of Compositae, Poaceae,
   Ranunculaceae families prevailed in the unburned plant community. Steppe
   plants dominated in the post-fire plant community: Stipa pennata, Adonis
   vernalis, and Paeonia tenuifolia. The leading ecologic-coenotic groups
   were steppe plants (70\%), meadow plants (16\%), forest plants (5\%),
   and ruderal plants (9\%). Weed-steppe plants were indicators of habitat
   disturbance by human activities. Among weed-steppe plants, there were
   Arenaria serpyllifolia, Viola rupestris, Erysimum canescens, Verbascum
   lychnitis. Gradient analysis of environmental conditions showed that the
   highest value of the vitality index (IVC = 1.15) corresponds to the best
   conditions for the growth and survival of the Paeonia tenuifolia
   population in the post-fire community. In the control site, the vitality
   index (IVC = 0.85) corresponded to unfavourable conditions for plant
   development. We studied the age spectra of the natural Paeonia
   tenuifolia populations in the burned and unburned communities. We showed
   that both populations were normal, complete, and young. The fire-damaged
   populations were younger than the populations in the unburned
   communities.
   We suggest the need of comprehensive monitoring studies to properly
   assess the fire effects and subsequent management actions for the
   vegetation restoration after fire influence.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, land-use changes have made Mediterranean forests
   highly susceptible to wildfires, which can cause several impacts not
   only on burnt areas, but also on adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Post-fire
   runoff from burnt areas may transport toxic substances to streams by
   surface runoff, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   metals, which can be noxious to aquatic organisms. Impacts on aquatic
   ecosystems can be related to fire severity, forest type and the exposure
   period; however, these factors have not been investigated in tandem.
   Here, we used the stream detrital system to determine the impacts of
   post-fire runoffs and stream water from a burnt catchment on trophic
   interactions between stream microbial communities and invertebrate
   shredders involved in leaf litter decomposition. Three distinct types of
   samples were collected from a burnt catchment: post-fire runoffs from
   high severity wildfires in Pinus and Eucalyptus forests, and stream
   water. Microbial decomposer communities (fungi and bacteria) and the
   invertebrate shredder Allogamus ligonifer were exposed for 10 and 20
   days to increasing concentrations (0, 50, 75 and 100\%) of runoff
   extracts. Our results showed that post-tire runoffs from high severity
   wildfires reduced microbially-driven leaf litter decomposition (up to
   79\%), invertebrate feeding (up to 75\%), fungal biomass (up to 39\%)
   and altered community composition; effects were more severe at the
   longer exposure time. The impacts varied with the runoff source and were
   related to the chemical composition in metals and total PAHs. This study
   emphasizes the importance of assessing the indirect effects of wildfires
   taking into account the effects of the runoff source, load and exposure
   time on freshwater biota and their ecological functions. Therefore, best
   forest management practices should be applied to minimize post-fire
   runoffs reaching aquatic ecosystems and to reduce the effects of these
   extreme events on freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. (C)

Abstract = {{Ecological disturbances structure plant communities. In areas where
   reintroducing natural disturbances is unfeasible, land managers use
   artificial disturbances, such as fire and mowing, to simulate natural
   disturbances. However, prescribed fire and mowing can promote or inhibit
   seedling survival in plant populations. Lupinus perennis (the wild blue
   lupine) is a potentially threatened species commonly subjected to
   rotations of burning and mowing treatments to restore habitat for
   endangered butterflies (e.g., Karner blue, Lycaeides melissa sameulis).
   While L. perennis adults respond favorably to these management
   techniques, it is unknown how these variable management programs affect
   natural seedling recruitment and establishment. We quantified natural L.
   perennis seedling survival in seven managed remnant oak savannas in
   Northwest Ohio in 2007 and 2008. To evaluate the roles of management
   history and environmental factors on recruitment, we obtained burning
   and mowing management records for each savanna, measured environmental
   variables at each seedling, and assessed their relationships with
   seedling mortality. Seedling survival varied among the savannas and
   increased with greater fern and grass stems, moss cover, soil moisture,
   and initial size, but was reduced by increased oak saplings, light
   levels, and topographic wetness. Site elevation and initial seedling
   size affected the sizes of the juvenile plants. Management activities
   did not directly influence seedling survival or density, but the number
   of fires and total management activities at a site were positively
   correlated with oak saplings, suggesting current management practices
   may indirectly reduce lupine survival. Future management strategies may
   increase recruitment by focusing on the restoration of multiple species
   that are important components of the lupine regeneration niche.}},

Abstract = {{The Otway Ranges contain many of the highest-wildfire-risk communities
   in Victoria, Australia. One of the chief risk mitigation measures in the
   Otway Ranges is planned burning. The location and amount of planned
   burning that is undertaken need to consider stakeholder perspectives
   that can be largely divergent, invoking difficult trade-offs for
   land-management agencies. The structured decision-making framework was
   utilised to select the most `appropriate' 40-year cross-tenure fuel
   management strategy for the Otway Ranges. This paper details the
   approach undertaken to develop an optimised set of multi-objective fuel
   management strategies, identify suitable monetary and non-monetary
   objectives and calculate risk-weighted consequences using a range of
   modelling techniques. To underpin clarity in trade-offs and decision
   making, we emphasise the use of natural measures of performance for each
   candidate strategy against each objective, such as lives lost, species
   decline and economic losses associated with wildfire. This paper also
   highlights the role of stakeholder engagement throughout the
   decision-making process. We discuss the results of the formal trade-off
   process that was completed using an additive multi-objective value model
   to identify a preferred fuel management strategy for the Otway Ranges.
   The preferred strategy is currently used by local management agencies to
   guide operational planning and delivery.}},

Title = {{Landscape heterogeneity influences the response of grassland birds to
   energy development}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands are inherently dynamic systems having developed with frequent
   disturbance from fire and grazing that varies in space and time to
   create heterogeneity. Today, many management practices emphasize the
   even use of grasslands by grazers and either no fire or uniform fires,
   resulting in grasslands that lack the variability in plant structure and
   composition to support the entire suite of grassland biodiversity.
   Previous research has suggested that the reintroduction of variable
   disturbance may be among the best conservation strategies for grassland
   birds, as these practices promote diversity and abundance of many
   species. However, the reintroduction of heterogeneity is taking place in
   the context of the continued development of grasslands for energy
   production, and the utility of heterogeneity based management practices
   may decline in fragmented landscapes. We investigated how fragmentation
   from oil and gas may constrain management efforts to promote
   biodiversity by evaluating changes in bird abundance with distance from
   roads and conventional oil wells across a gradient of times since fire.
   We found that time since fire was the primary driver of grassland bird
   distribution, with dickcissels, eastern meadowlark and grasshopper
   sparrows occurring in all vegetation patches, while Henslow's sparrows
   primarily occurred in patches that were greater than 13 months post-fire
   and upland sandpipers were mostly detected in recent burns. Further,
   Henslow's sparrows avoided oil wells for considerable distances, while
   eastern meadowlark was more abundant in areas close to oil wells in
   vegetation patches that were one-year post-fire. Grasshopper sparrows
   avoided roads in recent burns and dickcissels, and eastern meadowlarks
   were attracted to roads in patches that were recently burned and
   one-year post-fire, respectively. The restoration of heterogeneous fire
   regimes will benefit bird communities by creating variable vegetation
   structure that can support multiple grassland bird species; however,
   energy development has the potential to fragment grasslands for some
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, the mean abundance of terrestrial animals has fallen by 50\%
   since 1970, and populations face ongoing threats associated with habitat
   loss, fragmentation, climate change, and disturbance. Climate change can
   influence the quality of remaining habitat directly and indirectly by
   precipitating increases in the extent, frequency, and severity of
   natural disturbances, such as fire. Species face the combined threats of
   habitat clearance, changing climates, and altered disturbance regimes,
   each of which may interact and have cascading impacts on animal
   populations. Typically, conservation agencies are limited in their
   capacity to mitigate rates of habitat clearance, habitat fragmentation,
   or climate change, yet fire management is increasingly used worldwide to
   reduce wildfire risk and achieve conservation outcomes. A popular
   approach to ecological fire management involves the creation of fire
   mosaics to promote animal diversity. However, this strategy has 2
   fundamental limitations: the effect of fire on animal movement within or
   among habitat patches is not considered and the implications of the
   current fire regime for long-term population persistence are overlooked.
   Spatial and temporal patterns in fire history can influence animal
   movement, which is essential to the survival of individual animals,
   maintenance of genetic diversity, and persistence of populations,
   species, and ecosystems. We argue that there is rich potential for fire
   managers to manipulate animal movement patterns; enhance functional
   connectivity, gene flow, and genetic diversity; and increase the
   capacity of populations to persist under shifting environmental
   conditions. Recent methodological advances, such as spatiotemporal
   connectivity modeling, spatially explicit individual-based simulation,
   and fire-regime modeling can be integrated to achieve better outcomes
   for biodiversity in human-modified, fire-prone landscapes.

   using fire to sustain or enhance functional connectivity.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION GENETICS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Many threatened species suffer reduced genetic diversity as a result of
   small population size and isolation. However, species with a persistent
   seed bank may be buffered against genetic loss as seed banks are
   expected to accumulate the reproductive output of many seasons. For
   fire-dependent species in decline, prescribed ecological burning may be
   a means to stimulate germination and recover genetic diversity stored in
   the seed bank, providing a demographic and genetic rescue effect. Here
   we investigated the effectiveness of this strategy in a small, isolated
   and inbred population of the endangered shrub, Acacia pinguifolia. We
   surveyed genetic diversity and structure of remnant populations of A.
   pinguifolia and monitored regeneration before and after burning.
   Germination was stimulated by fire, but seedling numbers 18 months
   post-fire were low and barely above the number of adults killed by the
   fire. Genetic diversity was marginally higher in the post-fire seedling
   cohort than the pre-fire adults (H(E) = 0.1 vs. 0.09, respectively).
   Outcrossing rates of open-pollinated seed from surrounding plants
   suggested moderately high levels of self-fertilisation (t (m) = 0.65)
   and analysis of fine-scale genetic structure implied pollen and seed
   dispersal over distances of several metres, suggesting that restricted
   gene flow and inbreeding may act to limit genetic diversity in the seed
   bank. We conclude that prescribed burning has not been immediately
   successful as a recovery strategy for this relictual population of A.
   pinguifolia, though future monitoring may detect additional recruits.
   Alternative conservation strategies, including performing
   inter-population crosses, may be required to restore genetic diversity
   and ameliorate extinction risks.}},

Abstract = {{Reductions in fire frequency and changing land use and management have
   enabled woody plant species to increase in grasslands worldwide.
   Nevertheless, fire is seldom eliminated from grasslands and the survival
   of woody shrubs depends on their fire-resistance traits and their
   ability to tolerate fire through regeneration from basal and aerial
   meristems. We assessed how season of fire affected growth, stem
   densities, and mortality rates of Jersey tea (Ceanothus herbaceus) and
   smooth sumac (Rhus glabra), two common shrubs of North American
   grasslands, in ungrazed sites. Additionally, we measured relative
   frequency and cover at various topographical positions on watersheds
   seasonally burned for 12 y, long-term unburned sites, and sites burned
   every 4 y. Although, spring, fall, and winter fires resulted in 100\%
   stem mortality, fire stimulated increased basal resprouting, resulting
   in positive stem population growth rates. By contrast, populations in
   unburned and summer-burned sites showed lower mortality rates, both
   basal and aerial resprouting, but lower resprouting rates and lower
   population growth rates. Stem densities in spring-, fall-, and
   winter-burned sites increased significantly during the early growing
   season, but declined thereafter. Unburned areas did not show any change,
   while summer-burned populations showed continually decreasing stem
   densities. Therefore, our preliminary data suggest that summer burning
   may be a more effective management tool in reducing shrub densities and
   population growth rates in grasslands than spring burning, the most
   common management practice in the Flint Hills region. However, summer
   watersheds are only burned every 2 y because of insufficient fuel loads
   and these data may not show a full oscillation of stem-density dynamics.
   Genet (clone) populations were characterized by stable densities and low
   flux, whereas intraclonal ramet (stem) densities showed high turnover
   rates with fire, suggesting that frequent fire strongly influences the
   demography but not the genetic structure of clonal shrub populations.}},

Abstract = {{The reintroduction of fire to historically fire-prone forests has been

   evaluated mortality patterns for two common genera in the western US,

   of trees >50 DBH were similar for Pinus (4.6\% yr(-1)) and Abies (4.0\%

   of post-fire mortality probabilities suggested statistically significant

Abstract = {{Frequent, low-intensity fires were a common feature of Sierran forest
   ecosystems, but suppression policies over the past century have left
   many forests at risk for catastrophic wildfires. Recent policies
   highlight the use of prescribed burning or harvesting as fire risk
   reduction tools, but few studies have investigated the impacts of these
   management practices on the leaf litter fauna of Sierran forests. This
   study examines how three fire and ``fire surrogate{''} treatments,
   prescribed burning, overstory thinning with understory mastication, and
   combined thinning and burning, impact diversity and abundance of
   Coleoptera and other leaf litter arthropods. Pitfall trapping was used
   to collect litter arthropods before and immediately after treatments in
   replicated forest compartments. The diverse Coleoptera assemblage was
   dominated by only a few common species, with many rare species
   represented by only one or two individuals. Rank-abundance diagrams
   indicated that much of the change in the beetle assemblage due to the
   treatments was a result of changes in the numbers of rare species.
   Indicator species analysis showed several species closely allied with
   the treated compartments, but few with the untreated controls. Both NMS
   and CCA ordination show considerable change in overall assemblage
   structure on compartments treated with fire, but less change in the
   thinned compartments. Coleoptera species richness was slightly higher in
   burned compartments. Some common beetle species, families of beetles,
   and other common groups such as ants and spiders showed changes in
   abundance due to the treatments, but the changes were taxon-specific and
   showed no general pattern. Overall impacts of the treatments appear to
   be moderate, and the increased habitat heterogeneity at the compartment
   level may provide additional habitat for many rare species to coexist.
   We conclude that the use of fire and fire surrogate treatments in
   Sierran mixed-conifer forests is justified from the standpoint of their
   effects on leaf litter arthropods, but the history of management at the

Abstract = {{Fire is a significant determinant of vegetation structure in Australia's
   savannas and has been implicated in the decline of many species.
   Identifying the patterns of fire in the landscape is fundamental to
   understanding vegetation dynamics but variation over time and space
   makes generalization difficult and specific management recommendations
   elusive. In order to improve the knowledge base for fire management in
   tropical savannas, we investigated interregional variation in fire
   patterns in two Queensland bioregions, the Mount Isa Inlier (MII) and
   CapeYork Peninsula (CYP), over a 5-year period (1999-2003). Remotely
   sensed satellite data were used to identify burnt areas on a monthly
   basis for the western half of the CYP bioregion and about two-thirds of
   the smaller MII. Fire scars were mapped from JPEG-compressed,
   low-resolution Landsat images using geographical information system
   technology and data were investigated to determine annual burning
   patterns. Patterns were interpreted with regard to meteorological
   information and recent fire history. The area burnt per annum on western
   CYP was generally an order of magnitude greater than the area burnt on
   the MII. In the biggest fire year, nearly 74\% (5 295 098 ha) of the CYP
   landscape burnt, compared with 35\% (1 770 771 ha) of the MII landscape.
   The minimum percentage of the CYP study area burnt in 1 year between
   1999 and 2003 was 43.1\%, compared with 1.6\% for the MII. The
   reliability and amount of seasonal rainfall was a strong determinant of
   differences in time of fire occurrence and area burnt between regions.
   Widespread wildfires were significantly related to above average
   rainfall in the preceding 12 months in the Mt. Isa area but not in CYP.
   Rainfall also affected fire frequency. Predictable wet season rainfall
   on CYP allowed for a biennial fire return interval, while on the
   semiarid MII, the average fire return interval was 5 years or longer. We
   conclude that the fire patterns in the semiarid MII are similar to those
   reported for and Australia, while fire patterns in western CYP are
   comparable with other mesic savanna areas.}},

Abstract = {{Balancing land management and restoration goals for ecosystems and for
   individual species can create challenges. Here we describe the responses
   of two federally endangered plants to experimental restoration of
   fire-suppressed xeric longleaf pine/wiregrass (sandhill) habitat on the
   Lake Wales Ridge in south-central Florida. We compared responses to
   prescribed fire with (saw \& burn treatment) and without (burn-only
   treatment) prior felling of the oak subcanopy to an untreated control.
   We conducted a 7-year study of the demography of two endemic plants,
   scrub buckwheat (Eriogonum longifolium var. gnaphalifolium) and scrub
   plum (Prunus geniculata). Scrub buckwheat responded positively to the
   burn treatments, with high survival, positive growth, and increased
   flowering in both treatments. Likewise, scrub plum had high survival in
   all treatments, although severely burned, fire-consumed plants were more
   likely to die. Fire benefits scrub plum by increasing flowering 2-3
   years after fire. These results for these two endemic species are
   consistent with vegetation studies in long-unburned Lake Wales Ridge
   sandhills in suggesting that chainsaw felling of the subcanopy can be an
   effective pre-burn treatment and, when followed by fire, can be useful
   in ``speeding up{''} restoration. The ultimate goal of sandhill
   restoration, the return of a frequent low-intensity fire regime, will
   benefit scrub buckwheat and scrub plum. In this case, management for
   ecosystem goals benefits two of its rare component species.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fires have been used as a forest vegetation management tool
   in the eastern United States during the past decade, but concerns have
   been raised about direct or indirect adverse effects on Neotropical
   migrant bird species that nest in forest interior habitats. Prescribed
   fires were set in 1993 and 1995 in a mature hardwood forest in southern
   Indiana, USA, to reduce shade-tolerant understory woody vegetation and
   thereby increase the abundance and diversity of ground layer vegetation
   and seedlings of tree species that require moderate light levels (e.g.,
   Quercus L. spp.). The objective of this study was to determine if
   prescribed fires reduced the abundance or reproductive success of
   ground- and shrub-nesting Neotropical migrant bird species. The burned
   area and an adjacent unburned area were studied during the summers of
   1996 and 1997. An unlimited-radius point count method was used to
   determine relative abundance. Nests were monitored to determine fledging
   success. Vegetation structure was quantified at nest sites and at random
   points to assess fire effects and bird nest-site selection. Abundance of
   birds in this nesting guild was greater in the unburned area during both
   years. The greatest difference in abundance was for ovenbird (Seiurus
   aurocappilus Linnaeus). The probability of nest success for all bird
   species in this nesting guild combined, determined by the Mayfield
   method, was significantly lower in the burned area (0.125) than in the
   unburned area (0.291). Abundance of the brood parasite brown-headed
   cowbird (Molothrus ater Boddaert) did not differ between burned and
   unburned areas. However, the probability of nest success for parasitized
   nests (0.140) was lower than that of unparasitized nests (0.735). The
   mean number of host young fledged from successful nests was
   significantly lower in parasitized nests (1.3) than from unparasitized
   nests (3.0). Prescribed fires significantly reduced vegetative cover in
   the burned area. Nest sites in the burned area had higher vegetative
   cover than random points, indicating that birds may have selected nest
   sites that were less affected by the fire. While prescribed fires that
   burn in a ``natural{''} hit-or-miss pattern may retain nesting habitat
   for bird species in this nesting guild, lower nest success in the burned
   area indicates that management for desirable vegetation and for this
   nesting guild may not be compatible within the same forest. stand at the
   same time. This argues for planning at a landscape level to attain
   objectives for both vegetation composition and maintenance of bird

Abstract = {{Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is
   now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded
   Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest
   ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter
   birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining
   habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may
   influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for
   Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the
   winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested
   experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in
   1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest
   Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring
   burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling,
   and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We
   also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental
   reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction
   techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9
   and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1993 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in
   felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to
   significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows
   (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and
   an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In
   contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species
   composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of
   hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Bacolophus
   bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative
   uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine
   Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both
   winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling
   and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same
   tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least
   likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the
   control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following
   increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control,
   spring burn (41\%), felling and girdling (62\%), and herbicide (92\%).
   Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging
   condition because it was eight times less expensive than other
   techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance has long been a central issue in amphibian conservation,
   often regarding negative effects of logging or other forest management
   activities, but some amphibians seem to prefer disturbed habitats. After
   documenting increased use of recently burned forests by boreal toads
   (Bufo boreas), we hypothesized that burned habitats provided improved
   thermal opportunities in terrestrial habitats. We tested this hypothesis
   by conducting a radio telemetry study of habitat use (reported
   previously) and by using physical models that simulated the temperature
   of adult toads. We deployed 108 physical models in and adjacent to a
   1-year old burn using a fully-replicated design with three burn
   severities (unburned, partial, high severity) and four microhabitats
   (open surface, under vegetation, under log, in burrow). Model
   temperatures were compared to a range of preferred temperatures in
   published studies. We found 70\% more observations within the preferred
   temperature range of B. boreas in forests burned with high severity than
   in unburned areas. Burned forest was warmer than unburned forest across
   all microhabitats, but the largest relative difference was in burrows,
   which averaged 3 C warmer in high-severity burn areas and remained
   warmer though the night. More than twice as many observations were
   within the preferred temperature range in high-severity burrows than in
   unburned burrows. Areas burned with high severity were still warmer than
   unburned forest 3 years after the fire. Habitat use of toads during the
   concurrent radio telemetry study matched that predicted by the physical
   models. These results suggest there are fitness-linked benefits to toads
   using burned habitats, such as increased growth, fertility, and possibly
   disease resistance. However, increased soil temperatures that result
   from wildfire may be detrimental to other amphibian species that prefer
   cooler temperatures and stable environments. More broadly, our data
   illustrate the use of physical models to measure and interpret changes
   that amphibians may experience from disturbance, and highlight the need
   for research linking vital rates such as growth and survival to
   disturbance. (C) Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{1 The United States Forest Service conducted an oak savanna restoration
   using thinning and prescribed burning in the Manistee National Forest in
   Michigan to provide additional habitat for species dependent on this
   rare community type, including the Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides

   defoliators, such as European gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar).
   2 Although gypsy moths are invasive in North America, several native
   predators, such as white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), other small
   mammals and invertebrates, help keep gypsy moth populations at
   nondestructive levels.
   3 The present study investigated whether the small mammal community and
   gypsy moth predation rates were affected by the type of mechanical
   forest thinning method (bulldozer, masticator, shear cutter) used during
   an oak savanna restoration at two sites in Michigan within the
   suppression zone in 2010 and 2011.
   4 Predation rates on gypsy moth pupae were higher in bulldozer and shear

   White-footed mice relative abundance was significantly higher in thinned

   pasture. Nesting habitat was affected little by stocking rate in PBG
   management regimes because preferred nest sites were unburned patches
   that were not grazed by cattle. Overall, the quantity and quality of
   nesting sites was improved under PBG management when compared with more

Abstract = {{Fire is an intrinsic component of many natural ecosystems. In
   human-modified landscapes that occur in fire-driven ecosystems, it can
   be difficult to make fire management decisions, as there must be a
   trade-off between ideal conservation management and the practicalities
   of management in an altered landscape. We assess how biodiversity is
   influenced by differences in fire regime in a landscape fragmented by
   timber production. Here, optimal fire management for maintaining
   grassland integrity is not always possible, due to logistical
   constraints and fire risk to plantations. We investigate thicket
   establishment arising from reduced fire frequency, and how this affects
   butterfly diversity, assemblage structure, indicator species and species
   associations to larval host plants with different growth forms.
   Butterflies were sampled along a gradient of woodiness in large-scale
   conservation corridors that separate timber compartments. The two
   extreme stages along the successional gradient, recently burned
   grassland and natural forests, supported relatively diverse and
   complementary butterfly assemblages. Grassland corridors without fire
   for 2 years were as high in butterfly diversity and similar in
   composition to recently burned grasslands. However, corridors without
   fire for >5 years were encroached by thicket and supported lower
   butterfly diversity. Thicket, with its intermediate vegetation
   character, was poor habitat for species adapted to either open grassland
   or to forests. Also, thicket-encroached areas carry high fire risk to
   plantations. Synthesis and applications. In this fragmented, fire-driven
   ecosystem, there is more than one burning strategy for achieving
   positive biodiversity outcomes. We recommend a divergent management
   approach that covers both extremes of the fire frequency continuum, with
   the choice depending on the stage of succession and management logistics
   for each site: (a) frequent burning to prevent woody encroachment in
   less-encroached, logistically easier sites or (b) letting succession run
   its course through thicket to forest by excluding fire in heavily
   encroached, logistically challenging sites. Both options are practicable
   and maintain biotopes that have high value for butterfly conservation
   and low fire risk to plantations. This divergent management approach is
   a flexible strategy that benefits both conservation and commercial
   interests across fire-prone plantation mosaics.}},

Abstract = {{Drivers of forest fire are complex and may spatially vary between
   different ecosystems; thus their identification is critical for the
   development of effective fire management strategies. Here we identified
   the spatial distribution trend and drivers of forest fire over the
   period of 2000-2016 in the boreal and subtropical forest ecosystems in
   China using trend analysis and the geographically weighted negative
   binomial regression model (GWNBR). The results reveal that forest fires
   were generally shifting from the boreal to sub-tropical region and that
   there were significant (p < 0.05) spatial differences in fire drivers
   between boreal and subtropical forest ecosystems. Forest fires in the
   boreal ecosystem were driven by meteorological, topographic and human
   factors that had clear spatial variation. In contrast, forest fire
   occurrence in subtropical forest ecosystem was spatially stationary;
   i.e., constant throughout the area. Our results suggest that as
   socio-economy continues developing, the influence of human factors on
   forest fires in different ecosystems will be more complex. Future
   national forest fire management policies should consider local condition
   to establish region-specific management strategies due to significant
   spatial differences in major forest fire drivers between different

   savannahs but little is known about how rhinos respond to burning. Our
   aim was to understand rhino responses to fire by studying habitat
   selection and foraging at multiple scales. We used resource selection
   functions and locations of 31 rhinos during 2014-2016 to study rhino
   habitat use in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Rhino selectivity was
   quantified by comparing forage consumption to plant species availability
   in randomly sampled vegetation plots; rhino diets were subsequently
   verified through DNA metabarcoding analysis of faecal samples. Rhino
   habitat use was a unimodal function of fire history, with highly
   occupied sites having fire frequencies of < 0.6 fires/year and maximum
   occupancy occurring at a fire frequency of 0.1 fires/year. Foraging
   stations had characteristic plant communities, with 17 species
   associated with rhino foraging. Rhinos were associated with, and
   disproportionately consumed, woody plants, forbs and legumes, all of
   which decreased in abundance with increasing fire frequency. In contrast
   to common management practices, multiple lines of evidence suggest that
   the current fire regime in the Serengeti negatively influences rhino
   habitat use and foraging and that frequent fire limits access of rhinos
   to preferred forage. We outline a conceptual model to guide managers and
   conservationists in the use of fire under variable habitat conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and fire management are recognized as important factors in
   biodiversity conservation. Measuring species-level demographic,
   behavioural and population responses to different fire regimes is
   essential for designing adequate management policies. Here we assessed
   the impact of fire on survival rates, reproduction and movement patterns
   in Testudo graeca, an endangered terrestrial tortoise inhabiting the
   Mediterranean region, a system in which fire plays a relevant role in
   the functioning of their ecosystems. Then we predicted the probabilities
   of quasi-extinction of T. graeca under several fire regimes and
   population sizes by means of stochastic population models. Our results
   showed that fire caused direct and delayed reductions in local survival,
   young individuals being the most affected. There were not differences in
   fecundity and movement patterns of tortoises between burned and unburned
   areas. Population models showed a strong variation in the probability of
   quasi-extinction of populations depending on the fire regime and the
   population size. Under fire frequencies similar to those occurring in
   the wild (<1 fire every 20-30 years) most tortoise populations seemed to
   buffer the effects of fires. However, when this threshold value of fire
   frequency was surpassed, the probability of quasi-extinction of
   populations exploded for all populations, except for those with the
   largest sizes. T. graeca populations may be able to cope with natural
   current fire frequencies, but the effects of more recurrent fires may
   severely threaten the species. Our results have straightforward
   applications for fire management purposes in those areas of the
   Mediterranean region where this endangered species is present. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Growing recognition that periodic fire is critical for maintaining the
   health of many rangeland ecosystems and concerns over more frequent
   catastrophic wildfires have focused attention on prescribed fire as an
   ecosystem restoration and fuel management tool. In states such as Texas,
   where most land is privately owned, the level of success of outreach
   activities aimed at expanding the adoption of specific management
   practices is influenced by the extent to which landowners' perceptions,
   interests, and concerns regarding such practices are addressed. This is
   particularly important for prescribed fire, which has been perceived by
   many landowners to be a dangerous or wasteful practice. Here we report
   the results of a mail survey of 185 members of the Edwards Plateau
   Prescribed Burn Association (EPPBA) and a random sample of 600 nonmember
   rural landowners in four counties in the Edwards Plateau and two
   counties in the Rolling Plains ecoregions of Texas. The overall response
   rate was 46.6\%. Primary reasons respondents did not apply fire on their
   land were insufficient resources, legal concerns, and lack of assistance
   with burn plan development. EPPBA members had more positive attitudes
   than nonmembers about the ecological role of fire and the use of
   prescribed fire. Our study suggests that adoption of prescribed burning
   as an integral part of land management plans by private landowners could
   be expanded by forming new prescribed burning associations. The EPPBA
   model for such associations provides learning opportunities that are
   consistent with adult learning and innovation adoption principles. It
   facilitates fire safety training, reduces concerns over legal liability
   associated with fire ignition, and enhances access to shared fire
   management equipment and labor on burn days. The two-tiered structure of
   the EPPBA with some form of state-level representation appears to be an
   efficient organizational structure for these associations.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance and environmental heterogeneity are factors that affect
   forest ecosystems under different climates. Although fire is an
   important disturbance agent in deciduous oak forests of western Iran,
   its effects on vegetation composition are still poorly understood. This
   study examined the short-term impact of different fire intensities on
   the composition and diversity of herbaceous species, together with
   physical, chemical and biological soil properties. In sampling a large
   area that had burned in 2013, we surveyed the vegetation and soil
   properties in quadrats established in each of 25 plots that had been
   selected for each of three fire intensities. Detrended correspondence
   analysis revealed greater similarity in species composition between
   low-intensity fire (LFI) and unburned (Un) areas compared to LFI versus
   high-intensity fire (HFI). Compared to Un, LFI increased richness of
   annual and perennial herbaceous species, while HFI exerted the opposite
   effect. Moreover, the number of indicator species was decreased with
   increasing fire intensity. Higher soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC)
   and nitrogen (MBN) and basal respiration (BR), as well as microbial
   quotient (qMic) were found in Un compared to burned areas; these
   variables averaged 1098 mu g g(-1), 85.4 mu gg(-1), 17.08 mg CO2-C
   kg(-1) day(-1) and 1.96 mg Cmic/g C total, respectively. Also, Shannon
   indices of herbaceous species were positively related to these microbial
   responses. Overall, soil microbial characteristics were more sensitive
   indicators of fire intensity than soil physico-chemical properties.
   These results suggest that low intensity fires could be used effectively
   as a management tool to obviate the effects of intense fires in such
   semi-arid ecosystems, thereby reducing forest floor fuel loads while
   maintaining or even improving herbaceous plant richness. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{1. Although likely to yield less copious collections than their tropical
   counterparts, temperate inventories focused on invertebrates require
   individuals not only trained to deal with a wide array of taxa but also
   versed in the techniques used to process and archive specimens.
   2. Due in part to the prevalence of physically intensive conservation
   management practices (e.g. prescribed burning) or resource management
   practices (e.g. selective logging), and in part to a better
   understanding of temperate invertebrate faunas relative to their
   tropical counterparts, temperate conservationists bear an inescapable
   responsibility for monitoring the effects of such practices on species
   assemblages of conservation concern.
   3. Counterintuitively, North American conservation programmes,
   particularly those involving monitoring, run the risk of turning away
   from concerns for invertebrate assemblages, despite their being
   relatively well-understood, recognized as powerful conservation tools or
   indicators, and in some areas the demonstrable majority of the most
   threatened of animal species.
   4. Synthesis and applications. To prevent further erosion or underuse of
   invertebrate monitoring and inventories, there is a recognizable need
   for professional space in the North American conservation community for
   parataxonomist-like individuals. These should be trained to deal with
   both the required field procedures and the standards and practices

Abstract = {{High severity forest fires are increasing in large areas of the southern
   and western United States as the climate becomes warmer and drier. Given
   their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of
   bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our
   understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However,
   because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been
   conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In
   this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact
   (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high
   severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in
   September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point
   count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1
   year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected
   individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird
   species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at
   the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase
   in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and
   winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the
   species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat
   preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping
   sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with
   burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high
   severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident
   bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat
   heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines
   ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the
   Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat
   continues to change through successional processes and post-fire
   management actions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   (post-fire resprouting) and rock cover surrounding plants were assessed

   or survived fire through protection in refugia. Plants were found to be
   tolerant of fire, sustaining only mild damage with apparent fire

Abstract = {{Logging has ecological effects on invertebrates in Fennoscandian boreal
   forest. Especially infected are species associated with micro-habitats
   of natural old-growth forest, such as coarse woody debris, large
   deciduous trees, and patches of wet swamp-forest. Furthermore, the
   effective control of forest fires has adversely, affected many species
   that require burned substrates. Although old-growth specialists tend to
   disappear from clear-cuts, local invertebrate species richness
   (alpha-diversity) may increase as forest generalists persist and
   numerous open-habitat species appear: This seems true at least for taxa
   (e.g., ground-beetles and spiders) that are not directly associated with
   the characteristic micro-habitats of old growth mentioned above.
   However, at the landscape or biogeographical scale intensive logging
   tends to homogenize forest habitats and lend to declines of sensitive
   species. Based on these findings three complementary approaches appear
   useful for the maintenance of boreal biodiversity while harvesting
   timber. (1) Undisturbed old-growth forests must be set aside to sustain
   specialist species and to serve ns sources for recolonization. (2)
   Because these reserves are not, and will probably not be, large and
   regionally representative enough, ecologically sound silvicultural
   practices must be developed using natural disturbance regimes as

Abstract = {{We have studied the ecology and conservation requirements of Banksia
   species in the species-rich sandplains of south-western Australia for 25
   years. Loss of habitat through land-clearing has had the greatest impact
   on their conservation status over the last 50 years. Ascertaining
   optimal conditions for conservation management in bushland requires
   detailed knowledge of the species under consideration, including
   demographic attributes, fire regime, growing conditions and interactions
   with other species. Where populations have been fragmented, seed
   production per plant has also fallen. The group most vulnerable to the
   vagaries of fire, disease, pests, weeds and climate change are the
   non-sprouters, rather than the resprouters, with population extinction
   so far confined to non-sprouting species. Recent short-interval fires (<
   8 years) appear to have had little impact at the landscape scale,
   possibly because they are rare and patchy. Fire intervals exceeding
   25-50 years can also lead to local extinction. Up to 200 viable seeds
   are required for parent replacement in Banksia hookeriana when growing
   conditions are poor (low post-fire rainfall, commercial flower
   harvesting) and seed banks of this size can take up to 12 years to be
   reached. Seed production is rarely limited by pollinators, but
   interannual seasonal effects and resource availability are important.
   Genetic diversity of the seed store is quickly restored to the level of
   the parents in B. hookeriana. Florivores and granivores generally reduce
   seed stores, although this varies markedly among species. In Banksia
   tricuspis, black cockatoos actually increase seed set by selectively
   destroying borers. Potential loss of populations through the root
   pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi also challenges management, especially
   in the southern sandplains. Prefire dead plants are a poor source of
   seeds for the next generation when fire does occur. Harvesting seeds and
   sowing post-fire have much to commend them for critically endangered
   species. Bare areas caused by humans can result in ideal conditions for
   plant growth and seed set. However, in the case of B. hookeriana/B.
   prionotes, disturbance by humans has fostered hybridisation, threatening
   the genetic integrity of both species, whereas fine-textured soils are
   unsuitable for colonisation or rehabilitation. Few viable seeds become
   seedlings after fire, owing to post-release granivory and herbivory and
   unsuitable germination conditions. Seedling-competitive effects ensure
   that season/intensity of fire is not critical to recruitment levels,
   except in the presence of weeds. Water availability during summer-autumn
   is critical and poses a problem for conservation management if the trend
   for declining rainfall in the region continues. Our simulation modelling
   for three banksias shows that the probability of co-occurrence is
   maximal when fire is stochastic around a mean of 13 years, and where
   fire-proneness and post-fire recruitment success vary in the landscape.
   Modelling results suggest that non-sprouting banksias could not survive
   the pre-European frequent-fire scenario suggested by the new grasstree
   technique for south-western Australia. However, we have yet to fully
   explore the conservation significance of long-distance dispersal of
   seeds, recently shown to exceed 2.5 km in B. hookeriana.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat management strategies across the globe are often focusing on
   flagship species, such as large threatened mammals. This is also true
   for most protected areas of India, where large mammals such as the Tiger
   or Asian Elephant represent focal species of conservation management,
   although a shift towards other species groups can be observed in recent
   times. Prescribed burning is a controversially debated method to manage
   open habitat types. This method is practised as a tool to manage the
   habitat of the endangered Nilgiri tahr, Nilgiritragus hylocrius (an
   endemic goat) at a large scale (50 ha grids) in Eravikulam National Park
   of the Western Ghats (Kerala, India). However, the impact of prescribed
   burning on other biota of this unique environment in a global
   biodiversity hotspot has not been studied. We compared the impact of
   large-scale prescribed burning on grasshopper abundances in Eravikulam
   National Park with small-scale burning in Parambikulam Tiger Reserve
   from 2015 to 2018, to assess the impact of the different fire management
   practices of these reserves on this species-rich insect group. We
   observed a negative response of grasshoppers to burning of larger
   contiguous areas in terms of their recovery after fire events, whereas
   burning small patches in a mosaic pattern facilitated rapid recovery of
   grasshopper communities. Our results suggest that burning management can
   be optimized to benefit both, the flagship vertebrate species as well as

   conifer communities on forest-prairie-wetland interfaces. Several other
   wildlife species also are closely tied to Oregon white oak woodlands.
   Oak woodland wildlife habitat is being reduced and fragmented by human
   development. Management of oak woodlands is necessary to protect
   ecological biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and habitat quality of
   existing oak woodlands. Specific management goals include maintaining
   large, open-form oak stands with adjacent intergrading conifers,
   prairies, and wetlands; preventing habitat fragmentation; maintaining
   open to patchy understory devoid of invasive species such as Scot's
   broom; and minimizing human disturbances that could accelerate root
   damage to oaks. Management recommendations include removing overtopping
   Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France) except
   old-growth trees; thinning dense understory oak and Douglas-fir to
   release remaining oaks; maintaining or developing habitat corridors to
   link scattered oak patches; using prescribed burning to prevent dense
   shrub competition; and promoting oak woodland conservation and
   enhancement on public and private lands through information, education,
   and legislation.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation and management of grasslands may involve the use of
   prescribed fire to reinstate a historical disturbance regime recently
   suppressed by humans. I used traps to describe the terrestrial mollusc
   community in a rare wetland prairie ecosystem of western Oregon, USA
   over a 3-year period in an adjacent burned and unburned wetland prairie
   parcel beginning 1 year following an autumn prescribed fire. Species
   richness was lower throughout the burned area for the duration of the
   study period and mollusc abundance was lower in the first postburn year,
   but steadily increased over time, surpassing the adjacent burned area by
   the third postburn year. According to Multi-response Permutation
   Procedure, the mollusc community in the adjacent burned area differed
   significantly from the unburned prairie each year since the burn,
   suggesting that fire history may structure the wetland prairie mollusc
   community. Indicator species analysis identified that Deroceras
   reticulatum and Monadenia fidelis were indicator species for unburned
   wetland prairie, while Catinella rhederi and Vertigo modesta were
   indicator species for burned habitat at the study site. Since fire
   appears to decrease wetland prairie mollusc diversity and abundance,
   prescribed burns should be conducted in accordance with refuges, to
   provide a source population for colonizing molluscs and for other
   animals with unknown responses to fire.}},

   affects fuel loads and fire behaviour}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{640-648}},
Abstract = {{Context. Fire is an important driver of species distributions globally.
   At the same time, biota also influence fire regimes. Animal activities
   that modify fuel characteristics may influence fire regimes and hence
   ecosystem function. However, apart from herbivory, animal effects on
   fuels and fire behaviour have rarely been studied.
   Aims. Weexamined the effect of nest building by malleefowl (Leipoa
   ocellata) on litter fuel loads and fire behaviour in the fire- prone,
   semiarid mallee ecosystem of south-eastern Australia. Malleefowl nests
   consist of mounds constructed by raking large amounts of leaf litter
   from the surrounding area. Mound-building activity is likely to affect
   fuel loads and potentially affect fire behaviour in this environment.
   Methods. Litter cover and mass were compared between paired mound and
   non-mound sites. Fire behaviour modelling was used to determine whether
   differences in fuel load were likely to translate into differences in
   fire behaviour. Additionally, in an area recently burnt by wildfire, the
   minimum diameter of burnt stems was compared between mound and non-mound
   sites to determine the effects of malleefowl activity on fire intensity.
   Key results. Malleefowl nesting activity reduced litter fuel loads
   around mounds. Fire behaviour modelling and post-fire minimum stem
   diameter measurements showed this led to reduced fire intensity around
   mounds, even under extreme fire weather conditions.
   Conclusions. The likelihood and intensity of fire is reduced around
   active malleefowl mounds. Malleefowl nesting contributes to more
   heterogeneous burn patterns in mallee vegetation. This in turn may
   contribute to the formation of fire refuges.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Establishing medium- to long-term trends in habitat availability for
   endangered species is important for determining the causes of historical
   population declines and for designing effective management plans. For
   some animal species, relative habitat availability can be estimated
   using time series of aerial photographs, but the limited information in
   old black-and-white images makes it challenging to estimate accurately
   at large spatial scales.
   Australia's most endangered snake, the broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus
   bungaroides, requires unshaded, exfoliated sandstone rocks for shelter.
   Using digitized aerial photographs of four sites from 1941 and 1971, and
   a Quickbird satellite image from 2006, we estimated the trend in habitat
   availability for a well-studied population of H. bungaroides in New
   South Wales. We did this using both traditional, pixel-based
   classifications and a more recently developed object-based approach.
   Both classification methods revealed substantial, monotonic decreases
   (by 24-77\%) in the percentage cover of bare rock from 1941 to 2006 at
   all sites, with concomitant (although non-monotonic) net increases in
   percentage tree-canopy cover of 3-70\%. The cover of herbaceous and
   low-shrub vegetation appeared variable and was poorly resolved in the
   classifications.
   Both classification methods yielded adequate (> 70\%) accuracy for most
   images, but the object-based classifications were consistently more
   accurate than the pixel-based classifications and performed better when
   analysing images (from 1971) with comparatively low resolution.
   Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that habitat
   availability for broad-headed snakes has decreased considerably over 65
   years due to increased shading from vegetation, and that object-based
   image analysis is a promising tool for assessing habitat trends using
   historical photographs. Multiple studies have reported woody-vegetation
   increases over multi-decadal time-scales in Australia and elsewhere, but
   few have tied these trends to habitat availability for animal species of
   concern. The phenomenon we document may therefore be quite widespread,
   and advances in remote sensing (including applications and refinements
   of the methods presented here) will be invaluable for revealing these
   trends and designing ameliorative management strategies. Management
   plans to conserve broad-headed snakes and similarly threatened species
   should include either controlled burns or regular targeted removal of
   vegetation, preferably after a rigorous comparison of the relative
   economic and biological costs and benefits of each.}},

   fumeus) populations over the long-term and through the short-term
   impacts of fire}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Context. Range contractions are often the first indicator that a species
   is in decline. However, natural population fluctuations, characteristic
   of many Australian rodents, make differentiating between natural lows
   and unsustainable declines challenging. The endangered smoky mouse
   (Pseudomys fumeus) is a prime example. Surveys have failed to detect the
   species across much of its range over the past decade, but P. fumeus is
   known to experience fluctuations in abundance and periods of low
   detectability.
   Aims. Wecompared past and current distributions of P. fumeus in the
   Victoria Range, Grampians-Gariwerd National Park (Victoria, Australia),
   to assess long-term population persistence over 40 years and short-term
   population persistence following a high-severity fire.
   Methods. To evaluate the efficacy of surveys in detecting P. fumeus, we
   conducted analyses to explicitly model detectability using historical
   (1974, 2002) and modern (2013) survey data. We also tested the
   short-term impacts of fire on the presence of P. fumeus by surveying
   burned and unburned sites 3 months prior to, and 7 to 21 months
   following, a severe wildfire.
   Key results. Our surveys detected P. fumeus at five new sites, confirmed
   presence at one historical site, and absence from two historical sites.
   The species persisted in situ through fire, and for at least 21 months
   following. Wedetected resident populations in burned and unburned wet
   drainage systems.
   Conclusions. Despite periods of low density in which the species was
   undetected, P. fumeus persisted in an 8 km radius area of the eastern
   escarpment of Victoria Range of the Grampians-Gariwerd National Park for
   at least four decades through droughts, the presence of invasive
   predators, and the short-term impacts of wildfire.
   Implications. Although P. fumeus persisted through a severe fire,
   factors influencing survival must be assessed before generalisations are
   made about the impacts of wildfire on the species. Management of P.
   fumeus should recognise that the species survives and breeds in wet
   drainage systems. Regular resurveys incorporating statistical estimates
   of detectability are necessary to identify and track distributional
   changes of threatened species, like P. fumeus, particularly in the
   context of natural, sustainable fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Post-fire predictions of forest recovery under future climate change and
   management actions are necessary for forest managers to make decisions
   about treatments. We applied the Climate-Forest Vegetation Simulator
   (Climate-FVS), a new version of a widely used forest management model,
   to compare alternative climate and management scenarios in a severely
   burned multispecies forest of Arizona, USA. The incorporation of seven
   combinations of General Circulation Models (GCM) and emissions scenarios
   altered long-term (100 years) predictions of future forest condition
   compared to a No Climate Change (NCC) scenario, which forecast a gradual
   increase to high levels of forest density and carbon stock. In contrast,
   emissions scenarios that included continued high greenhouse gas releases
   led to near-complete deforestation by 2111. GCM-emissions scenario
   combinations that were less severe reduced forest structure and carbon
   stock relative to NCC. Fuel reduction treatments that had been applied
   prior to the severe wildfire did have persistent effects, especially
   under NCC, but were overwhelmed by increasingly severe climate change.
   We tested six management strategies aimed at sustaining future forests:
   prescribed burning at 5, 10, or 20-year intervals, thinning 40\% or 60\%
   of stand basal area, and no treatment. Severe climate change led to
   deforestation under all management regimes, but important differences
   emerged under the moderate scenarios: treatments that included regular
   prescribed burning fostered low density, wildfire-resistant forests
   composed of the naturally dominant species, ponderosa pine. Non-fire
   treatments under moderate climate change were forecast to become dense
   and susceptible to severe wildfire, with a shift to dominance by
   sprouting species. Current U.S. forest management requires modeling of
   future scenarios but does not mandate consideration of climate change
   effects. However, this study showed substantial differences in model
   outputs depending on climate and management actions. Managers should
   incorporate climate change into the process of analyzing the
   environmental effects of alternative actions.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{400}},
Pages = {{353-362}},

Abstract = {{Following decades of fire suppression many oak-pine savanna ecosystems
   have shifted to close-canopied forests. Restoration of these ecosystems
   to their savanna condition is seen as a way to reduce woody species
   encroachment and dangerous fuel loads, and restore community species
   composition. The management practices to achieve these goals typically
   involve thinning and prescribed fire. We assessed how thinning to reduce
   basal area combined with frequent prescribed fire influenced small
   mammal communities and their habitat. We focused on six habitat
   variables that can influence small mammal abundance and species
   composition: stand basal area of live trees and snags, volume of coarse
   woody debris, percent ground cover, forest floor depth, and distance of
   vulnerability, a measure of understory vegetation structure and animal
   vulnerability to predators. Although savanna restoration reduced basal
   area by 80\%, there was no change in snag density or coarse woody debris
   volume. Savanna restoration significantly increased the ground cover of
   graminoids, forbs, bare ground, and down woody debris and reduced forest
   floor depth and distance of vulnerability. These habitat changes likely
   contributed to the significant differences between small mammal
   communities in restored and non-restored stands. Restoration treatments
   caused a large increase in abundance of White-footed Mouse (Peromyscus
   leucopus) and important changes in community assemblages. Least Shrew
   (Cryptotis parva), Fulvous Harvest Mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
   Eastern Harvest Mouse (R. humulis), and Hispid Cotton Rat (Sigmodon

Abstract = {{Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna is a biodiverse ecosystem native
   to the southeastern United States. Due to fire suppression and timber
   harvest, longleaf pine has declined to 3\% of its original range. The
   extant forest provides habitat for many threatened and endangered
   species, including the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides
   borealis; RCW), a cavity-nesting bird that co-evolved with
   fire-maintained forest, resulting in savanna-like old-growth forest as
   the bird's preferred habitat. Our study site, the Oakmulgee Ranger
   District of the Talladega National Forest, harbors the largest RCW
   population in Alabama and is managed with an emphasis on RCW
   conservation. The United States Forest Service (USFS) also manages the
   Oakmulgee for uses such as wildlife conservation, recreation, and timber
   harvest. Despite efforts to restore RCW habitat and install artificial
   cavities in the Oakmulgee, the number of RCW groups has not exceeded
   123, although the Recovery Plan objective is 394 groups. Our project was
   motivated by the USFS expressing interest in determining why the RCW
   population has not exceeded 123 groups. We proposed using structured
   decision making (SDM) with the USFS and other stakeholders to address
   this problem. Our goals were to explicitly define management objectives,
   build a Bayesian belief network with a model of how decision
   alternatives are believed to affect management objectives, and use a
   sensitivity analysis to determine the part of the model to which RCW
   population growth was most sensitive. Therefore, results from the
   analysis were expected to give insights into 1) ecological factors
   limiting RCW population growth, 2) how management can overcome these
   limits, plus 3) the relative expected ability of different decision
   alternatives to satisfy multiple objectives in addition to increasing
   RCW group number. We held four SDM workshops with representatives from
   the USFS, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Longleaf
   Alliance, the Birmingham Audubon Society, and local residents.
   Stakeholder objectives consisted of maximizing the following: RCW group
   number, forest health, recreational enjoyment, community economic
   health, and aesthetics. Cavity insert installation had the greatest
   probability of increasing the number of RCW groups. The number of RCW
   groups was most affected by cavity availability, adult survival,
   reproductive output, food availability, and herbaceous understory.
   Prescribed burning was most likely to meet the combination of
   stakeholder objectives, followed by midstory removal. Our findings
   suggest that cavity installation efforts may need to be increased in the
   Oakmulgee to increase RCW group number. Also it could be beneficial to
   investigate how RCWs select cavity tree locations with the goal of
   increasing the chance that RCWs use artificial cavities to form new
   groups. The Bayesian belief network provided insights into factors
   limiting RCW population growth and how management can overcome these
   limits. The Bayesian belief network also can be used to prioritize
   management methods in the Oakmulgee given stakeholder objectives and
   time constraints.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of prairies by woody species is a worldwide conservation
   concern. Fire is frequently used to inhibit this invasion. However,
   there is little documentation of the effect of fire in wetland prairies,
   which are also threatened with encroachment of woody species. The
   present study investigated wetland species responses to experimental
   burning, hand-removal of woody species, and mowing with removal of cut
   material. The possible ecological mechanisms responsible for
   individualistic responses of species, including direct mortality,
   ability to resprout, and release from competition are considered. We
   also evaluated these treatments as tools for meeting restoration
   objectives of reducing the abundance of woody species, reducing or
   preventing spread of non-native pest species, and increasing or at least
   maintaining native species' abundance. After two years of treatments
   (1994 and 1996) three patterns emerged.
   1) Woody species: Burning and hand-removal caused the greatest
   reductions in cover of woody species. Mowing with removal of cut
   material, however, did not reduce the cover of woody species compared to
   controls. As woody plant cover decreased, plant mortality increased,
   indicating that treatments influenced woody plant cover at least
   partially through mortality.
   2) Native herbaceous species: Burning significantly decreased
   inflorescence production of Deschampsia cespitosa, the dominant wetland
   prairie grass. In contrast, burning, along with mowing, significantly
   increased flowering of Juncus tenuis. Flowering and cover of all native
   graminoids combined, however, showed no significant responses to
   treatments. Burning and hand-removal significantly promoted the cover of
   native forbs as a group, with Lotus purshiana and Veronica scutellata
   showing the greatest increases. 3) Non-native herbaceous species:
   Burning and hand-removal significantly reduced the cover of non-native
   forbs as a group and particularly reduced the cover of Hypericum
   perforatum. The number of inflorescences of nonnative grasses (Holcus
   lanatus and Anthoxanthum odoratum) increased with hand-removal and
   mowing. Overall, no treatment was clearly superior in fulfilling the
   restoration objectives. Burning was effective in reducing woody cover
   and did not promote abundance of non-native herbaceous species. Burning,
   however, reduced the flowering of the key native grass, Deschampsia
   cespitosa. Hand-removal of woody species was also effective at reducing
   woody cover and promoted the abundance of some native species, but it
   sometimes increased the cover of non-native herbaceous species. Because
   mowing with removal of cut material was ineffective in reducing woody
   cover and tended to promote non-native herbaceous species, this
   treatment is not recommended as a management tool.}},

Abstract = {{Successful fire exclusion since the 1940s has contributed to shifts in

   (Quercus L.) regeneration and an increase in regeneration of
   fire-sensitive species. On ridgetop sites in Daniel Boone National
   Forest, the U.S. Forest Service is using prescribed fire to maintain
   oak-pine communities, a management practice that could also affect
   understory species composition and richness. We examined the four-year
   effects of a single, late-winter prescribed fire on understory
   vegetation and tree regeneration. There was a nonsignificant trend of
   increased species richness in burned areas, mostly due to an elevated
   number of herbaceous species. There were no significant effects of fire
   on herb and shrub cover. Higher densities of oak, yellow-poplar
   (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) seedlings in
   burned areas occurred only in the second growing season after fire.
   Total sprouting, especially of red maple and flowering dogwood (Cornus
   florida L.), was higher for two growing seasons following fire. Fire
   promoted regeneration by fire-tolerant and fire-intolerant species

Abstract = {{Long before ``government reinvention{''} became the mission of the
   Clinton administration many federal agencies had found ways to work with
   each other to accomplish day to day tasks as well as special projects.
   Cooperation was not uncommon!
   In South Carolina at the Savannah River Site, a Department of Energy
   facility, and at Fort Jackson, a Department of Defense facility, there
   are long-standing, model programs for collaboration. These programs
   demonstrate the efficiencies of interagency resource management and
   should be implemented at other federal facilities.
   The longest term of these arrangements is between the USDA Forest
   Service and the Department of Energy at the Savannah River Site. The
   original agreement, signed in 1952, charged the Forest Service with
   reforesting the mostly open 80,000 hectare site. Since 1952 the
   agreement has evolved to comprehensive natural resource management
   including erosion control, research, timber harvest, education,
   threatened and endangered species management and other activities.
   Also at the Savannah River Site the USDA Soil Conservation Service (now
   NRCS) entered into an agreement with the Department of Energy to conduct
   an inventory and prepare the soil survey. This agreement too has
   continuously evolved, and now includes responsibility for inventories,
   field assistance, erosion control, and storm water management.
   At Fort Jackson (21,000 hectares) the USDA Natural Resources
   Conservation Service and USDA Forest Service are providing daily support
   to the Army. The NRCS began working on critically eroding areas of the
   fort in 1991, and has now extended its agreement with the Army
   indefinitely. For about the same period the Forest Service has assisted
   with prescribed burning and endangered species management.
   The Departments of Energy and Defense are tapping the most experienced
   natural resource management agencies in federal government for quality
   personnel rather than developing their own.
   Both Fort Jackson and the Savannah River Site are undergoing mission
   changes and modernization. Each covers a large land base rich in natural
   resources. The potential environmental effects from day-to-day
   operations as well as modernization are substantial. Through these
   cooperative arrangements the managing agencies are able to obtain expert
   guidance for environmental controls on new projects as well as project
   design and implementation for sediment and erosion control.
   These ``on-loan{''} employees have their parent organizations to support
   them when needed. They also learn new management objectives and
   approaches from their host agency. We believe these types of
   arrangements are under-utilized; that there are many opportunities for
   further collaboration.
   This poster displays information about the history of this
   collaboration, lists some representative program and project costs, and
   displays successful project implementation.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which wildfire adversely affects spotted owls (.Stria:
   occidentalis) is a key consideration for ecosystem restoration efforts
   in seasonally dry forests of the western United States. Recently, Jones
   et al. (2016) demonstrated that the 2014 King Fire (a ``megafire{''})
   adversely affected a population of individually-marked California
   spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) monitored as part of a long-term
   demographic study in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA because
   territory occupancy declined substantially at territories burned at
   high-severity and GPS-tagged spotted owls avoided large patches of
   high-severity fire. Hanson et al. (2018) attempted to reassess changes
   in territory occupancy of the Jones et al. (2016) study population and
   claimed that occupancy declined as a result of post-fire salvage logging
   not fire per se and suggested that the avoidance of GPS-marked owls from
   areas that burned at high-severity was due to post-fire logging rather
   than a response to high-severity fire. Here, we demonstrate that Hanson
   et al. (2018) used erroneous data, inadequate statistical analyses and
   faulty inferences to reach their conclusion that the King Fire did not
   affect spotted owls and, more broadly, that large, high-severity fires
   do not pose risks to spotted owls in western North American dry forest
   ecosystems. We also provide further evidence indicating that the King
   Fire exerted a clear and significant negative effect on our marked study
   population of spotted owls. Collectively, the additional evidence
   presented here and in Jones et al. (2016) suggests that large,
   high-severity fires can pose a threat to spotted owls and that
   restoration of natural low- to mixed-severity frequent fire regimes
   would likely benefit both old-forest species and dry forest ecosystems
   in this era of climate change. Meeting these dual objectives of species
   conservation and forest restoration will be complex but it is made more
   challenging by faulty science that does not acknowledge the full range
   of wildfire effects on spotted owls.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of North American grasslands is hampered by the impact of
   invasive herbaceous species. Selective control of these plants, although
   desirable, is complicated by the shared physiology and phenology of the
   invader and the native components of the invaded plant community.
   Fortunately, there is evidence that some management practices, such as
   prescribed fire, herbicide, and mowing, can cause differential responses
   in native and invasive grassland species. However, timing of treatment
   is critical, and fire has been shown to increase rates of invasion when
   implemented during the dormant season. Bothriochloa ischaemum, an
   introduced C4 Eurasian grass is an increasing problem in grasslands,
   particularly in southern and central regions of North America. To date,
   there has been little success in effective selective control. Two
   invaded grassland sites representative of Blackland Prairie and Edwards
   Plateau ecoregions were subjected to two growing-season prescribed fire
   treatments, single and double herbicide applications, and single and
   double mowing treatments. Mowing had no effect on either B. ischaemum or
   other dominant species at either site one-year posttreatment. However,
   growing-season fire and herbicide were both effective at reducing the
   abundance of B. ischaemum, with other codominant species responding
   either negatively to herbicide or neutrally or positively to fire. The
   vulnerability of B. ischaemum to growing-season fire may be associated
   with the ecology of its native range. The negative growth response to
   growing-season fire, combined with its lower implementation costs,
   indicates that this method warrants further investigation as a selective
   management tool for other problematic species in invaded grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is critical for the conservation of rangeland ecosystems
   worldwide and many of these systems are fire dependent. Although it is
   well established that restoring fire as an ecological process can lead
   to increased biodiversity in grasslands and shrublands, the underlying
   mechanisms driving community patterns are poorly understood for fauna in
   fireprone landscapes. Much of this uncertainty stems from the paucity of
   studies that examine the effects of fire at scales relevant to organism
   life histories. We assessed the response of a nonmigratory
   ground-dwelling bird to disturbance (i.e., prescribed fire) and
   environmental stochasticity over the course of a 4-yr period, which
   spanned years of historic drought and record rainfall. Specifically, we
   investigated the nesting ecology of Northern Bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus; hereafter Bobwhite) to illuminate possible avenues by which
   individuals respond to dynamic landscape patterns during a critical
   reproductive stage (i.e., nesting) in a mixed-grass shrubland in western
   Oklahoma, USA. We found that Bobwhites exhibited extreme plasticity in
   nest substrate use among time since fire categories (TSF) and
   subsequently maintained high nest survival (e.g., 57-70\%). Bobwhites
   were opportunistic in nest substrate use among TSF categories (i.e.,
   72\% of nest sites in shrubs in 0-12 months post fire compared to 71\%
   in herbaceous vegetation in > 36 months post fire), yet nesting
   decisions were first filtered by similar structural components (i.e.,
   vertical and horizontal cover) within the vicinity of nest sites
   regardless of TSF category. Despite being a non-migratory and
   comparatively less mobile ground-nesting bird species, Bobwhites
   adjusted to dynamic vegetation mosaics on a fire-prone landscape under
   stochastic climatic conditions that culminated in stable and high nest
   survival. Broadly, our findings provide a unique depiction of organism
   response strategies to fire at scales relevant to a critical life-stage,
   a topic that has been previously understudied and poorly understood. We
   also demonstrate how doing so can better inform conservation practices
   aimed at restoring fire regimes on grassland and shrubland landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{In arid Australia, changes to historic fire regimes may now produce more
   large-scale wildfire events. The impacts of these fires on fauna
   communities are poorly known. We sought to test the impacts of fire on
   the occurrence of two arid-zone snake species, the desert death adder
   (Acanthophis pyrrhus) and monk snake (Parasuta monachus), specialist
   inhabitants of hummock grassland and mulga shrubland, respectively. We
   also examined the influence of fire on the occurrence of a habitat
   generalist, the sympatric Stimson's python (Antaresia stimsoni). Under
   an Information-Theoretic framework we modelled the occurrence of each
   species with a range of habitat variables, including fire history, using
   logistic regression. As predicted, the two habitat specialists were more
   likely to be encountered at locations that had a lower percentage of
   surrounding area burnt in the most recent wildfires (2002), while fire
   variables failed to predict the occurrence of the habitat generalist.
   Acanthophis pyrrhus, already predisposed to endangerment through a suite
   of life-history characteristics, may be at increased risk through
   accidental and deliberate burning and fragmentation of old-growth
   hummock grasslands. We stress the importance of prescribed burning and
   natural fire breaks in maintaining areas of old-growth hummock grassland

   GPS telemetry to characterise the movements of 18 possums in landscapes

   change in movement patterns in response to fire. In unburnt landscapes,
   individuals moved greater distances early and late in the night and had
   less overlap in the areas used for foraging and denning, than in
   high-severity burnt landscapes. Habitat selection was dependent on the
   spatial context of fire in the surrounding landscape. Forest recently
   burnt at high severity may provide suitable habitat for species such as
   the mountain brushtail possum, if protected from subsequent disturbance,
   such as salvage logging. However, spatial and temporal patterns of

Abstract = {{Lantana (Lantana camara L., Verbenaceae) is an invasive species of
   global interest that threatens more than 300 Australian plant and animal
   species of conservation significance. Reptiles may be at high risk due
   to their ground-dwelling habit and reliance on microhabitat structure.
   We examined the effects of lantana, and its management, on reptile
   assemblages in a wet sclerophyll forest in southeast Queensland,
   Australia. We compared reptile assemblages across four treatments: (i)
   manual clearing and herbicide application; (ii) herbicide application
   followed by prescribed burn; (iii) untreated lantana thickets; and (iv)
   wet sclerophyll forest. Plots treated with herbicide and then burned
   were structurally more diverse than manually cleared sites and supported
   a greater diversity of reptiles. No species occurred exclusively in
   untreated lantana habitats; however, these plots supported relatively
   high abundances of rare species, particularly Challenger Skinks
   (Saproscincus rosei). Lantana also had a higher species richness
   compared to manually cleared and sclerophyll forest. The use of lantana
   as habitat by a number of species highlights the need to consider the
   importance of these habitats for fauna prior to implementing management
   options. Herbicide application followed by prescribed burning appears to
   be an ideal approach to manage lantana due to the increased
   heterogeneity and regrowth of native vegetation, an option which
   supported more diverse reptile communities. Our results caution against
   the whole scale clearing of lantana from invaded areas, as these
   habitats continue to support reptile communities including threatened
   species. Nevertheless, by treating lantana with herbicide and prescribed
   fire, reptile community structure might be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in southern California support
   biologically diverse plant and animal communities. However, native plant
   and animal species within these shrubland systems are increasingly
   exposed to human-caused wildfires and an expansion of the human-wildland

   anthropogenic pressures on plant and animal communities found in these

   address this knowledge gap, we collected detection-non-detection data

   occupancy patterns following a large, human-caused wildfire (1134 km(2))

   proximity of rural homes, distance to riparian area and elevation. Gray
   fox occupancies were the highest overall, followed by striped skunk,
   coyote and bobcat. The three species considered as habitat and foraging

   addition, environmental and anthropogenic variables had weak effects on

Abstract = {{Forested ecosystems of south-eastern Australia now differ physically,
   compositionally and functionally from their condition prior to European
   settlement. Understanding these changes, and how native species and
   entire ecosystems have responded, is crucial for biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem management. Here I argue that a combination
   of limited historical information and a knowledge base biased towards
   modern ecological studies has resulted in a distorted perception of
   ecosystem condition, hindering the instigation of effective biodiversity
   conservation measures. This argument is based on recently obtained
   information about changes to the non-volant mammal community, which
   reveals relatively recent but underreported ecological changes,
   including major declines in species distribution and abundance, shifts
   in niche utilization and associated disruption of ecosystem functions.
   Ultimately, many mammal species are being denied the capacity to
   function to the extent they did historically. Following this
   re-assessment, it is evident that current forest management does not
   adequately address contemporary conservation dilemmas posed by
   detrimental ecosystem changes. This is especially salient when most of
   the factors responsible for causing changes to the mammal community are
   still active and include forest management and utilization activities.
   Therefore, additional conservation measures are essential to meet forest
   stewardship and biodiversity conservation obligations. For the health,
   functionality and sustainability of forested ecosystems, native mammal
   species must be capable of functioning to their ecological potential and
   occupy their original niche. This will be facilitated by the suppression
   of threatening processes (primarily exotic species), ensuring
   ecologically sensitive fire regimes and the reintroduction/translocation
   of missing species. The recovery or restoration of forest functionality
   based on mammal conservation should have wide-scale benefits for
   biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Fire-adapted forests in the western United States have dramatically
   departed from the natural or evolutionary environment over the past
   century because of fire suppression, logging, grazing, and other
   management practices. In particular, most southwestern ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) forests are characterized by dense stands of
   small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires
   and ensuing damage to watersheds, wildlife habitat, and communities at
   the wildland-urban interface. Restoration treatments using mechanical
   thinning and prescribed fire have become the dominant management
   paradigm in this forest type, with landscape-scale projects being
   implemented over the next 20 years. Although many studies have examined
   wildlife responses to restoration treatments, single-species information
   is difficult for managers to synthesize and incorporate into management
   decisions made at large scales. Our goal was to investigate responses of
   breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests to forest stand characteristics
   modified by restoration treatments. We sampled birds in 23 stands for 3
   years in northern Arizona, and used multi-season and multi-species
   occupancy models to determine relationships between avian occupancy and
   stand attributes affected by treatment. Increasing occupancy rates and
   species richness were associated with decreasing canopy cover,
   increasing density of mature trees, and increasing density of snags.
   Occupancy rates and species richness were negatively associated with
   quadratic mean diameter, medium-sized trees, and downed woody material.
   Associations of the avian community and individual species with
   herbaceous cover and tree clumping were less consistent. Our results
   support the implementation of forest restoration treatments for
   restoring avian community occupancy in ponderosa pine forests, and
   emulating the evolutionary environment is likely the best approach. We
   recommend reducing canopy cover via thinning, and retaining trees
   >45.7cm diameter at breast height and snags. A commonly-proposed
   diameter cap for retaining large trees after thinning (40.6cmdbh) seems
   unlikely to benefit nesting passerines, as resulting tree densities
   would remain too large. We recommend occupancy modeling as an efficient
   method for assessing wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales. (c)

Title = {{Monitoring indicates greater resilience for birds than for mammals in
   Kakadu National Park, northern Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{397-407}},
Abstract = {{Context. Aprevious study reported major declines for native mammal
   species from Kakadu National Park, over the period 2001-09. The extent
   to which this result may be symptomatic of more pervasive biodiversity
   decline was unknown.
   Aims. Our primary aim was to describe trends in the abundance of birds
   in Kakadu over the period 2001-09. We assessed whether any change in
   bird abundance was related to the arrival of invading cane toads
   (Rhinella marina), and to fire regimes.
   Methods. Birds were monitored at 136 1-ha plots in Kakadu, during the
   period 2001-04 and again in 2007-09. This program complemented sampling
   of the same plots over the same period for native mammals.
   Key results. In contrast to the decline reported for native mammals, the
   richness and total abundance of birds increased over this period, and
   far more individual bird species increased than decreased. Fire history
   in the between-sampling period had little influence on trends for
   individual species. Interpretation of the overall positive trends for
   bird species in Kakadu over this period should be tempered by
   recognition that most of the threatened bird species present in Kakadu
   were unrecorded in this monitoring program, and the two threatened
   species for which there were sufficient records to assess trends -
   partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii) and white-throated grass-wren
   (Amytornis woodwardi) - both declined significantly.
   Conclusions. The current decline of the mammal fauna in this region is
   not reflected in trends for the region's bird fauna. Some of the
   observed changes (mostly increases) in the abundance of bird species may
   be due to the arrival of cane toads, and some may be due to local or
   regional-scale climatic variation or variation in the amount of
   flowering. The present study provides no assurance about threatened bird
   species, given that most were inadequately recorded in the study
   (perhaps because their decline pre-dated the present study).
   Implications. These contrasting trends between mammals and birds
   demonstrate the need for biodiversity monitoring programs to be broadly
   based. The declines of two threatened bird species over this period
   indicate the need for more management focus for these species.}},

Abstract = {{We collected nesting data on bird use of aspen stands in the Routt and
   Medicine Bow National Forests between 1987 and 1989. We found active
   nest sites of 28 species of small nongame birds on nine study plots in
   undisturbed aspen forests. We compared logistic regression models
   predicting nest success (at least one nestling) from nest-site or
   stand-level habitat predictors. Most common species used nest sites in
   aspen trees in forest interior locations (distance to edge > 100 m),
   with dense trees (opening > 700 m away) despite no apparent positive
   correlation with use of these habitat features and nest success rates.
   Further investigation may demonstrate that these forest interior sites
   do not experience lower predation and cowbird parasitism rates than nest
   sites near openings. We recommend adaptive management experimental
   treatments, including carefully planned cutting and controlled burns,
   that should benefit most birds in western aspen forests.}},

Abstract = {{High-altitude paramo grasslands are important for their biodiversity and
   the ecosystem services that they provide to Andean people, but they are
   sensitive to disturbances, such as fire. Understanding the ecological
   impacts of disturbance is critical for the effective management of
   paramos. Indicator species studies can provide a relatively efficient
   way to gain such understanding. Puya hamata is a flagship giant rosette
   plant and has potential as an indicator of recent paramo fire history.
   To determine population size structure, mortality, recruitment and
   growth rates of Puya hamata rosettes, all Puya plants in 400 m(2) plots
   were surveyed in 2008 and again one year later. Sixteen plots were
   recorded in both years, containing exactly 1000 plants. Mortality was
   very low during this period (0.6\%). Only 27 new plants were recruited.
   Three different size distribution patterns were observed in the plots:
   (1) low plant numbers across all size ranges; (2) a single dominant peak
   in numbers at a particular size; (3) two dominant peaks in numbers at
   distinct sizes. Estimated life span of Puya hamata was 28 years based on
   growth rates, and growth rate declined beyond the size at which most
   rosettes reproduce. To investigate the impact of different fire
   intensities on Puya hamata mortality, 400 m(2) plots within a mosaic of
   unburned and burned patches of different fire intensities were surveyed
   one month after the fire. Fire mortality was low in the medium and high
   intensity plots, and fires selectively killed smaller plants rather than
   larger ones. No mortality was observed in the unburned and low intensity
   fire plots. It is proposed that Puya responds to burning with pulses of
   seedling recruitment during periods of open vegetation after fires and
   very little recruitment at other times. Therefore, surveys of Puya
   plants can reveal past fire events in their population size structure.
   The combination of sensitivity to fire at recruitment, low fire
   mortality rates afterwards, and a 28-year lifespan makes Puya hamata an
   ideal indicator species of recent fire history in paramos.}},

Title = {{Avian relationships with wildfire at two dry forest locations with
   different historical fire regimes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Wildfire is a key factor influencing bird community composition in
   western North American forests. We need to understand species and
   community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to
   effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We
   compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry
   forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses
   to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical
   fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following
   wildfire (Arizona: 1997-1999; Idaho: 2008-2010) and used multispecies
   hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn
   severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed-severity fire regimes
   characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more
   positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive
   species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also
   observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our
   prediction for the low-severity fire regime characterizing that
   location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely
   burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases
   in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In
   contrast, canopy-nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers
   exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were
   consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with
   patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed
   relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire.
   We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining
   avian diversity could differ regionally. Specifically, intensive fuels
   management may be ecologically less appropriate for promoting
   biodiversity in areas such as the Idaho location where mixed-severity
   wildfires and dense forest stands were historically more common.}},

Abstract = {{The needs and opportunities for assessing and managing risks posed by
   wildfire are identified through synthesis of natural resources agency
   and conservation group perspectives. Risk assessment is needed primarily
   to compare environmental effects of management alternatives, including
   effects on habitat for threatened and endangered species. This need for
   comparative risk assessment (CRA) is driven by policies requiring
   federal agencies to consider risks and other adverse effects, as well as
   benefits, when planning and implementing land and resource management
   projects. An active, adaptive approach to wildfire risk management is
   highly desirable. Clear objectives are needed, consistent with a
   long-term vision of what the land should look like. Effective risk
   communications can help organizations build trust with stakeholders.
   Several improvements in existing laws and policies could encourage
   comparisons of active management risks and risk-reduction benefits with
   risks of no action when fuel loads may result in uncharacteristically
   severe wildfire effects on resource values, including fish and wildlife

Title = {{Restoration applications of resource objective wildfires in western US
   forests: a status of knowledge review}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background Frequent-fire forests of the western United States have
   undergone remarkable changes in structure, composition, and function due
   to historical exclusion of naturally occurring fire. Mechanized tree
   thinning to reduce forest density and fuel loads tends to be expensive
   and cannot be effectively implemented across all lands, and there is
   increasing interest in managing naturally ignited wildfires for meeting
   forest restoration objectives. To investigate general effectiveness of
   resource objective (RO) wildfires for restoring frequent-fire and
   associated forests of the western United States, we conducted a review
   of the related peer-reviewed literature. Results Formal analysis of
   ecological responses to RO fires is relatively recent, and 21 of the 37
   papers (57\%) we reviewed were published between the years 2010 and
   2018. We found 17 studies that investigated RO fire outcomes in Sierra
   Nevada forests, while other ecoregions that were represented in the
   literature included Arizona-New Mexico Mountains, Middle Rockies-Blue
   Mountains, and the Colorado Plateau. Yosemite National Park was utilized
   in 14 of the studies we reviewed. We noted several ecoregions where
   frequent-fire forests occur, but for which published studies on RO fires
   are lacking. The main focus of research (14 studies) was related to RO
   fire effects on forest structure, and next in importance was research
   (12 studies) related to fire severity, extent, and type, with studies of
   understory vegetation responses and landscape-scale patterns or dynamics
   also prevalent. Research findings indicated that RO fires were effective
   for reducing tree density and fire behavior; however, densities often
   remained above known historical ranges of variation in several studies.
   Understory responses reported in the literature were mixed with respect
   to effects on abundance and species richness. Increases in invasive
   species abundance in areas of high burn severity were consistently
   reported. Research on landscape patterns indicated that RO fires can
   increase heterogeneity with respect to vegetation distribution.
   Conclusion RO fires can be generally effective for restoration of
   frequent-fire forests, particularly on landscapes with long histories of
   fire use and in areas of moderate burn severity. More research is needed
   to test fire outcomes against specific restoration targets, and
   additional studies are needed concerning important ecological processes
   and functions.}},

Title = {{Using an agent-based model to examine forest management outcomes in a
   fire-prone landscape in Oregon, USA}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Fire-prone landscapes present many challenges for both managers and
   policy makers in developing adaptive behaviors and institutions. We used
   a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based
   landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect
   fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership
   landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated
   existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information
   from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our
   findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have
   variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire,
   socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios
   with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire
   than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the
   wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration
   treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more
   effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in
   years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber
   production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands.
   Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell
   because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment
   targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests
   with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require
   dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of
   nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was
   somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under
   no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure
   and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus)
   was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was
   stored on this landscape without management than with management,
   despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and
   further applications of the model could be used in collaborative
   settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and
   practices for fire-prone landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{After a large crown fire in Arizona, we examined the direct and indirect
   effects of fire and herbivory (and their interaction) on the
   regeneration of aspen (Populus tremuloides) and arthropod species
   richness and abundance. We used elk exclosures covering 150 ha and other
   experiments to examine these interactions. Several major patterns
   emerged. First, in the absence of elk, there is a positive relationship
   between burn severity and the regeneration of aspens via asexual
   reproduction. Specifically, above ground biomass of aspen resprouts was
   10 times greater at sites of high burn severity than in sites of
   intermediate burn severity, and there was virtually no aspen
   regeneration without fire. Second, elk selectively browsed aspen ramets
   in high-severity burn sites two times more intensely than aspen ramets
   in intermediate-severity burn sites, largely negating the enhanced
   regeneration that would have otherwise occurred, thus resulting in three
   times greater regeneration in intermediate burn sites than in high burn
   sites. Third, fire and elk browsing had opposing impacts on an arthropod
   community composed of 33 taxa from 11 orders and 21 families. Fire
   severity alone showed no effect on arthropod richness and abundance;
   however, intermediate-severity fire and moderate levels of elk browsing
   resulted in 30\% greater richness and almost 40\% greater abundance. In
   contrast, high-severity fire and high levels of elk browsing resulted in
   69\% lower arthropod richness and 72\% lower abundance. Fourth, the
   interaction of fire intensity and selective elk browsing resulted in
   four arthropod community types where the coverall mosaic produced the
   greatest diversity. Our study demonstrates that patterns can completely
   reverse depending on the factors involved. This argues against a
   reductionist perspective and argues for studies incorporating greater
   complexity. At the very least, we need to be aware of such biases and
   consider how they may alter important decisions that affect basic
   ecological theory and management practices.}},

Abstract = {{I have analyzed presence, abundance, and patterns of coexistence of 11
   species of pond-breeding salamanders from 203 managed sites in Indiana,
   Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio. Among these include 47 long-term
   sites that have been monitored for 7-15 years. The two most abundant
   species, Ambystoma tigrinum and A. texanum, use open habitats such as
   grasslands and savanna, and are found in single species communities
   significantly more often than expected by a null model. Several other
   species were more likely to coexist with certain species in assemblages,
   and communities of four or more species occurred significantly more
   often than predicted by null models. All of the sites with four or more
   species have fishless seasonal or semi-permanent wetlands and forested
   upland habitat. Among populations with long-term data, five species
   declined at some sites and two species increased at some sites, however,
   most population dynamics were apparently stable fluctuations. The
   declining species were primarily found in mature forest upland habitat
   and typically breed in fishless seasonal wetlands, whereas the
   increasing species use open upland habitats and semi-permanent to
   permanent wetlands. Regression and General Linear Models indicate that
   the timing of prescribed burns was a significant factor in determining
   the relative abundance of pond-breeding salamander larvae. Prescribed
   burns during spring had a negative affect on the relative abundance of
   nine of the 10 species that I examined; the exception was the obligate
   aquatic salamander Siren intermedia. The forest dwelling species took a
   mean of 4.6 years for populations of these species to recover to
   pre-burn levels. Prescribed burns also negatively affected Ambystoma
   tigrinum, A. texanum, and Notophthalmus viridescens, however, their mean
   time to recover was just 1.6 years and they typically exceeded pre-burn
   abundance. Conservation management practices should avoid using frequent
   springtime prescribed burning of wetlands and surrounding upland
   habitats when pond-breeding salamanders are present.}},

Abstract = {{The Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR) is a global
   biodiversity hotspot with high plant diversity and endemism and a broad
   range of threatening processes. An outcome of this is a high proportion
   of rare and threatened plant species. Ongoing discovery and taxonomic
   description of new species, many of which are rare, increases the
   challenges for recovery of threatened species and prioritisation of
   conservation actions. Current conservation of this diverse flora is
   based on integrated and scientific evidence-based management. Here we
   present an overview of current approaches to the conservation of
   threatened flora in the SWAFR with a focus on active management through
   recovery and restoration that is integrated with targeted research. Key
   threats include disease, fragmentation, invasive weeds, altered fire
   regimes, grazing, altered hydro-ecology and climate change. We highlight
   the integrated approach to management of threats and recovery of species
   with four case studies of threatened flora recovery projects that
   illustrate the breadth of interventions ranging from In situ management
   to conservation reintroductions and restoration of threatened species
   habitats. Our review and case studies emphasise that despite the scale

Abstract = {{1. Fire is a widespread management practice used in the maintenance of

   of species in burnt areas versus areas dominated by older heath stands.
   3. We identify 10 species as indicator species for heathland in the
   pioneer stage (0-5 years old); Amara lunicollis, Bembidion lampros,
   Calathus fuscipes, Carabus problematicus, Cicindela campestris, Nebria

   for the mature stage (15-25 years old).
   4. Moisture preference and diet are identified as traits that determine

Abstract = {{After severe fires, land management authorities in Mediterranean climate
   regions often apply post-fire rehabilitation measures intended to
   minimize on-site erosion and restore vegetation cover. The aim of our
   study was to evaluate the effectiveness of log and branch barriers as
   post-fire rehabilitation treatments after a severe fire in a Pinus
   brutia Ten. forest near Thessaloniki, Greece. We based our comparisons
   on the following woody perennial plants: Anthyllis hermanniae L.,
   Asparagus acutifolius L., Cistus creticus L., Pinus brutia Ten., Quercus
   coccifera L. and Sarcopoterium spinosum ( L.) Spach. Five years after
   fire, the post-fire treatments of log and branch barriers had no
   positive effect on groundcover. On the contrary, we found more exposed
   bare soil and rocks in the south treated plots compared to the untreated
   plots. A higher number of pine seedlings was observed on the treated
   south slopes and the untreated north slope. Higher pine mortality rates
   were observed in the south slopes and especially in the untreated site.
   Pine seedling growth was not affected by post-fire treatments. The
   highest density of C. creticus seedlings was found in the southern
   untreated plot, where the highest mortality rate was also observed. The
   construction of log and branch barriers had an adverse effect on Q.
   coccifera plants and consequently on the whole burned area revegetation
   process. Our study showed that the post-fire treatments had a negative
   effect on seedling density of A. hermanniae and A. acutifolius. The
   slope orientation affected the revegetation process and it was more
   successful on the north slopes. In conclusion, our results showed that
   the construction of log and branch barriers was not effective in
   post-fire ecosystem recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Background The availability of preferred habitats determines the spatial
   and temporal distribution of herbivores in savanna ecosystems.
   Understanding habitat preference of a targeted wildlife species is
   crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Habitat
   preference of large grazers in connection to grass height and post-fire
   effect has been debated for the last century. Here, we examined the
   effects of season, grass height and burning on the habitat preference on
   Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National
   Park. Data for seasonal habitat selection were collected using both
   direct observation along established transect lines and pellet counting
   using permanently established plots. Every month, we measured grass
   height commonly preferred by Swayne's hartebeest in grassland habitat.
   Starting from the first week of burning, we recorded the abundance of
   Swayne's hartebeest in both burned and unburned grassland patches.
   Results From detected pellets, 94.3\% were recorded in the grassland
   habitat indicating that other habitat types are less used despite their
   extensive cover > 50\% of the Park. During wet and early dry seasons,
   Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat. We found
   that 85.2\% (n = 1079) and 85.3\% (n = 593) of individuals observed in
   areas with a grass height below 30 cm during wet and early-dry seasons,
   respectively; while 70.9\% (n = 2288) preferred grass height below 30 cm
   during the dry season. The density of Swayne's hartebeest in burned
   grassland area was higher than unburned grassland areas up to 150 days
   since burning. However, in unburned grassland areas, the density was
   initially low but showed increasing trend for consecutive days, reaching
   similar density with burned areas after 150 days since burning.
   Conclusion Swayne's hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat,
   particularly during wet and early-dry seasons, shortest available grass
   height in all seasons and were attracted to burned grassland areas. Our
   results suggested that fire played an important role in maintaining
   habitat quality in grassland, and that management should continue using
   controlled burning as a tool for the conservation of Swayne's
   hartebeest. However, we remain cautious of our findings given the
   paucity of information regarding other confounding factors and the
   absence of long-term data on fire disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, objectives for forests with moderate- or mixed-severity
   fire regimes are to restore successionally diverse landscapes that are
   resistant and resilient to current and future stressors. Maintaining
   native species and characteristic processes requires this successional
   diversity, but methods to achieve it are poorly explained in the
   literature. In the Inland Pacific US, large, old, early seral trees were
   a key historical feature of many young and old forest successional
   patches, especially where fires frequently occurred. Large, old trees
   are naturally fire-tolerant, but today are often threatened by dense
   understory cohorts that create fuel ladders that alter likely post-fire
   successional pathways. Reducing these understories can contribute to
   resistance by creating conditions where canopy trees will survive
   disturbances and climatic stressors; these survivors are important seed
   sources, soil protectors, and critical habitat elements. Historical
   timber harvesting has skewed tree size and age class distributions,
   created hard edges, and altered native patch sizes. Manipulating these
   altered forests to promote development of larger patches of older,
   larger, and more widely-spaced trees with diverse understories will
   increase landscape resistance to severe fires, and enhance wildlife
   habitat for underrepresented conditions.
   Closed-canopy, multi-layered patches that develop in hot, dry summer
   environments are vulnerable to droughts, and they increase landscape
   vulnerability to insect outbreaks and severe wildfires. These same
   patches provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl,
   which has benefited from increased habitat area. Regional and local
   planning will be critical for gauging risks, evaluating trade-offs, and
   restoring dynamics that can support these and other species. The goal
   will be to manage for heterogeneous landscapes that include
   variably-sized patches of (1) young, middle-aged, and old, closed canopy
   forests growing in upper montane, northerly aspect, and valley bottom
   settings, (2) a similar diversity of open-canopy, fire-tolerant patches
   growing on ridgetops, southerly aspects, and lower montane settings, and
   (3) significant montane chaparral and grassland areas. Tools to achieve
   this goal include managed wildfire, prescribed burning, and variable
   density thinning at small to large scales. Specifics on ``how much and
   where?{''} will vary according to physiographic, topographic and
   historical templates, and regulatory requirements, and be determined by
   means of a socio-ecological process. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires have increased in frequency worldwide due to global

   altered the dynamics of deadwood accumulation in forests, which can
   affect biological communities dependent on this resource. We analyzed
   the effect of high-severity fire events on saproxylic beetle
   assemblages, which specialize in using deadwood that accumulates after
   disturbances. We compared assemblages in sites severely burned in 2002
   to those in unburned sites in Chilean Araucaria-Nothofagus forests.
   Insects were collected using window-interception traps from spring 2017
   to summer 2018. Rarefaction-interpolation curves revealed a significant
   decrease in diversity as a result of fire. Permutational multivariate
   analysis of variance showed a significant effect of fire on insect
   community structure. In addition, we observed that species turnover
   contributing most, and nestedness to a lesser extent, to differences in
   ss-diversity between burned and unburned sites. Species replacement was
   associated with an increase in abundance of xylophagous (deadwood
   feeders) and a decrease in abundance of mycophagous (fungivorous)
   insects with fire. Therefore, our results suggest that fire causes a
   reduction in diversity while benefiting the abundance of xylophagous
   beetles in Araucaria-Nothofagus forests. We recommend the use of these

Abstract = {{Conservation efforts should be directed to species and areas in
   particular need. Several concepts for conservation prioritization exist.
   Following appropriate measures, we determined the World Heritage Site
   (WHS) ``Nimba Mountains{''} and its flagship-species, the Nimba toad
   (Nimbaphlynoides occidentalis), to be both ``irreplaceable{''} and
   ``vulnerable{''}. The biodiversity hotspot, Nimba Mountains, is a WHS
   ``in danger{''}. Conservation efforts are needed to ascertain the
   long-term persistence of the globally unique viviparous toad and other
   endemic species. To set the baseline for conservation management, we
   focussed on the relationships between environmental variables and the
   current and past toad distribution. With linear, generalised linear,
   generalised additive and zero inflation models we analysed the toads'
   distribution and range limits. Our results show that weather conditions
   limit the toads to higher elevations. Water impermeable geologic layers
   seem to be inevitable for adequate dry season dormancy sites, thus being
   the main factor predicting the patchy aboveground wet season
   distribution. This emphasises the importance of temporally used
   (non-breeding) environments. For conservation planning, we thus advise
   distribution models to include all habitats used by focal species. Human
   activities may further impact a species' abundance and distribution.
   Herein, we hypothesised that increased fire frequency and anthropogenic
   habitat alteration in the recent past changed overall habitat
   characteristics and thus resulted in decreasing toad numbers and an
   altered range size. Our ecological models indeed better predicted the
   past compared to the current toad range. This emphasises the importance
   to consider recent historical developments, before drawing conclusions
   from current distribution pattern in a conservation context. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper synthesizes existing information about the disturbance
   ecology of high-elevation five-needle pine ecosystems, describing
   disturbances regimes, how they are changing or are expected to change,
   and the implications for ecosystem persistence. As it provides the
   context for ecosystem conservation/restoration programs, we devote
   particular attention to wildfire and its interactions with mountain pine
   beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks and white pine
   blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch.).
   Patterns of fire disturbance and post-fire regeneration in high
   elevation five-needle pine ecosystems are highly variable over space and
   time. While stand-replacing fires predominate in some regions, mixed
   severity fire regimes that include low intensity surface fires and crown
   fire components, appear most common. Fire disturbance provides critical
   regeneration opportunities for most high-elevation five-needle pines but
   fire exclusion over the last century is having some impacts such as
   major declines of white bark pine (Pinus albicaulis Englem). Historic
   mountain pine beetle outbreaks caused episodes of mature high-elevation
   five-needle pine death over large regions. While these pines have
   adapted to this historic pattern of disturbance, global climate change
   is causing the geographic expansion of beetle outbreaks that are killing
   high-elevation pines in places with no history of major impacts.
   Expanding beetle outbreaks and exotic blister rust infections, which
   continue to intensify and spread into the southernmost geographic range
   of high-elevation five-needle pines, reduce the density of seed bearing
   trees and hasten succession. Global climate change may also generate
   more frequent severe fires. This may pose a threat to some pines and
   generate regeneration opportunities for others, provided beetle
   outbreaks and blister rust have not reduced the density of seed-bearing
   trees below critical thresholds.
   High-elevation five-needle pine ecosystem responses to disturbance are
   complex and while there is still much to learn, management efforts are
   moving forward to conserve and restorxe these critical components of
   mountain landscapes. Given the compleity and uncertainty of ecosystem
   response to disturbance, a cautious yet proactive approach to management
   will be necessary to build ecosystem resilience to future disturbances,
   whether natural or human-caused.}},

Abstract = {{Fire-maintained pine (Pinus spp.) forests, characterized by a diverse
   herbaceous layer, sparse midstory layer, and a dominant pine overstory,
   once covered approximately 30 million ha in the southeastern United
   States. Fire suppression, landscape changes, and land management changes
   have contributed to reduced suitability of many pine stands for
   fire-dependent species, including many avian species in regional
   decline. However, intensively managed loblolly pine (P. taeda) stands
   treated with prescribed fire and herbicide could help restore or
   maintain fire-dependent communities within working landscapes.
   Therefore, we investigated avian responses to combinations of prescribed
   fire and herbicide (imazapyr) treatments within a matrix of intensively
   managed pine stands in east-central Mississippi, USA. We used a
   randomized complete block design of 6 mid-rotation, thinned pine stands
   (blocks) each with 4 treatments (control, burn only, herbicide only,
   burn + herbicide) assigned to 10-ha experimental units. We applied
   imazapyr herbicide (Arsenal(Theta)) during fall 1999 and burned units
   during winter every 3 years, beginning in 2000. We conducted avian point
   counts from year pre-treatment (1999) through 9 years post-treatment
   (2000-2008) and summarized annual vegetation structure and composition.
   We used 34 of 64 observed avian species for analyses using mixed models,
   repeated measures ANCOVA. Across the 9-year post-treatment study period,
   fire and imazapyr differentially affected avian communities with our
   combination treatment (fire + imazapyr) favoring high-priority, open
   pine bird species most. However, remaining treatments (burn only,
   imazapyr only, controls) provided additional vegetation gradients for
   species preferring greater structure diversity or canopy coverage. Our
   results indicated that fire and herbicide treatments can maintain
   vegetation structure attractive to a bird community of high-conservation
   value, while concurrently meeting economic and sustainable forestry
   goals. Although primarily managed for economic gain, intensively managed
   forests can provide suitable habitat conditions for avian species of
   conservation concern helping land managers meet biodiversity objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of disturbances in forest ecosystems is

   pine-hardwood forests of the Bankhead National Forest, Alabama, USA.
   Over 4 years, we captured 719 individual lizards representing seven
   species. Lizards exhibited species-specific responses to forest
   management: eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) captures were
   positively associated with an increasing forest disturbance gradient and
   were greatest in thin with burn treatments, whereas little brown skink
   (Scincella lateral's) captures were positively associated with
   increasing liner depth and were greatest in control sites during the
   first year posttreatment. Green anole (Anolis carolinensis) captures
   increased in forest stands with concomitant increases in air
   temperature, whereas common five-lined skink (Plestiodon fasciatus)
   captures were related to coarse woody debris cover during posttreatment

Abstract = {{Fuel structural characteristics affect fire behavior including fire
   intensity, spread rate, flame structure, and duration, therefore,
   quantifying forest fuel structure has significance in understanding fire
   behavior as well as providing information for fire management activities
   (e.g., planned burns, suppression, fuel hazard assessment, and fuel
   treatment). This paper presents a method of forest fuel strata
   classification with an integration between terrestrial light detection
   and ranging (LiDAR) data and geographic information system for
   automatically assessing forest fuel structural characteristics (e.g.,
   fuel horizontal continuity and vertical arrangement). The accuracy of
   fuel description derived from terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) data was
   assessed by field measured surface fuel depth and fuel percentage covers
   at distinct vertical layers. The comparison of TLS-derived depth and
   percentage cover at surface fuel layer with the field measurements
   produced root mean square error values of 1.1 cm and 5.4\%,
   respectively. TLS-derived percentage cover explained 92\% of the
   variation in percentage cover at all fuel layers of the entire dataset.
   The outcome indicated TLS-derived fuel characteristics are strongly
   consistent with field measured values. TLS can be used to efficiently
   and consistently classify forest vertical layers to provide more precise
   information for forest fuel hazard assessment and surface fuel load
   estimation in order to assist forest fuels management and fire-related
   operational activities. It can also be beneficial for mapping forest
   habitat, wildlife conservation, and ecosystem management. (C 2016

   population processes in fire-prone ecosystems. We use a process-based
   approach to determine the best range of fire intervals for keystone
   plant species in a highly modified Mediterranean ecosystem in
   southwestern Australia where current fire regimes vary. In highly
   fragmented areas, fires are few due to limited ignitions and active
   suppression of wildfire on private land, while in highly connected
   protected areas fires are frequent and extensive. Using matrix
   population models, we predict population growth of seven Banksia species
   under different environmental conditions and patch connectivity, and
   evaluate the sensitivity of species survival to different fire
   management strategies and burning intervals. We discover that
   contrasting, complementary patterns of species life-histories with time
   since fire result in no single best fire regime. All strategies result
   in the local patch extinction of at least one species. A small number of
   burning strategies secure complementary species sets depending on
   connectivity and post-fire growing conditions. A strategy of no fire
   always leads to fewer species persisting than prescribed fire or random
   wildfire, while too-frequent or too-rare burning regimes lead to the
   possible local extinction of all species. In low landscape connectivity,
   we find a smaller range of suitable fire intervals, and strategies of
   prescribed or random burning result in a lower number of species with
   positive growth rates after 100 years on average compared with burning
   high connectivity patches. Prescribed fire may reduce or increase
   extinction risk when applied in combination with wildfire depending on
   patch connectivity. Poor growing conditions result in a significantly
   reduced number of species exhibiting positive growth rates after 100
   years of management. By exploring the consequences of managing fire, we
   are able to identify which species are likely to disappear under a given
   fire regime. Identifying the appropriate complementarity of fire
   intervals, and their species-specific as well as community-level
   consequences, is crucial to reduce local extinctions of species in
   fragmented fire-prone landscapes.}},

Title = {{The influence of prescribed fire on wild turkeys in the Southeastern
   United States: A review and synthesis}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{455}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The pine-grassland ecosystems once prevalent in the Southeastern United
   States were dependent on frequent fire events to maintain plant
   communities and avoid succession to hardwood and shrub-dominant
   communities. The use of prescribed fire has replaced naturally occurring
   fires produced from lightning strikes to maintain remaining
   pine-grassland systems, and to expand and promote restoration into
   reclaimed areas. Currently, prescribed fire is a widely accepted
   management tool promoted by both state and federal wildlife and
   land-management agencies, and is assumed to be beneficial for both game
   and non-game species. However, a comprehensive set of guidelines related
   to use of prescribed fire for promotion of wildlife is lacking for most
   species, including species whose dependence on fire is presumed to be
   critical. We reviewed available literature on prescribed fire and its
   influence on wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) in the Southeastern
   distribution of its range. We reviewed extant literature relative to
   historical use of prescribed fire for upland gamebird management, and
   focused on documented effects of fire on life-history characteristics of
   wild turkeys, including habitat selection, demography, and movement. The
   literature supported preferential use of areas burned in the previous 3
   years, with avoidance of areas lacking a recent fire history. Fire
   return intervals between 2 and 3 years were generally supported in the
   literature as optimal to reduce woody shrub encroachment and maintain an
   herbaceous understory. However, areas infrequently burned, such as
   mature hardwood forests, provide important habitat during fall and
   winter, and provide important roosting sites. Contrary to misperceptions
   among the public, growing-season fire appears to pose little direct risk
   to wild turkey nests and poults, but research on this topic is limited
   and only recently initiated. We lack a collective knowledge of the most
   appropriate spatial scale and extent of prescribed fires for wild
   turkeys, and a single set of values for these metrics that can be
   applied throughout the Southeastern U.S. Is likely to be unrealistic
   given variations in local plant communities and landscape composition.
   Non-target species should be carefully considered before implementing
   prescribed fire regimes targeted specifically towards wild turkeys, as
   such fire regimes may not be optimal for other species.}},

Abstract = {{The challenge of understanding how composite disturbances affect
   ecosystems is a central theme of modern ecology. For instance,
   anthropogenic footprints and wildfire are increasing globally, but how
   they combine remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed how a
   disturbance legacy of about 10-m-wide cutlines, cleared for seismic
   assessments of fossil fuels, affects wildfire dynamics and species
   assemblages in boreal peatland forests. One year after the Fort McMurray
   Horse River wildfire of 2016 (Alberta, Canada), we assessed differences
   in plant and butterfly assemblages across forests and cutlines, from
   unburned and severely burned peatlands. We hypothesized that, by
   reducing fire severity, cutlines could support plants and butterflies in
   the presence of a severe wildfire (the ``refuge hypothesis{''}).
   Proportion of burned duff was five times higher in burned forests
   compared to burned cutlines (53\% vs. 11\%). We found 107 plant and 46
   butterfly taxa, with species richness being, respectively, about 1.4 and
   1.7 times higher in lines than in forests, independently from wildfire.
   Models for single species demonstrated different responses to
   disturbance, including no responses (25\% of species), dominant effects
   of fire or lines (50\%), additive effects (10\%), and interactive
   effects (15\%). Cutline refuges occurred for 20\% of plant and 70\% of
   butterfly species. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that anthropogenic
   refuges from fire occur in these peatland forests, yet different
   patterns of responses confirm the complex effects occurring with
   composite disturbances. Given that cutlines dissect thousands of square
   kilometers of boreal forests in North America, further studies should
   investigate their implications on recovery trajectories of these
   forests' succession after wildfire.}},

   Landsat MESMA fraction images time series in Mediterranean forest
   ecosystems}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{112-123}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Mediterranean ecosystems are adapted to recurrent forest fires by having
   regeneration mechanisms that overcome the immediate effects of fire.
   However, the increasing frequency of fires in most European
   Mediterranean countries is challenging the natural regrowth capability
   of these ecosystems. In this context, monitoring post-fire vegetation
   recovery is a priority for forest management and soil erosion control.
   In this work, a 13-year series (1999-2011) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper
   (TM)/Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) data was used to model
   post-fire vegetation recovery as a function of burn severity and to
   quantify post-fire resilience as a measure of vegetation cover regrowth.
   We evaluated a large forest fire located in Spain that burned
   approximately 30 km(2) of Pinus pinaster Ait. in August 1998.88 field
   plots of four burn severity levels (unburned, low, moderate and high)
   were measured in the field a year after the fire. As a variable
   representative of vegetation, we chose the shade normalized green
   vegetation fraction image (SGV) obtained by applying Multiple Endmember
   Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to the original Landsat TM/ETM +
   images. The SGV values were extracted for the 88 field plots and, after
   performing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a Fisher's Least
   Significant Difference (LSD) test allowed us to estimate resilience of
   vegetation cover as the number of post-fire years exhibiting a
   statistically significant difference between burned and unburned areas.
   Next, SGV values were referenced to unburned control plots values and
   the vegetation recovery index (VRI) was defined. The evolution in time
   curve of VRI for low, moderate and highly fire affected vegetation was
   fit using trend models (specifically, an exponential trend for VRI in
   high and moderate burn severity levels; a linear trend for low burn
   severity level, Root Mean Square Error, RMSE = 0.18, 0.13, and 0.09,
   respectively). We observed that vegetation cover affected by low
   severity fire recovered to its original state after 7 years, and
   vegetation cover affected by moderate severity recovered after 13 years.
   Vegetation affected by high severity fire was estimated to recover after
   20 years. We conclude that VRI time series based on multi-temporal MESMA
   fractions from Landsat data can be considered a valuable indicator of
   the post-fire vegetation cover recovery. Its temporal evolution
   represented post-fire vegetation cover regrowth adequately and
   facilitated the estimate of vegetation cover resilience in Mediterranean
   forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the arguments against using prescribed fire to regenerate oak
   (Quercus spp.) forests is that the improvement in species composition of
   the hardwood regeneration pool is temporary and multiple burns are
   necessary to achieve and maintain oak dominance. To explore this
   concern, I re-inventoried a prescribed fire study conducted in the
   mid-1990s to determine the longevity of the effects of a single
   prescribed fire on hardwood regeneration. The initial study was
   conducted in three oak shelterwood stands in central Virginia, USA. In
   1994. each stand was divided into four treatments (spring, summer, and
   winter burns and a control) and the hardwood regeneration was
   inventoried before the fires. During the burns, fire intensity was
   measured and categorized in each regeneration sampling plot. Second-year
   postfire data showed marked differences in species mortality rates,
   depending on season-of-burn and fire intensity: oak and hickory (Carya
   spp.) regeneration dominated areas burned by medium- to high-intensity
   fire during the spring and summer while yellow-poplar (Liriodendron
   tulipifera) and red maple (Acer rubrum) seedlings dominated unburned
   areas and all areas treated with low-intensity fire regardless of
   season-of-burn. The treatments were re-inventoried in 2006 and 2007 to
   determine whether these fire effects were still present. The new data
   show that the species distributions by season-of-burn and fire intensity
   found in 1996 still existed 11 years after the treatments. The fact that
   fire effects in oak shelterwood stands can last at least a decade has
   important management implications for resource professionals interested

Abstract = {{Savanna and woodland are transitional vegetation communities that have
   largely disappeared while many early-successional bird species have
   simultaneously declined in abundance. Pine savanna and woodland are
   being restored in the Midwest through prescribed fire and tree thinning
   to create their characteristic open canopy, dense ground layer, and
   variable shrub cover. Ideally, these restoration strategies for
   vegetation should also facilitate bird conservation objectives. We
   determined daily nest survival (DSR) for 6 songbird species,
   representing both shrub-nesting and canopy-nesting species, in southern
   Missouri, USA, in 2014 and 2015. We evaluated support for hypotheses
   relating temporal, vegetation, and management factors to DSR. We
   predicted that nest survival of the 3 shrub-nesting species (Eastern
   Towhee {[}Pipilo erythrophthalmus], Yellow-breasted Chat {[}lcteria
   virens], and Prairie Warbler {[}Setophaga discolor]) would show positive
   relationships with thinning and fire, but only Yellow-breasted Chat DSR
   was positively related to tree thinning. However, pooling species into a
   shrub-nesting guild resulted in a positive relationship of nest survival
   with tree thinning and a weak relationship with fire. For
   canopy-nesters, Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus virens) and Summer Tanager
   (Piranga rubra) DSR was negatively related to mean canopy cover, and
   Pine Warbler (Setophaga pinus) DSR was weakly related to tree density by
   size class. The canopy-nesting guild had higher DSR in thinned areas
   with lower basal area and less canopy cover. Our results demonstrate
   that pine savanna-woodland restoration in Missouri is providing
   high-quality breeding habitat for both shrub-nesting and canopy-nesting
   species, some of which are species of conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{Fire exclusion has led to an unnatural accumulation and greater spatial
   continuity of organic material on the ground in many forests. This
   material serves both as potential fuel for forest fires and habitat for
   a large array of forest species. Managers must balance fuel reduction to
   reduce wildfire hazard with fuel retention targets to maintain other
   forest functions. This study reports fuel consumption and changes to
   coarse woody debris attributes with prescribed burns ignited under
   different fuel moisture conditions. Replicated early season burn, late
   season burn, and unburned control plots were established in old-growth
   mixed conifer forest in Sequoia National Park that had not experienced
   fire for more than 120 years. Early season burns were ignited during
   June 2002 when fuels were relatively moist, and late season bums were
   ignited during September/October 2001 when fuels were dry. Fuel loading
   and coarse woody debris abundance, cover, volume, and mass were
   evaluated prior to and after the burns. While both types of burns
   reduced fuel loading, early season burns consumed significantly less of
   the total dead and down organic matter than late season burns (67\%
   versus 88\%). This difference in fuel consumption between burning
   treatments was significant for most all woody fuel components evaluated,
   plus the litter and duff layers. Many logs were not entirely consumed
   therefore the number of logs was not significantly changed by fire - but
   burning did reduce log length, cover, volume, and mass. Log cover,
   volume, and mass were reduced to a lesser extent by early season burns
   than late season burns, as a result of higher wood moisture levels.
   Early season burns also spread over less of the ground surface within
   the burn perimeter (73\%) than late season burns (88\%), and were
   significantly patchier. Organic material remaining after a fire can dam
   sediments and reduce erosion, while unburned patches may help mitigate
   the impact of fire on fire-sensitive species by creating refugia from
   which these species can recolonize burned areas. Early season burns may
   be an effective means of moderating potential ecosystem damage when
   treating heavy and/or continuous fuels resulting from long periods of
   fire exclusion, if burning during this season is not detrimental to
   other forest functions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Does the development of Brachystegia-Julber-nardia (miombo)
   woodland after felling, and under a variable fire regime. occur via a
   seral stage of fire-tolerant species?
   Location: Four sites in central Zambia, Africa.
   Methods: Trees in replicate plots were clear-cut and stumps and
   resprouts enumerated. Species recruited into the tree layer (> 2.0 m
   tall) were monitored for 11 years (1991 - 2001) and fire occurrence and
   herbaceous biomass assessed annually to determine fuel loads.
   Results: Fire frequency was variable at the study sites and fuel loads
   were generally too low to suppress woodland regeneration after felling.
   However, at one site a change from low to high fire frequency arrested
   woodland development and triggered a regression towards a `fire-trap'
   vegetation type in which a few fire-tolerant species survived. There was
   no evidence to support the hypothesis that miombo woodland regeneration
   is facilitated by a sere of fire-tolerant species. All regrowth after
   felling was from resprouting plants present before felling. Trees with a
   previous history of felling sprouted more vigorouslv than trees that had
   not been felled before. Species richness ill the tree layer increased
   with time since felling because resprout species had different height
   growth rates.
   Conclusion: The resilience of miombo trees after clear-felling is
   largely due to their capacity to regenerate vegetatively from resprouts
   and stumps after release from frequent fires. Coppicing is therefore
   recommended as a suitable management technique for miombo, woodland in
   central southern Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation structure is an integral component of avian habitat
   selection. Therefore, structure changes caused by management practices
   can influence avian communities. The salt marshes of the pampas region
   of Argentina have experienced an increase in fire use as a management
   tool to improve cattle forage and to avoid accidental fires. A spring
   burn of 200 ha of salt marsh in Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve,
   Argentina, in September 1995, allowed us to compare the response of
   birds associated with two vegetation communities, one dominated by
   Spartina densiflora (Spartina marsh) and another dominated by Juncus
   acutus (Juncus marsh) from one month to one year post-burn. We recorded
   changes in plant species composition and vegetation structure (height
   and cover) at 40 days after the burn and every season for the subsequent
   year. Fire reduced total cover of both plant communities. Juncus marsh
   recovered pre-burn structure and bird community by one year post-fire.
   However, Spartina marsh recovery was incomplete in that period. Relative
   abundances of bird species that used unburned Juncus marsh were similar
   to those in burned Juncus marsh in the spring period one year after the
   burn. Plant height at the burned Spartina marsh did not reach that of
   the unburned Spartina in 12 months; red-capped wren-spinetail
   (Spartonoica maluroides), a rare tall-grass-dependent species, settled
   burned parcels at lower relative abundances than in unburned habitat.
   Because species that first use the burned patches are very common and
   widespread in other habitats, and excessive burning may reduce available
   habitat for endangered or rare species, prescribed burns should be
   avoided in this region.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly recognized that successful biodiversity conservation
   will necessitate active ecological restoration measures. In boreal
   forests, emulating natural disturbances is commonly used as a
   restoration tool for improving habitat quality for a range of sensitive
   species. We assessed the consequences of prescribed burning and
   artificial gap creation on the demographic parameters of an
   insectivorous bird, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). This to
   improve our ability to develop strategies for successful ecological
   restoration aiming at improving the conservation status of boreal forest
   birds. Pied flycatchers reproduced equally well in nature reserves,
   forests subjected to ecological restoration and untreated control
   stands. Nestling body weight was found to be higher in stands restored
   through prescribed burning. Considering that nestling condition at the
   time of fledging is known to be positively related to survival rates
   after fledging, our results suggest a positive effect of prescribed
   burning on population dynamics and on local habitat quality. Our
   findings should encourage forest managers to actively use prescribed
   burning as a management tool in boreal forests to complement other
   conservation measures. However, one should be careful with generalizing
   these results to other bird species as they only are directly applicable
   to pied flycatchers. Still, they may potentially apply also to other
   insectivorous bird species with similar habitat requirements. In
   addition, it should be stressed that to maintain diverse boreal forest
   bird assemblages, heterogeneous landscapes are needed including both
   burned and unburned forest of different successional stages.}},

Abstract = {{Catastrophic events such as intensive wildfires have a major effect on
   the dynamics of some wildlife populations. In this investigation, the
   computer package ALEX (Analysis of the Likelihood of EXtinction), was
   used to simulate the impacts of wildfires on the persistence of
   metapopulations of the endangered species Leadbeater's possum
   (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) which is restricted to the montane ash
   forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria. A range of scenarios was
   examined. First, the response of G. leadbeateri to fires in hypothetical
   patches of old growth forest of varying size was modelled.
   Metapopulation dynamics were then modelled in four existing forest
   management areas: the O'Shannassy Water Catchment and the Steavenson,
   Ada and Murrindindi Forest Blocks using GIS-derived forest inventory
   data on complex spatial arrangements of potentially suitable old growth
   habitat patches. The impacts of different fire frequencies and the
   proportion of forest area that was burnt in the Steavenson Forest Block
   and the O'Shannassy Water Catchment were examined. Finally, the combined
   impacts of both wildfires and post-fire salvage logging operations on
   the persistence of populations of G. leadbeateri were assessed.
   Our analyses indicated that, even in the absence of wildfires,
   populations of G. leadbeateri are very susceptible to extinction within
   single isolated habitat patches of 20 ha or less. The probability of
   persistence approached 100\% in patches of 250 ha. The incorporation of
   the effects of wildfire was predicted to have a major negative impact on
   isolated populations of G. leadbeateri. In these cases, the probability
   of population extinction remained above 60\%, even when a single patch
   of 1200 ha of old growth forest was modelled.

   of G. leadbeateri in the O'Shannassy Water Catchment where very large
   patches of old growth forest presently exist. The risk of extinction of
   the species was significantly higher in the Murrindindi and Ada Forest
   Blocks where there are lower total areas of, and significantly smaller,
   suitable habitat patches. Wildfires resulted in an increase in the
   predicted probability of metapopulation extinction in the four areas
   that were targeted for study.
   An investigation of the Steavenson Forest Block and the O'Shannassy
   Water Catchment revealed that the predicted values for the probability
   of extinction were sensitive to inter-relationships between the
   frequency of fires and the proportion of habitat patches that were burnt
   during a given fire event. The probability of extinction of G.
   leadbeateri was predicted to be lowest when there were frequent fires
   that burnt only relatively small areas of a given forest block.
   Conversely, the results of our analyses suggested that populations of
   the species are vulnerable to infrequent but intensive conflagrations
   that burnt a large proportion of the forest.
   The results of the suite of analyses completed in this study suggest
   that four management strategies will be important for the long-term
   conservation of G. leadbeateri. (1) Attempts to suppress wildfires
   should be maintained as even the largest remaining areas of old growth
   forest may be susceptible to being burnt by repeated widespread
   wildfires that could result in localised and/or global extinction of the
   species. (2) Because the probability of population persistence is
   greatest in those areas that support more extensive stands of old growth
   forest, it will be important to grow relatively large patches of
   existing regrowth forest (over 50 ha) through to ecological maturity.
   This will be particularly important in some wood production forest
   blocks where there are only limited areas of old growth forest. (3)
   Patches that are set aside for the conservation of G. leadbeateri should
   be spatially separated to minimise the risk that all of the reserved
   areas in a region are destroyed in a single major fire event. (4)
   Salvage logging operations should be excluded from stands of old growth
   forest and reserved areas that are burnt in a wildfire. This is because
   such activities can have a major negative impact of the development of
   suitable habitat for G. leadbeateri.}},

Title = {{Post-Fire Resprouting in New Zealand Woody Vegetation: Implications for
   Restoration}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Resprouting is an important trait that allows plants to persist after
   fire and is considered a key functional trait in woody plants. While
   resprouting is well documented in fire-prone biomes, information is
   scarce in non-fire-prone ecosystems, such as New Zealand (NZ) forests.
   Our objective was to investigate patterns of post-fire resprouting in NZ
   by identifying the ability of species to resprout and quantifying the
   resprouting rates within the local plant community. Fire occurrence is
   likely to increase in NZ as a consequence of climate change, and this
   investigation addresses an important knowledge gap needed for planning
   restoration actions in fire-susceptible regions. The study was conducted
   in two phases: (1) A detailed review of the resprouting ability of the
   NZ woody flora, and (2) a field study where the post-fire responses of
   plants were quantified. The field study was undertaken in the eastern
   South Island, where woody plants (>5 cm diameter at 30 cm height) were
   sampled in 10 plots (10x10 m), five- and 10-months post-fire. The
   research synthesized the resprouting ability of 73 woody species and is
   the first to provide extensive quantitative data on resprouting in NZ.
   Most of the canopy dominant species were non-resprouters, but many
   smaller trees and shrubs were capable of resprouting, despite their
   evolution in an environment with low fire frequency. Species composition
   and abundance were important predictors of resprouting patterns among
   plots, with similar communities resulting in similar resprouting
   responses. Resprouting capacity provides species with a competitive
   advantage in the post-fire recovery. We suggest that it is possible to
   engineer more fire resilient restoration plantings by planting higher
   proportions of the resprouters identified in this study. The
   incorporation of resprouting as a trait in restoration plans is likely
   to be relevant not just in NZ, but also in other non-fire-prone regions
   facing increases in fire frequency.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a key process in eucalypt communities, exerting a strong
   influence on the composition, structure and functioning of forests. Much
   of the research on the fire response of temperate, wet-sclerophyll trees
   in Australia comes from Victoria, where the dominant eucalypt is
   Eucalyptus regnans. In contrast, central and northern Tasmanian forests,
   dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis, are relatively understudied. There
   is a need to determine whether Tasmanian wet-sclerophyll forests, though
   the same forest type in name, are functionally different in floristics
   and response to fire. Here we document the forest community response to
   a natural wildfire event in Tasmania-using opportunistic before/after
   control/impact (BACI) data from pre-existing monitoring plots. Uniting
   pre- and post-fire floristic data, we quantified mortality and
   regeneration of eucalypt, acacia and other dominant tree species, and
   tree ferns, Dicksonia antarctica, in response to wildfire. We also
   evaluated the density of eucalypt and acacia seedling establishment
   between burnt and unburnt forests, and quantified faunal responses to
   fire. Despite moderate-to-high intensity burning in patches across the
   plot, mortality of eucalypts, acacias and tree ferns due to fire were
   low. By contrast, fire-sensitive rainforest species showed low survival,
   though were able to persist in unburnt refugia. Eucalypt and acacia
   seedling regeneration was high in the burnt plot, suggesting that E.
   delegatensis forests regenerate without stand-replacing fire events.
   This contrasts to Victorian E. regnans forests, whose persistence is
   dependent on high-severity stand-replacing events. We also found some
   group-specific avifaunal and invertebrate responses to the fire event,
   which are broadly reflective of responses documented in other
   Victorian-based studies. Our results have implications for Tasmanian
   wet-forest silvicultural practices, which are based on the principle of
   stand-replacement after fire. The broader relevance of this work to
   forest ecology is in demonstrating the serendipitous opportunities that
   can arise with baseline monitoring plots.}},

Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{128-148}},
Abstract = {{Impact of fire on California shrublands has been well studied but nearly
   all of this work has focused on plant communities. Impact on and
   recovery of the chaparral fauna has received only scattered attention;
   this paper synthesizes what is known in this regard for the diversity of
   animal taxa associated with California shrublands and outlines the
   primary differences between plant and animal responses to fire. We
   evaluated the primary faunal modes of resisting fire effects in three
   categories: 1) endogenous survival in a diapause or diapause-like stage,
   2) sheltering in place within unburned refugia, or 3) fleeing and
   recolonizing. Utilizing these patterns in chaparral and sage scrub, as
   well as some studies on animals in other mediterranean-climate
   ecosystems, we derived generalizations about how plants and animals
   differ in their responses to fire impacts and their postfire recovery.
   One consequence of these differences is that variation in fire behavior
   has a much greater potential to affect animals than plants. For example,
   plants recover from fire endogenously from soil-stored seeds and
   resprouts, so fire size plays a limited role in determining recovery
   patterns. However, animals that depend on recolonization of burned sites
   from metapopulations may be greatly affected by fire size. Animal
   recolonization may also be greatly affected by regional land use
   patterns that affect colonization corridors, whereas such regional
   factors play a minimal role in plant community recovery. Fire
   characteristics such as rate of spread and fire intensity do not appear
   to play an important role in determining patterns of chaparral and sage
   scrub plant recovery after fire. However, these fire behavior
   characteristics may have a profound role in determining survivorship of
   some animal populations as slow-moving, smoldering combustion may limit
   survivorship of animals in burrows, whereas fast-moving, high intensity
   fires may affect survivorship of animals in aboveground refugia or those
   attempting to flee. Thus, fire regime characteristics may have a much
   greater effect on postfire recovery of animal communities than plant
   communities in these shrubland ecosystems.}},

   the southern brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus obesulus, to
   low-intensity prescribed fire in heathland vegetation}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{731-744}},
Abstract = {{Context. Prescribed burning is routinely performed within the Sydney
   Basin as a method of fire-hazard mitigation. Despite the widespread use
   of prescribed fire, knowledge of the impact of prescribed fire on most
   fauna species remains unclear. This is particularly the case for
   bandicoot species.
   Aims. To determine the impact of a low-intensity prescribed fire on the
   survival of the long-nosed bandicoot, Perameles nasuta, and the southern
   brown bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus obesulus (hereafter abbreviated to I.
   obesulus), immediately after the fire and at 5 weeks, 5 months and 13
   months following the fire. To document the spatial ecology and nesting
   requirements of I. obesulus and P. nasuta before and after fire.
   Methods. One I. obesulus and seven P. nasuta (five female and two male)
   individuals were radio-tracked. Animals were tracked before, during and
   following a hazard-reduction burn to assess the impact of fire on home
   range, survival and nesting behaviour.
   Key results. Post-fire survival of P. nasuta and I. obesulus was high
   and the population remained stable up to 5 months following the fire.
   All animals tracked within the burn area (three female P. nasuta)
   survived the passage of fire. The home range for one male I. obesulus
   was found to be 2.35 ha 50\% kernel-density estimate (KDE) and 12.35 ha
   95\% KDE. Female P. nasuta (n = 5) had a home range of 1.3 ha +/- 0.2
   s.e. 50\% KDE and 7.5 ha +/- 1.7 s.e. 95\% KDE. Male P. nasuta (n = 1)
   had a home range of 1.1 ha 50\% KDE and 6.5 ha 95\% KDE. Nesting for
   both species tended to occur in dense vegetation, with a slight shift to
   non-combustible refuge sites post-fire. Animals tended to maintain
   exclusive and relatively stable core home ranges, although overlap of
   non-core home ranges was common.
   Conclusions. The survival of bandicoots following a low-intensity
   hazard-reduction fire was high in the short term; however, further
   research is required to determine how the components of a fire regime
   affect native species, in particular peramelids.
   Implications. Hazard-reduction fires should be used with caution to
   manage the isolated and endangered northern Sydney population of I.
   obesulus, so as to ensure the persistence of this species.}},

   winter precipitation across a regional climate gradient}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{455}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Altered climate and changing fire regimes are synergistically impacting
   forest communities globally, resulting in deviations from historical
   norms and creation of novel successional dynamics. These changes are
   particularly important when considering the stability of a keystone
   species such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), which
   contributes critical ecosystem services across its broad North American
   range. As a relatively drought intolerant species, projected changes of
   altered precipitation timing, amount, and type (e.g. snow or rain) may
   influence aspen response to fire, especially in moisture-limited and
   winter precipitation-dominated portions of its range. Aspen is generally
   considered an early-seral species that benefits from fire, but increases
   in fire activity across much of the western United States could affect
   the species in unpredictable ways. This study examined post-fire aspen
   stands across a regional climate gradient spanning from the
   north-central Great Basin to the northeastern portion of the Greater
   Yellowstone Ecosystem (USA). We investigated the influence of seasonal
   precipitation and temperature variables, snowpack, and site conditions
   (e.g. browsing levels, topography) on density of post-fire aspen
   regeneration (i.e. all small trees ha(-1)) and recruitment (i.e. small
   trees >= 2 m tall ha(-1)) across 15 fires that occurred between 2000 and
   2009. The range of post-fire regeneration (2500-71,600 small trees
   ha(-1)) and recruitment (0-32,500 small trees >= 2 m ha(-1)) densities
   varied widely across plots. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated
   that both response variables increased primarily with early winter
   (Oct-Dec) precipitation during the `fire-regen period' (i.e., fire year
   and five years after fire) relative to the 30-year mean. The 30-year
   mean of early winter precipitation and fire-regen period snowpack were
   also positively related to recruitment densities. Both response
   variables decreased with higher shrub cover, highlighting the importance
   of considering shrub competition in post-fire environments. Regeneration
   and recruitment densities were negatively related to proportion browsed
   aspen leaders and animal pellet densities (no./m(2)), respectively,
   indicating the influence of ungulate browsing even at the relatively low
   levels observed across sites. A post-hoc exploratory analysis suggests
   that deviation in early winter precipitation during the fire-regen
   period (relative to 30-year means) varied among sites along directional
   gradients, emphasizing the need to consider multiple spatiotemporal
   scales when investigating climate effects on post-fire successional
   dynamics. We discuss our findings in terms of dynamic management and
   conservation strategies in light of changing fire regimes and climate
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies require a clear understanding of the processes of
   dormancy release and germination. In fire-prone environments, implying
   that seeds are dormant because of a lack of germination from a
   soil-stored seed bank can confound results of experiments aimed at
   identifying dormancy mechanisms of fresh seeds. In this study, dormancy
   classification is endorsed as a starting point for establishing
   mechanisms that control dormancy of species from fire-prone vegetation.
   Shrub species within the physical dormancy (PY), physiological dormancy
   (PD), morphological dormancy (MD) and morphophysiological dormancy (MPD)
   classes were found to occur in the south-eastern Australian region in
   proportions similar to that of other fire-prone regions. Seasonal
   temperatures, not fire cues, are the main factors that break
   physiologically related dormancy mechanisms and can also control the
   timing of germination. Seasonal emergence patterns are more likely for
   species with a PD component than for those with PY. This can delay
   seedling emergence depending on the timing of the fire event,
   particularly in regions without a distinct rainfall season, and
   potentially hinder recruitment. Species with MPD and PD may therefore be
   more sensitive to seasonal shifts in the fire regime, and this could
   have implications for community species composition and threatened
   species management.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Wildfires in dry forest ecosystems in western North America are
   producing fire effects that are more severe than historical estimates,
   raising concerns about the resilience of these landscapes to
   contemporary disturbances. Despite increasing fire activity, relatively
   little is known about the structure and composition of fire refugia -
   unburned or low-severity burned patches where trees survived fire - or
   the degree to which their understory composition differs from
   fire-generated early-seral forests. Locations Four recent large fires in
   dry mixed-conifer forest in eastern Oregon, USA. Methods We sampled
   vegetation and environmental factors in 187 plots (100-m(2)) in fire
   refugia (n = 52) and stand-replacement patches (SRPs) (n = 135). We used
   non-metric multidimensional scaling, indicator species analysis, and
   randomization tests to compare understory plant communities and
   diversity in fire refugia and SRPs 12-17 years post-fire. Results
   Understory plant communities in fire refugia and SRPs showed strong
   compositional affinities, but exhibited shifts in reproductive trait
   prevalence and differences in landscape-scale species richness. There
   were no differences in plot-scale species richness or the occurrence of
   two prominent invasive annual grasses (Bromus tectorum, Ventenata
   dubia). The abundance of common obligate seeding species was similar
   between plot types, but resprouting and seed-banking species became
   substantially more abundant in SRPs. Significantly more plant species
   occurred only in fire refugia, and significantly fewer in SRPs, than
   expected by chance. Conclusions Similarities in understory plant
   communities between fire refugia and early-seral forest in SRPs provide
   evidence for the resilience of historically frequent-fire forest
   understory communities to contemporary fire effects. However, fire
   refugia may serve an ecologically important role as patches with
   relatively intact forest structure, seed sources that contribute to
   post-fire forest recovery, and as reservoirs of species and age
   structure that may be absent from the higher-severity burned matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife species of conservation concern can present forest managers
   with a particular challenge when habitat needs appear to be in contrast
   with other management objectives, particularly fuel reduction to reduce
   wildfire risk. Proposed actions can be opposed by stakeholders, delaying
   management activities until a resolution is met. In the southwestern
   USA, the primary goal of forest management is to reduce the risk of
   severe wildfire through forest restoration treatments. The USDA Forest
   Service has designated the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) a
   management indicator species in this region. However, it has been
   difficult to achieve a common understanding of goshawk habitat needs
   among forest stakeholders. We combined two separate and complementary
   modeling approaches - a statistically based occurrence model and
   alternative forest treatment models - to yield predictions about forest
   management effects on the goshawk in ponderosa pine-dominated forests
   (Pinus ponderosa) on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona. Forest treatment
   models were developed based on USDA Forest Service recommendations for
   goshawk habitat and post-treatment data from ecological restoration
   experiments, both of which were also components of forest treatment
   guidance from the Kaibab Forest Health Focus collaborative planning
   effort. All treatment alternatives resulted in a 22-26\% reduction in
   estimated goshawk occurrence, but the declines were not uniform across
   the study area, varied by forest type, and were not as large as the
   effects of recent and severe wildfire (44\% reduction in occurrence).
   Considering the controversial history of forest management with respect
   to the goshawk, it is prudent to interpret results from this study in
   the context of tradeoffs between wildfire risk reduction and wildlife
   habitat quality that can be effectively evaluated through science-based
   collaborative assessment and planning. While developed for a specific,
   high-profile species in the southwestern USA, the approach is applicable
   to many other species whose occurrence has been monitored over multiple
   years. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have investigated the response of small mammal
   populations to fire, but few have investigated behavioural responses to
   habitat modification. In this Study we investigated the impact of fire
   on home range, habitat use and activity patterns of the short-snouted
   elephant shrew (Elephantulus brachyrhynchus) by radio-tracking
   individuals before and after a fire event. All animals survived the
   passage of fire in termite mound refugia. Before the fire, grassland was
   used more than thickets, but habitat utilization shifted to thickets
   after fire had removed the grass cover. Thickets were an important
   refuge both pre- and post-fire, but the proportion of thicket within the
   home range was greater post-fire. We conclude that fire-induced habitat
   modification resulted in a restriction of E. brachyrhynchus movements to
   patches of unburned vegetation. This may be a behavioural response to an
   increase in predation pressure associated with a reduction in cover,
   rather than a lack of food. This study highlights the importance of
   considering the landscape mosaic in fire management and allowing

Abstract = {{Preservation of biodiversity is a central goal of conservation
   management, yet the conditions that promote persistence may differ for
   the species in the community. For systems subject to stochastic
   disturbances such as fire, understanding which management practices
   promote persistence for all species in a community is complex. Before
   deciding on the best course of action, an objective must be specified.
   Yet an overarching goal of species persistence can be specified into a
   measureable objective many different ways. We investigated four
   alternative management objectives for maximizing species persistence
   that use common biodiversity indices: (1) attaining the minimally
   acceptable mix of successional vegetation states to support species'
   relative abundances, (2) maximizing the arithmetic mean abundance of
   species, (3) maximizing the geometric mean abundance of species, and (4)
   minimizing the average extinction risk of species. We used stochastic
   dynamic programming to model successional changes in vegetation in the
   presence of both planned and unplanned fires, and utilize an extensive
   data set on the occurrence of birds, reptiles, and small mammals in
   different successional states in semiarid Australia. We investigated the
   influence the choice of objective function and taxonomic focus has on
   the optimal fire management recommendations. We also evaluated a recent
   hazard reduction policy to annually burn a fixed amount of the landscape
   and compare results to the optimal solution. The optimal management
   strategy to maximize species persistence over a 100-year period is
   predominantly to minimize wildfires. This is because the majority of
   species are more likely to occur in intermediate and late successional
   vegetation. However the optimal solution showed sensitivity to the
   objective and the species included in the analysis. These results
   highlight the need for careful consideration when specifying an
   objective to represent overarching conservation goals. Using the
   extinction risk objective, we show that a policy to annually burn 5\% of
   the landscape could increase the average probability of extinction for
   the modelled species by 7\% over the next 100 years compared to the
   optimal management scenario.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to restore and maintain oak savannas in North America, with
   emphasis on the use of prescribed fire, have become common. Little is
   known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations,
   especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community
   structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained
   by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13
   sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird
   species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected
   by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The
   species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern
   Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura),
   Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings (
   Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more
   common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla)
   and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to
   one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak
   savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates
   of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13
   species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna
   habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and
   habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on
   breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that
   restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of
   constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications
   regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in
   fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly
   function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if
   they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Translocation of species to areas of former habitat after threats have
   been mitigated is a common conservation action. However, the long-term
   success of reintroduction relies on identification of currently
   available habitat and areas that will remain, or become, habitat in the
   future. Commonly, a short-term view is taken, focusing on obvious and
   assumed threats such as predators and habitat degradation. However, in
   areas subject to significant climate change, challenges include
   correctly identifying variables that define habitat, and considering
   probable changes over time. This poses challenges with species such as
   the western ground parrot Pezoporus flaviventris, which was once
   relatively common in near-coastal south-western Australia, an area
   subject to major climate change. This species has declined to one small
   population, estimated to comprise < 150 individuals. Reasons for the
   decline include altered fire regimes, introduced predators and habitat
   clearing. The establishment of new populations is a high priority, but
   the extent to which a rapidly changing climate has affected, and will
   continue to affect, this species remains largely conjecture, and
   understanding probable climate change impacts is essential to the
   prioritization of potential reintroduction sites. We developed
   high-resolution species distribution models and used these to
   investigate climate change impacts on current and historical
   distributions, and identify locations that will remain, or become,
   bioclimatically suitable habitat in the future. This information has
   been given to an expert panel to identify and prioritize areas suitable

Abstract = {{The restoration of tallgrass prairies is often centered on
   reestablishing plants, with only minor efforts directed to the fauna
   that inhabit these areas. Small mammals play important ecological roles
   in many ecosystems, so understanding how management techniques such as
   the reintroduction of bison (Bison bison) and prescribed fire affect
   them can assist in a more comprehensive evaluation of restoration
   efforts in sites being actively restored. Our objective was to assess
   impacts of reintroduced bison and prescribed fire in restored prairies
   on small mammals in the first two years of bison presence. Small mammal
   abundance decreased with restoration age and time since fire. Small
   mammal diversity increased with restoration age and was slightly lower
   in sites where bison were present. Differences in diversity were driven
   primarily by prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), and abundance was
   driven by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). The mechanism for these
   impacts is likely habitat availability: fires remove litter and residual
   dead vegetation, which are important habitat for voles. The removal of
   litter and residual dead vegetation with fire usually results in a
   higher amount of bare ground being exposed relative to pre-fire
   conditions. Although bison impacts may continue to change over time as
   grazing effects accrue, we demonstrate relatively weak effects of this
   megaherbivore on small mammal communities. Our results underscore that
   utilizing bison reintroductions and prescribed fire in concert and
   employing them to maximize habitat heterogeneity is likely to best
   maintain small mammal diversity across restored prairies.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly frequent ``megafires{''} in North America's dry forests

   higher after the fire (0.88) than before the fire (0.12) at severely

Abstract = {{The U.S. Forest Service plans to restore >40,000 ha of the

   endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Concern has
   arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests
   to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach
   to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small
   mammals. During 2 winters wee compared small mammal occurrence and
   abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife
   stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and With WSI-treated stands
   in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed
   fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was
   a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire.
   Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this
   study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was
   adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced
   midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous
   production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance,
   richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed
   mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse {[}P. leucopus])
   were the dominant species, accounting for 68\% of the 611 individuals

Title = {{Succession after prescribed burning in coastal Calluna heathlands along
   a 340-km latitudinal gradient}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   The coastal heathlands of northwest Europe are classified as highly
   endangered and a habitat of high conservation importance throughout
   their geographic range. Previous research into heathland vegetation
   dynamics has typically been carried out within single sites or regions,
   and hence little is known about the variability of land-use effects and
   successional dynamics along biogeographic gradients. We test the
   hypothesis that the bioclimatic gradient is a key factor shaping
   post-fire regeneration dynamics in Calluna heathlands, with
   progressively slower regrowth and lower post-fire pioneer species
   richness towards colder climates.
   Location
   Wet and dry Calluna heath vegetation in five sites spanning a 340-km
   latitudinal gradient along the west coast of Norway (60.70 degrees-63.79
   degrees N).
   Methods
   A repeated measures design was used, with floristic data recorded from
   permanent plots in a number of experimental post-fire successionsover a
   3-yr period (n=344). The data were analysed using multivariate
   ordination techniques: detrended correspondence analysis, partial
   redundancy analysis and principal response curves, and mixed effects
   models.
   Results
   Regeneration rates decrease from south to north and the wet heath stands
   regenerate faster towards the pre-fire community composition than the
   dry stands. Calluna decreases immediately after fire in all sites, but
   increases from the second year onwards, with the southernmost site
   having the fastest return. Regeneration of grasses, herbs, mosses and
   lichens is also faster in the south. Across all sites, species richness
   decreased the first year after fire, followed by an increase that
   exceeds pre-fire levels by the second year. The number of pioneer
   species entering the heathlands after fire decreases northwards.
   Conclusions
   We found considerable geographic variation, not only in species
   composition, but also in post-fire successional trends and dynamics.
   This is probably linked to higher productivity and larger pools of
   pioneer species in southern sites, and higher growth rates of shrubs and
   mosses in the wet heath habitat. This calls for conservation of a
   geographically diverse set of heathland sites, as well as development of
   regional- and site-specific management plans.}},

   encroached grassland}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{North American grasslands have experienced increased relative abundance
   of shrubs and trees over the last 150 yr. Alterations in herbivore
   composition, abundance, and grazing pressure along with changes in fire
   frequency are drivers that can regulate the transition from grassland to
   shrubland or woodland (a process known as woody encroachment).
   Historically, North American grasslands had a suite of large herbivores
   that grazed and/or browsed (i.e., bison, elk, pronghorn, deer), as well
   as frequent and intense fires. In the tallgrass prairie, many large
   native ungulates were extirpated by the 1860s, corresponding with
   increased homesteading (which led to decreased fire frequencies and
   intensities). Changes in the frequency and intensity of these two
   drivers (browsing and fire) have coincided with woody encroachment in
   tallgrass prairie. Within tallgrass prairie, woody encroachment can be
   categorized in to two groups: non-resprouting species that can be killed
   with fire and resprouting species that cannot be killed with fire.
   Resprouting species require additional active management strategies to
   decrease abundance and eventually be removed from the ecosystem. In this
   study, we investigated plant cover, ramet density, and physiological
   effects of continuous simulated browsing and prescribed fire on Cornus
   drummondii C.A. Mey, a resprouting clonal native shrub species. Browsing
   reduced C. drummondii canopy cover and increased grass cover. We also
   observed decreased ramet density, which allowed for more infilling of
   grasses. Photosynthetic rates between browsed and unbrowsed control
   shrubs did not increase in 2015 or 2016. In 2017, photosynthetic rates
   for browsed shrubs were higher in the unburned site than the unbrowsed
   control shrubs at the end of the growing season. Additionally, after the
   prescribed fire, browsed shrubs had 90\% decreased cover, 50\% reduced
   ramet density, and grass cover increased by 80\%. In the roots of
   browsed shrubs after the prescribed fire, nonstructural carbohydrates
   (NSC) experienced a twofold reduction in glucose and a threefold
   reduction in both sucrose and starch. The combined effects of browsing
   and fire show strong potential as a successful management tool to
   decrease the abundance of clonal-resprouting woody plants in mesic
   grasslands and illustrate the potential significance of browsers as a
   key driver in this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fires are expected to be more frequent and more intense with
   climate change, including in temperate and mountain forest ecosystems.
   In the Alps, forest vulnerability to fire resulting from interactions
   between climate, fuel types, vegetation structure and tree resistance to
   fire is little understood. This paper aims at identifying trends in the
   vulnerability of Alpine forest ecosystems to fire at different scales
   (tree species, stand level and biogeographic level) and according to
   three different climatic conditions (cold season, average summer and
   extremely dry summer). To explore Alpine forest vulnerability to fire,
   we used surface fuel measurements, forest inventory and fire weather
   data to simulate fire behaviour and ultimately post-fire tree mortality
   across 4438 forest plots in the French Alps. The results showed that
   cold season fires (about 50\% of the fires in the French Alps) have a
   limited impact except on low-elevation forests of the Southern Alps
   (mainly Oak, Scots pine). In average summer conditions, mixed and
   broadleaved forests of low elevations suffer the highest mortality rates
   (up to 75\% in coppices). Finally, summer fires occurring in extremely
   dry conditions promote high mortality across all forest communities.
   Lowest mortality rates were observed in high forest stands composed of
   tree species presenting adaptation to surface fires (e.g. thick bark,
   high canopy) such as Larch forests of the internal Alps. This study
   provides insights on the vulnerability of the main tree species and
   forest ecosystems of the French Alps useful for the adaptation of forest
   management practices to climate changes.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   The North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Selvagens present a
   unique biological diversity including, presently, 56 endemic spider
   species. Several recent projects provide valuable information on their
   distribution across most islands and habitats. To date, the only endemic
   spider assessed according to the IUCN Red List criteria is Hogna ingens.
   The objective of this paper is to assess all remaining endemic species
   and advise on possible future conservation actions critical for the
   survival of endangered species.
   New information
   Seven species were found to have a continuing decline in either range or
   population size. Their decline can be mostly attributed to habitat
   destruction or degradation, invasive plant species that reduce quality
   of habitat, forest fires at high mountain regions and possible
   competition for resources from invasive congeners. The tetragnathid M.

   good condition and protection of the laurisilva forests where many live,
   there are a number of species requiring urgent attention and protection
   measures. These include all cave and mountain-restricted species as well
   as those threatened by competing congeners or invasive plants. Extending
   current protected areas, restoring original habitats of threatened

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that habitat restoration will provide for community
   reestablishment and the creation of habitat heterogeneity was examined
   with regards to the herpetofauna of longleaf pine sandhills in northwest
   Florida. The herpetofaunal response to restoration was examined in
   fire-suppressed, hardwood-dominated areas treated with (1) spring fire,
   (2) felling or girdling; or (3) a granular form of the herbicide
   hexazinone. No-treatment controls were also included. Felling or
   girdling and herbicide plots were burned for fuel reduction two dormant
   seasons after initial treatment application. Additionally, data were
   collected in frequently burned reference sandhills to establish the
   target condition or restoration goal. Vegetation variables and
   herpetofaunal capture rates were compared among control and treatment
   areas. Two similarity indices were utilized to compare treatments and
   controls with reference sites, to examine restoration success.
   Restoration treatment effects were observed through reduced hardwood
   densities. Litter composition varied among control and treatment plots,
   with leaf litter being highest in areas lacking recent fire. Capture
   rates of some herpetofaunal species varied significantly among treatment
   plots. In 1997 similarity indices showed that spring-burned and felling
   or girdling plots were more similar to the reference sandhills than the
   other plots. Treated plots were not significantly different from
   controls in 1998, a year of a severe drought.}},

Abstract = {{We quantified breeding bird abundance, diversity, and indicator species

   streams on the east slope of the Cascade Range, Washington, USA. Upland
   dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine

   associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by
   closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant
   associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black
   cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent
   hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages,
   diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and
   adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from
   >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species
   accounted for 75\% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were
   similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high
   evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed
   among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest
   differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests.
   Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic climate change and habitat loss pose major threats to
   grassland breeding birds, the most rapidly declining group of birds in
   continental North America. Although previous studies have investigated
   grassland breeding bird responses to land management, few empirical
   studies explore their responses to climatic variation or its
   interactions with land management, which warrant urgent conservation
   attention. We evaluated the effects of climate and land management
   parameters on an indicator species for grassland breeding birds, the
   Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), a Neotropical migrant of
   conservation concern whose global population has declined by more than
   two thirds since 1970. We quantified Grasshopper Sparrow responses to
   climate variation, land management actions, and their interactions in
   the Platte River Valley, Nebraska, in the North American Great Plains,
   using six years of mark-recapture data collected via the Monitoring
   Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol. We implemented
   generalized linear mixed models to estimate avian population trends
   (adult abundance and productivity) in response to changes in
   precipitation and temperature as well as cattle grazing, haying, and
   prescribed burning. Our models showed that climatic variation,
   especially spring precipitation, was the most important driver of avian
   population trends. Grasshopper Sparrow abundance declined with
   increasing spring precipitation, but prescribed burns helped mitigate
   this effect and were positively related to productivity, especially
   during years of lower spring temperatures. Our findings demonstrate the
   vulnerability of grassland bird population trends to ongoing and

   actions to mitigate some negative effects of climate change on grassland

Abstract = {{The frequency and intensity of salvage logging has recently increased in
   burned forests of the Canadian boreal so that post-fire areas make up a
   significant annual share of all harvested forest land in some years.
   However, little is known about how this practice affects
   re-establishment of animal and plant communities that already have been
   strongly altered by the fire. We pitfall-trapped carabid beetles
   (Coleoptera, Carabidae) for two consecutive years following a
   large-scale boreal wildfire (276,000 ha) in burned mixed-wood forests of
   12 landscape units (2.5 km x 2.5 km each). These units included four
   salvage treatments, each replicated three times: control (no salvaging),
   low (ca. 20-30\% of merchantable mixed-wood removed), moderate (40-50\%)
   and high salvage intensity (60-70\%). We established 16 sampling sites
   in each unit: on the control landscapes, all 16 sites were in un-logged
   stands; in low-salvage units, 4 out of 16 sites were in salvaged areas;
   in moderate- and high-salvage units, 8 and 12 out of 16 sites,
   respectively, were in salvaged areas. Salvage logging positively
   affected carabid species richness. However, there was an overall
   salvage-caused decrease in the abundance of many common forest-dwelling
   carabids, and an increase in the abundance of disturbance or
   open-habitat specialists. Interestingly, the effects of salvage logging
   on the total catch and several abundant forest species (e.g., Calosoma
   frigidum, Harpalus laevipes, Pterostichus punctatissimus, P adstrictus
   and Platynus decentis) appeared to be more important at the landscape
   level (the four landscape treatments) than at the level of sampling
   sites (site logged versus not). We suggest that this observation
   resulted from ambiguous site-level responses to salvage that
   collectively contributed to the (mostly negative) significant responses
   at the landscape level. Effects of fire severity (estimates based on
   tree survival) on carabids were species-specific; however, the impact of
   this measure was most often significant at the site, and not at the
   landscape, level. A Multivariate Regression Tree revealed that fire
   severity and the overall (pre-fire) amount of mixed-wood forest on the
   landscape were significant determinants of assemblage structure, with
   the local effects of fire severity being strongest. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fire is an important ecological process that shapes vegetation structure
   and habitat for faunal assemblages globally. Prescribed burns are
   increasingly being used in conservation and management to restore fire
   regimes in fire-suppressed vegetation communities. Small threatened
   macropods require structurally complex habitat that allows them to evade
   detection by predators. Given that fire can alter vegetation structure,
   it can be viewed as a strong ecological force in shifting the dynamics
   between predator and prey species. Previous studies in temperate
   Australia have shown that prescribed burns in the presence of European
   Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral Cat (Felis catus) can have negative
   impacts on small macropods and medium-sized mammals. Post-fire response
   of threatened small macropods and their predators has not been
   experimentally examined in subtropical Australia despite this region
   providing refugia for the Long-nosed Potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and
   Red-legged Pademelon (Thylogale stigmatica). We conducted a
   before-after-control-impact fire experiment at two paired sites after
   low-moderate intensity burns typical of cool season prescribed burns. We
   used camera trapping to investigate changes in activity of threatened
   small macropods and their predators. We also recorded vegetation change.
   Despite large reductions in ground and shrub cover, activity of small
   macropods and the Dingo (Canis dingo) did not change in response to
   fires. Therefore, the threat of dingo predation appears to have remained
   unchanged following the fires. Although feral cats and foxes were
   present, they showed negligible activity across our sites. Our study
   suggests that small-scale patchy ecological burns may not lead to
   increased predation of small macropods in our landscape. We attribute
   this to sufficient post-fire refugia and very low densities of foxes.}},

Abstract = {{Fire regime characteristics were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees

   fire-scarred samples from conifers (Pinus ayacahuite Ehrenb., Pinus
   durangensis Martinez, and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in three
   25-ha sites arrayed at different watershed positions, from a low site

   periods began in 1702, 1704, or 1761 and continued through the final
   fire in 1955 (two sites) or 1995. All sites had frequent fire regimes
   (mean fire interval (MFI) 3.9-5.2 years; MFI for years in which 25\% or
   more of the samples were scarred: 6.9-8.4 years). Almost all fires
   occurred before cambial growth began or early during the season of
   cambial growth. Fire years were significantly dry, and the years
   immediately preceding fire were significantly wet. After 1955, no
   further fires occurred at two of the three study sites, a pattern

Abstract = {{Human activities and climate change are increasing the size and severity
   of wildfires globally, creating a need for research that links changes
   in fire regimes with community-level responses. The objective of this
   study was to understand how variability in fire regimes influences
   forest regeneration and recruitment patterns and wildlife activity at
   large temporal and spatial scales. Across 25 fires in five National
   Forests (Uinta-Wasatch-Cache NF, Ashley NF, Fishlake NF, Dixie NF, and
   Manti-La Sal NF) in the state of Utah, we examined aspen regeneration
   and recruitment levels, and wildlife and livestock fecal group counts
   along belt transects that spanned gradients of fire size and severity.
   Forest cover change was assessed by comparing pre-fire and post-fire
   satellite images. The fires dated from 1992 to 2002 and were at least 10
   years old when this study was conducted. Fire size and severity were
   positively related to aspen regeneration (density of saplings) and
   recruitment (saplings >2 m in height). There was a significant fire size
   and severity interaction effect on aspen regeneration, such that the
   positive influence of fire size increased with greater fire severity
   (R-2 = 0.40, P < 0.001). Change in the extent of aspen cover was not
   correlated with fire size. Deer and cattle became more dispersed with
   increasing fire size and severity, but elk activity showed no
   difference. Deer preferred low severity burn patches in smaller fires,
   but appeared to avoid low severity patches as fires became larger. Our
   results suggest that fire size and severity are important ecological
   filters that can interact to affect forest development and the
   distribution and abundance of large herbivores. Effective management of
   forest systems in response to altered fire regimes will require an
   understanding of the legacy effects of fire size and severity at the

Abstract = {{Land abandonment and the cessation of traditional management practices
   is favouring scrubland and forest expansion throughout Europe, reducing
   the extent of many semi-natural open habitats of a high ecological
   value. Tree encroachment is threatening several Calluna vulgaris (L.)
   Hull heathlands. The objective of this study was to analyze vegetation
   dynamics resulting from an experiment designed to test management
   options aiming at controlling the encroachment of Populus tremula
   (aspen) and favouring heathland recovery. The research was conducted at
   Vauda Heath, North-western Italy, from 2005 till 2009. We studied
   prescribed burning and goat browsing, both alone or in combination,
   assessing their effects on structure and density of encroaching trees,
   as well as on heathland main species, C vulgaris and Molinia
   arundinacea. Treatments were applied to 42 experimental units (300-650
   m(2) each), with each treatment combination replicated from six to
   twelve times (including untreated controls).
   Prescribed burning and browsing showed complementary effects on
   post-fire vegetation development. Both back and head fire behaviors were
   effective in inducing stem mortality of aspen and rejuvenating the
   heathland, but in the absence of measures to control post-fire
   suckering, aspen tended to recover the pre-treatment stand structure. A
   higher fire frequency (annual winter fire) controlled tree encroachment,
   but hindered Calluna recovery, whilst favouring competing grass species.
   Goat browsing alone was initially able to reduce tree growth and slow
   down woodland expansion, until aspen individuals reached an escape size
   of 1.5 m in height. Prescribed burning followed by yearly goat browsing
   effectively contained tree encroachment while maximizing post-fire
   heathland regeneration. This integrated approach thus proved its
   efficacy also at the southern limits of Calluna distributional area. (C)

Abstract = {{Many species of songbirds in the United States have shown widespread
   declines in population numbers during the last five decades. To
   understand ongoing declines and plan for conservation, researchers need
   reliable estimates of adult survival and site fidelity. However,
   variation in adult survival and site fidelity within and among species
   is substantial and could have consequences for management. Estimates of
   adult survival are lacking for many bird species and ecoregions,
   including the Great Plains. In this field study, we used
   Cormack-Jolly-Sober mark-recapture models to analyze encounter histories
   of 17 species of birds captured with a 13-year systematic mist-netting
   effort in northeast Kansas. We estimated annual rates of apparent adult
   survival (01 and corrected for the probability of capture (p), and
   tested for effects of sex and breeding habitat guild. We present the
   first estimates of apparent survival for six species of songbirds, and
   the first estimates from the Great Plains for 13 species. Apparent
   survival tended to be higher for males than for females, and we found a
   sex effect on the probability of capture for one species. Unexpectedly,
   grassland- and shrubland-breeding species had higher estimates of
   apparent survival than forest-breeding species. Our results did not
   support the prevailing viewpoint that birds breeding in dynamic
   landscapes, such as frequently burned grasslands, should show lower
   apparent survival than species that breed in woody habitats. We
   demonstrate that habitat plays an important role in the survival and
   site fidelity of songbirds, and that regional differences in habitat
   structure could drive variation in demography. Understanding the drivers
   of true survival and site fidelity of songbirds will allow
   region-specific management for species of conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{Fire frequency in low-elevation coniferous forests in western North
   America has greatly declined since the late 1800s. In many areas, this
   has increased tree density and the proportion of shade-tolerant species,
   reduced resource availability, and increased forest susceptibility to
   forest insect pests and high-severity wildfire. In response, treatments
   are often implemented with the goal of increasing ecosystem resilience
   by increasing resistance to disturbance. We capitalized on an existing
   replicated study of fire and stand density treatments in a ponderosa
   pine (Pinus ponderosa)-Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest in
   western Montana, USA, that experienced a naturally occurring mountain
   pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak 5 yr after
   implementation of fuels treatments. We explored whether treatment
   effects on tree-level defense and stand structure affected resistance to
   MPB. Mortality from MPB was highest in the denser, untreated control and
   burn-only treatments, with approximately 50\% and 39\%, respectively, of
   ponderosa pine killed during the outbreak, compared to almost no
   mortality in the thin-only and thin-burn treatments. Thinning
   treatments, with or without fire, dramatically increased tree growth and
   resin ducts relative to control and burn-only treatments. Prescribed
   burning did not increase resin ducts but did cause changes in resin
   chemistry that may have affected MPB communication and lowered attack
   success. While ponderosa pine remained dominant in the thin and
   thin-burn treatments after the outbreak, the high pine mortality in the
   control and burn-only treatment caused a shift in species dominance to
   Douglas-fir. The high Douglas-fir component in the control and burn-only
   treatments due to 20th century fire exclusion, coupled with high pine
   mortality from MPB, has likely reduced resilience of this forest beyond
   the ability to return to a ponderosa pine-dominated system in the
   absence of further fire or mechanical treatment. Our results show
   treatments designed to increase resistance to high-severity fire in
   ponderosa pine-dominated forests in the Northern Rockies can also

Abstract = {{Progress in implementing ecosystem approaches to conservation and
   restoration is slowed by legitimate concerns about the effects of such
   approaches on individual imperiled species. The perceived conflict
   between the restoration of fire-excluded forests and concomitant
   reduction of dense fuels and high-severity wildfire, versus the recovery
   of endangered species, has led to a policy ambiguity that has slowed
   on-the-ground action at a time when active management is urgently
   needed, both for ecosystem restoration and species conservation. The
   Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalis lucida) in the southwestern
   U.S.A. is emblematic of this perceived conflict, with numerous appeals
   and lawsuits focused on the species and vast acres of forest managed
   with habitat quality for this species in mind. We use spatial analysis
   across large landscapes in Arizona to examine potential conflicts
   between the desire to reduce the likelihood of uncharacteristically
   severe wildfire and restore native fire regimes, and the concurrent
   desire and legal mandate to manage forests for the recovery of the owl.
   Our spatially explicit analysis indicates that real conflicts between
   these management objectives exist, but that locations where conflicts
   might inhibit active forest management represent less than 1/3 of the
   811,000 ha study region. Furthermore, within the areas where conflicts
   might be expected, the majority of the forest could be managed in ways
   that would reduce fire hazard without eliminating owl habitat. Finally,
   management treatments that emphasize ecosystem restoration might improve
   the suitability of large areas of forest habitat in the southwest that
   is currently unsuitable for owls. These results demonstrate that even
   where policy conflicts exist, their magnitude has been overstated.
   Active restoration of dry forests from which fire has been excluded is
   compatible in many areas with conservation and recovery of the owl.
   Identifying and prioritizing areas to meet the dual goals of ecosystem
   restoration and imperiled species conservation require a broad spatial
   approach that is analytically feasible but currently underutilized.
   Working together, conservation biologists, restoration ecologists, and
   forest managers can employ landscape-level spatial analysis to identify
   appropriate areas for management attention, identify suitable management
   practices, and explore the predicted consequences of alternative
   management scenarios on forests, fire ecology, and the fate of sensitive
   species of conservation concern. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   trait-habitat (using Fourth-corner and RLQ analyses) and habitat
   occupancy patterns (logistic regression models) of bird assemblages in
   boreal forest stands following disturbances by forest fire and salvage
   logging. The stands differed in the amount and composition of residual
   tree retention, salvage- and aquatic-edges, degree of burn severity (all
   measured at 100 and 500 m buffers), as well as landscape-level variables
   such as distance to previously burned forests. Tests of trait-habitat
   relationships showed that canopy-nesters and bark- and foliage-
   insectivores required high levels of residual trees of low burn
   severity, with the feeding guilds showing affinity for different stand
   composition. In contrast, ground-nesters and omnivores thrived in
   salvaged areas and associated edges. In addition, cavity-nesting and
   ground-foragers were associated with severely burned stands. The
   species' habitat occupancy patterns were commensurate with trait
   requirements, which also appeared to be scale-dependent. For example,
   some fire-associated species had high occupancy probability in severely
   burned stands at small-scale (100 m buffer), which was consistent with
   their cavity-nesting trait. This pattern, however, was not evident at
   large-scale, where their feeding requirement (bark-insectivores) for

Abstract = {{The ecology of Australia's tropical savannas is shaped by the
   near-pervasive influence of fire. Constituting similar to 20\% of
   Australia's land area, tropical savannas contribute >75\% of the area
   burnt in Australia each year. Across most of Australia's tropical
   savannas, components of biodiversity are declining, including many
   species of birds. This review seeks to assess whether that decline is
   linked to current fire regimes. However, relevant studies are few,
   short-term and opportunistic, and indicate rather than demonstrate the
   effects of fire. There is no set of agreed paradigms for contextualising
   the relationship between birds and fire regimes in this region or for
   any management consequences. We conclude that the current fire regime is
   suboptimal for many species of birds, particularly for granivores,
   frugivores, hollow-dependent species and those that nest on or near the
   ground. For conservation reserves, we recommend that fire management
   protocols include the explicit targets that: (1) at least 25\% of the
   savanna landscape is at least 3 years unburnt; (2) at least 5\% is at
   least 10 years unburnt; (3) fire-sensitive non-savanna vegetation types

Abstract = {{Fire can often occur in aquatic ecosystems, which may affect aquatic
   invertebrates. Despite the importance of aquatic invertebrates to
   ecosystem function, the effect of fire on these environments has been
   little studied. We studied the effects of fire on aquatic invertebrates
   in artesian springs in the arid zone of South Australia. Artesian
   springs are a unique and threatened ecosystem, containing several rare
   and endemic species. Evidence suggests these wetlands were routinely
   burnt by indigenous Aboriginal people before European settlement over
   100 years ago. Recently, burning has been suggested as a reinstated
   management tool to control the dominant reed Phragmites australis. A
   reduction in the cover of the reed may benefit the threatened flora and
   fauna through enhancement of water flow. Three artesian springs were
   burnt and aquatic invertebrates sampled from the burnt and three unburnt
   springs. A single fire in late winter completely burnt the dominant
   vegetation, followed by recovery of Phragmites over the following 2
   years. A single fire event did not deplete populations of endemic
   aquatic invertebrates in artesian springs, but probably did not
   substantially benefit these populations either. Isopods, amphipods,
   ostracods and three species of hydrobiid snail survived the fire event,
   and most had increased in number 1 month post fire but then returned to
   pre-burnt numbers by 1 year post fire. Morphospecies richness of all
   identified invertebrates increased over time in all springs, but did not
   differ appreciably between burnt and unburnt springs. If burning
   artesian springs is to be adopted as a management tool to suppress the
   growth of Phragmites australis, we conclude that the endemic aquatic
   invertebrates will survive a single burn event, without negative effect
   to their populations.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used to reverse invasion by woody vegetation on
   grasslands, but managers often are uncertain whether influences of shrub
   and tree reduction outweigh potential effects of fire on nest survival
   of grassland birds. During the 2001-2003 breeding seasons, we examined
   relationships of prescribed fire and woody vegetation to nest survival
   of clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida) and Savannah sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) in mixed-grass prairie at Des Lacs National
   Wildlife Refuge in northwestern North Dakota, USA. We assessed
   relationships of nest survival to 1) recent fire history, in terms of
   number of breeding seasons (2, 3, or 4-5) since the last prescribed
   fire, and 2) prevalence of trees and tall (> 1.5 m) shrubs in the
   landscape and of low (<= 1.5 m) shrubs within 5mof nests. Nest survival
   of both species exhibited distinct patterns related to age of the nest
   and day of year, but bore no relationship to fire history. Survival of
   clay-colored sparrow nests declined as the amount of trees and tall
   shrubs within 100mincreased, but we found no relationship to suggest
   nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) as an
   underlying mechanism. We found little evidence linking nest survival of
   Savannah sparrow to woody vegetation. Our results suggest that fire can
   be used to restore northern mixed-grass prairies without adversely
   affecting nest survival of >= 2 widespread passerine species. Survival
   of nests of clay-colored sparrow may increase when tall woody cover is
   reduced by fire. Our data lend support to the use of fire for reducing
   scattered patches of tall woody cover to enhance survival of nests of >=

Abstract = {{In the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, unusually high rates of sea level rise
   threaten endemic tidal marsh birds, while prescribed burning benefits
   these bird populations. Effective conservation of tidal marsh birds
   requires that management actions be prioritized based on their impact to
   the long-term population viability for these species. We used a
   population viability analysis to evaluate the relative influence of two
   sea level rise scenarios and two prescribed fire management scenarios on
   the population viability of seaside sparrows, a tidal marsh obligate
   species, at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and Fishing Bay Wildlife
   Management Area. Marsh loss caused by rising sea levels had a greater
   impact on seaside sparrow population viability than did prescribed fire.
   Limiting marsh loss over the next 50 years to 15\% of the present extent
   caused a 19\% probability of reaching the quasi-extinction threshold,
   while losing 33\% of extant marsh caused a 50\% probability of reaching
   the quasi-extinction threshold. Prescribed fire increased the likelihood
   of seaside sparrow persistence; increasing the amount of
   frequently-burned marsh from 12\% to 53\% lowered the quasi-extinction
   probability from 0.20 to 0.10. Slowing the rate of marsh loss will have
   a greater positive effect on seaside sparrow viability than increasing

Abstract = {{The Highway Fire burned 1680 ha of mixed ponderosa pine-oak-chaparral in
   the newly created Giant Sequoia National Monument and the adjacent
   Sequoia National Forest of Fresno County, California in August 2001. The
   USDA Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) program
   recommended that portions of the burned forest be seeded with a
   non-persistent variety of wheat at a density of 157 kg ha(-1) (140
   lb/ac). The present study compared the vascular plant diversity and
   cover in seeded and unseeded parts of this burn to evaluate the
   ecological impact of seeding an alien grass. In the first post-fire
   growing season, the natural regeneration of unseeded control sites
   averaged similar to55\% ground surface covered. Wheat seeding enhanced
   the ground cover, averaging 95\% ground surface cover. Wheat was the
   dominant species on the seeded sites, comprising 67\% of the total
   cover. Dominance-diversity curves were markedly affected by the seeding
   and indicated a disruption in the natural ecological structure of these
   communities. On seeded sites, wheat dominated and all other species were
   poorly represented whereas, on unseeded control sites, there was a more
   equitable distribution of species. Correlated with the wheat cover was a
   significant decrease in species richness at all scales examined. Total
   species richness was reduced from 152 species across all unseeded sites
   to 104 species on all seeded sites. Average species richness, at scales
   from 1 to 1000 m(2), was 30-40\% lower on seeded sites. Species most
   strongly inhibited were post-fire endemics whose lifecycle is restricted
   to immediate post-fire environments. Seeded sites had fewer alien
   species than unseeded sites; however, this may not have any lasting
   effect since other studies show the primary alien threat is not in the
   first post-fire year. Seeding was also associated with an order of
   magnitude drop in Pinus ponderosa seedling recruitment and, coupled with
   the massive thatch still remaining on the site, it is likely that
   recruitment will be inhibited in subsequent years.}},

Journal = {{CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Conifer regeneration failure in the presence of dense ericaceous cover
   resulting from the removal of canopy trees by forest harvesting observed
   in boreal and temperate forest has been attributed to allelopathy,
   competition, and soil nutrient imbalance. Ecosystem-level alleopathic
   effect has been argued as a cause for conifer regeneration failure by
   citing examples from a species-poor boreal forest in northern Sweden
   with ground vegetation dominated by crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum,
   Ericales) and New Zealand dairy pastures invaded by nodding or musk
   thistle (Carduus nutans). This article aims to explain the phenomenon of
   vegetation shift from conifer forest to ericaceous heath by extending
   the argument of ecosystem-level impact of ericaceous plants and linking
   the disturbance-mediated regeneration strategies of the dominant conifer
   species and the understory ericaceous species with the quality of
   seedbed substrate that influence the direction of secondary succession.
   It has been argued that fire severity plays a pivotal role in
   controlling seedbed quality and the regeneration mechanisms of conifers,
   which in turn determines the direction of post-disturbance succession.
   The post-fire-dominated ericaceous plants and their habitat-modifying
   effects have been explained from the point of view of keystone species
   concept and their role as ecosystem engineers. In the absence of high
   severity natural fires the canopy keystone species (conifer) fails to
   regenerate successfully mainly due to limitation of favorable seedbed.
   On the other hand, the understory ericaceous plants regenerate
   vigorously by vegetative methods from the belowground components that
   survived the fire. Forest harvesting by clearcutting or selective
   cutting also create similar vigorous vegetative regrowth of ericaceous
   plants, but conifer regeneration suffers from the lack of a suitable
   seedbed. Thus in the absence of successful conifer regeneration, the
   vigorously growing understory ericaceous plants become the new keystone
   species. The new keystone ericaceous species bring about a significant
   long-term habitat change by rapid accumulation of plyphenol-rich humus.
   Ericaceous phenolic compounds have been found to inhibit seed
   germination and seedling growth of conifers. By forming protein-phenol
   complexes they cause a further reduction of available nitrogen of the
   already nutrient-stressed habitat. A low pH condition in the presence of
   phenolic compounds causes the leaching of metallic ions and forms hard
   iron pans that impair soil water movement. The phenolic allelochemicals
   of ericaceous humus are also inhibitory to many conifer ectomycorrhizae.
   On the other hand, ericaceous plants perpetuate in the community by
   their stress-tolerating strategies as well as their ability to acquire
   nutrients through ericoid mycorrhizae. Three mechanisms working at the
   ecosystem level can be suggested as the cause of vegetation shift from
   forest to ericaceous heath. These are (1) the absence of high severity
   natural fire and the limitation of suitable conifer seedbed in the
   presence of thick humus, (2) increased competition resulting from the
   rapid vegetative regeneration of understory ericaceous plants after
   forest canopy opening by harvesting or nonsevere fire, and (3) habitat
   degradation by phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous plants causing a
   soil nutrient imbalance and iron pan formation. Thus, a shift in
   keystone species from conifer to ericaceous plant in the
   post-disturbance habitat may induce a retrogressive succession due to
   ecosystem-level engineering effects of the new keystone species.
   Vegetation management in conifer-ericaceous communities depends on land
   management objectives. If the objective is to produce timber and other
   forest products then the control of ericaceous plants and site
   preparation is necessary after forest harvesting. Ploughing and liming
   followed by conifer planting and repeated N fertilization has been
   applied successfully to promote afforestation of Calluna heathlands in
   Britain. However, such practice has not been proven successful in the
   reforestation of Kalmia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. If, on the
   other hand, the land management objective is to maintain heathlands for
   herbivore production or conservation of cultural landscape, as in the
   case of certain Calluna-dominated heathland in Western Europe, then
   moderately hot prescribed burning is useful as a management tool.}},

Abstract = {{1. Burning of slash (woody debris) piles resulting from the harvest of
   fuel wood is a common management technique designed to reduce fire risk
   and increase establishment of understorey vegetation in many semi-arid
   woodlands. However, the consequences of slash burning on plant
   communities and their below-ground fungal mutualists are poorly
   understood.
   2. We examined how the burning of slash piles affected understorey plant
   communities and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in a pinyon-juniper
   woodland in northern Arizona, USA, 5 years after harvesting. We analysed
   plant communities and AM inoculum potential along 16 transects in: (i)
   burned slash pile sites; (ii) interspaces between burned slash piles;
   (iii) non-burned canopy sites; and (iv) non-burned interspaces. We
   quantified AM colonization of dominant native and exotic plants in
   burned and non-burned areas.
   3. Burned areas had significantly fewer understorey plant species than
   non-burned areas, and exotic species were four times more abundant at
   burned slash sites than at other sites.
   4. Exotic plants from burned and non-burned areas exhibited levels of AM
   colonization that were 50\% greater than native plants. Bioassay and
   field-collected plants exhibited similar levels of AM colonization and
   there were no significant treatment differences.
   5. The total biomass of bioassay plants grown in soil from burned slash
   sites averaged 19\% greater than plant biomass from other sites, and had
   27\% more phosphorus in their shoot tissue; however, tissue nitrogen
   contents were similar.
   6. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that either fire
   did not reduce AM inoculum potential, or that AM fungal populations
   recovered in the 5 years after the slash was burned. Changes in
   understorey plant communities and increases in exotic species with
   burning could result from other soil changes (e.g. species of AM fungi
   present), reduction of native species in the seed bank or greater
   dispersal ability of exotic plants compared with native plant species.
   We suggest that burning slash piles as a management tool in
   pinyon-juniper woodlands can result in plant communities that are
   persistently dominated by exotic species. Management approaches that
   utilize fuel wood harvest alone or that incorporate seeding of native
   plants may achieve the desired results.}},

   winter-green species. Traditional management increased the compositional
   variability among plots. Species richness remained almost constant in
   burned plots, and fluctuated in unmanaged plots, while in all cut plots
   there was a significant increase in species richness. Within cutting
   treatments, richness increased relatively more in the plots that were
   cut by a machine. Results from the 6-year field experiment suggest that
   mulching is the most cost-effective management regime in floodplain
   meadows, but only in combination with mowing (cutting with removal of
   the hay crop) every second or third year, providing the best management
   practice in the long run.}},

Title = {{Impact of wildfire size on snowshoe hare relative abundance in southern
   British Columbia, Canada}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Large wildfires result in more heterogeneous fire scars than
   do smaller fires because of differences in landscape context and high
   variability in burn intensity and severity. Previous research on mammal
   response to wildfire has often considered all fires as comparable
   disturbances regardless of size. Here, we explicitly examine whether
   fire size affects relative abundances of a keystone herbivore, snowshoe
   hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben, 1777), in regenerating stands of the
   same age. We surveyed vegetation and fecal pellets of snowshoe hares in
   nine 13-year-old wildfires, specifically, three fires in three size
   categories-small (80 to 200 ha), medium (1000 to 5000 ha), and large
   (>10 000 ha)-and in mature forests in southern British Columbia, Canada.
   Results: Snowshoe hare density was low (0.4 hares ha(-1)), but hares
   were present at 57\% of mature sites. Hares were absent from all areas
   where small fires had burned and were found in only one medium area post
   fire (0.2 hares ha(-1)). Hares were found within the fire scars of all
   three large burned areas, and with much higher numbers (3.8 hares
   ha(-1)) than in the medium fire area or mature forest. Snowshoe hare
   abundance was highly correlated with the number of sapling trees,
   especially lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon). Sapling
   densities were highly variable, but dense stands of saplings were found
   only in burn scars from large wildfires.
   Conclusions: Fire size is an important predictor of snowshoe hare
   relative abundance in areas that are regenerating post fire; fires of
   different sizes are not comparable disturbances. Specifically, the
   post-fire heterogeneity after large fires enabled both the highest hare
   numbers as well as patches with no hares. These results suggest that
   forest and wildlife managers should protect areas with dense
   regeneration post fire, as these sites are necessary for hares after
   large wildfires.}},

Title = {{Landscape-scale effects of fire on bird assemblages: does pyrodiversity

Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{519-529}},

Abstract = {{Aim A common strategy for conserving biodiversity in fire-prone
   environments is to maintain a diversity of post-fire age classes at the
   landscape scale, under the assumption that pyrodiversity begets
   biodiversity. Another strategy is to maintain extensive areas of a
   particular seral state regarded as vital for the persistence of
   threatened species, under the assumption that this will also cater for
   the habitat needs of other species. We investigated the likely effects
   of these strategies on bird assemblages in tree mallee vegetation,
   characterized by multi-stemmed Eucalyptus species, where both strategies
   are currently employed.
   Location The semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia.
   Methods We systematically surveyed birds in 26 landscapes (each 4-km
   diameter), selected to represent gradients in the diversity of fire age
   classes and the proportion of older vegetation (> 35 years since fire).
   Additional variables were measured to represent underlying vegetation-or
   fire-mediated properties of the landscape, as well as its biogeographic
   context. We used an informationtheoretic approach to investigate the
   relationships between these predictor variables and the species richness
   of birds (total species, threatened species and rare species).
   Results Species richness of birds was not strongly associated with
   fire-mediated heterogeneity. Species richness was associated with
   increasing amounts of older vegetation in landscapes, but not with the
   proportion of recently burned vegetation in landscapes.
   Main conclusions The preference of many mallee birds for older
   vegetation highlights the risk of a blanket application of the `
   pyrodiversity begets biodiversity' paradigm. If application of this
   paradigm involved converting large areas from long unburned to recently
   burned vegetation to increase firemediated heterogeneity in tree mallee
   landscapes, our findings suggest that this could threaten birds. This
   research highlights the value of adopting a landscapescale perspective
   when evaluating the utility of fire-management strategies intended to
   benefit biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the short-term effects of a catastrophic windstorm and
   subsequent salvage-logging and prescribed-burning fuel-reduction
   treatments on ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages in a
   sub-boreal forestin northeastern Minnesota, USA. During 2000-2003,29,873
   ground beetles represented by 71 species were caught in unbaited and
   baited pitfall traps in aspen/birch/conifer (ABC) and jack pine UP)
   cover types. At the family level, both land-area treatment and cover
   type had significant effects on ground beetle trap catches, but there
   were no effects of pinenes and ethanol as baits. Six times more beetles
   were trapped in the burned forests than in the other land-area
   treatments; more beetles were caught in undisturbed than in
   wind-disturbed sites, and one-third more beetles were caught in the ABC
   than in the JP cover type. Thus, the windstorm generally reduced the
   activity-abundance of the beetles, but prescribed-burning increased it.
   Both salvaged and burned forest plots (especially in the ABC cover type)
   had the greatest species richness, diversity, and the most unique
   species assemblages. There was a highly similar ground beetle species
   composition (nearly 100\%) between the ABC and JP burned forests,
   indicating that burning was a more primary driver of composition than
   cover type. At the species level. Pterostichus melanarius, an invasive
   ground beetle from Europe and a cover type generalist, was the most
   abundant beetle in the study (one-third of the total catch), and was
   caught in greatest numbers in burned forests. Removal of P. melanarius
   from the species composition analyses altered similarities among cover
   types and land-area treatments. Sphaeroderus nitidicollis brevoorti and
   Myas cyanescens were caught exclusively in the ABC and JP cover type,
   respectively; two rare pyrophilous species, Sericoda obsoleta and
   Sericoda quadripunctata, were only caught in burned sites; three forest
   species, Pterostichus coracinus, P. pensylvanicus, and Sphaeroderus
   lecontei, were caught more often in undisturbed JP sites; and two
   frequently trapped, open-habitat species, Agonum cupripenne and Poecilus
   l. lucublandus, were nearly absent from the undisturbed and
   wind-disturbed sites, as salvage-logging had a significant positive
   effect on their activity-abundance. Most species of Amara and Harpalus
   were trapped only in the salvaged or burned sites, indicating invasion
   ofthese disturbed sites by open-habitat species. We conclude that both
   the combined effect of fuel-reduction activities subsequent to the wind
   event and the numerical response of the invasive P. melanarius to
   habitat disturbances can alter the short-term succession of ground
   beetle assemblages in the sub-boreal forest. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable forest management requires a sound understanding of the
   impacts of forestry management practices, especially prescribed fire and
   timber harvesting, on biodiversity. Many studies have examined the
   impacts of fire and logging separately, but few have considered them
   together. Here we describe the combined effects of selective logging and
   repeated prescribed fire on ants in eucalypt forest near Eden in
   south-eastern Australia. The study was conducted within 18 experimental
   coupes comprising three replicates of each of six treatments,
   representing combinations of two logging (selectively logged and
   unlogged) and three prescribed burning (unburnt, routine and high fire
   frequency over 20 years) practices. Ants were sampled using terrestrial
   and arboreal pitfall traps in two plots within each of the 18 coupes. A
   total of 92 species from 35 genera were recorded, with ant species
   richness increasing with both increasing fire frequency and selective
   harvesting. We also found significant differences in ant species
   composition between management treatments; however, these differences
   were rather modest, and apparent only between extremes of fire and
   harvesting combinations. Logging on its own was not a significant factor
   contributing to variation in ant species composition. However, the
   responses of two common species and a key functional group to fire
   depended on logging treatment; in each case their abundance decreased
   with increasing fire frequency at unlogged sites, but increased at
   logged sites. The general resilience of ant communities suggests that
   forests remain in good functional health even when subject to a
   combination of selective logging and frequent burning. However, our
   study under-sampled species with specialist microhabitat requirements,
   and these might have been more heavily impacted. We have also revealed
   some significant interactions between the effects of fire and logging,
   which highlights the importance of considering combined impacts of
   forest management practices. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by

Abstract = {{The Western Division of New South Wales is an administrative region of
   325000 km2 on the eastern fringe of the Australian arid zone. Since
   European settlement in 1788, 71 species of native mammals have been
   recorded in the Division, seven more have been documented only as
   sub-fossils, and a further 15 species occur within 100 km of the
   Division boundary. At least 27 of the original species have become
   regionally extinct, and a further 11 have declined in distribution. As
   in other regions of Australia, species losses have been greatest for
   rodents and marsupials in a critical weight range of 35 5500 g, and
   least for bats. However, percentage losses among the terrestrial fauna
   are high relative to other regions, and probably reflect both the early
   settlement of New South Wales and the marginal distribution in the
   Division of 49\% of the original fauna. Feral cats are implicated in the
   regional extinction of up to ten species of native mammals prior to
   1857. Subsequent extinctions and range reductions are attributed to
   combinations of causes, including predation from cats Felis catus and
   red foxes Vulpes vulpes, competition and habitat degradation from
   rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, stock and other introduced herbivores,
   clearing of trees, changes in fire regimes and human persecution.
   We identified 28 species of particular conservation concern in the
   Division based on low abundance, distribution or survival prognosis.
   Nine species are of national significance, four of state, and 15 of
   regional, significance. The major current threats to these species are
   from grazing by stock, interference from feral mammals and clearing.
   Further land reservation is an important conservation measure, but must
   be complemented by more effective management of non-reserved land and by
   broad-scale management of feral species and other threatening processes
   if the current species diversity is to be maintained. Long-term fauna
   surveys should be initiated throughout the Western Division to provide
   feedback on the effectiveness of management measures, and species
   reintroductions should be considered in situations where threats have
   been removed.}},

Abstract = {{1. Fire suppression and reduced volumes of dead wood have led to a major
   decline in pyrophilous and saproxylic insects in Fennoscandian boreal
   forests. As a consequence, several species are currently seriously
   threatened. Flat bugs (Heteroptera, Aradidae) is an important
   invertebrate group that includes several pyrophilous species, including
   many threatened ones.
   2. We explored whether specific conservation measures - prescribed
   burning and retention forestry - can facilitate the survival of flat
   bugs in managed forests. The large-scale field experiment consisted of a
   burning treatment (yes/no) and four levels of logging intensity
   (clear-cut, retention levels of 10 and 50 m(3) ha(-1), and unharvested
   controls). The data included 1224 individuals of 12 species, sampled
   over a 4-year period.
   3. Burning increased the species richness and abundance of the
   pyrophilous species. Two Red-Listed and very rare pyrophilous species,
   Aradus angularis J. Sahlberg (Vulnerable) and A. laeviusculus Reuter
   (Near Threatened), were abundant after burning. The number of
   non-pyrophilous flat bugs collapsed after burning but they re-colonised
   the stands quickly, becoming as abundant as at the unburned stands.
   Logging increased the abundance of flat bugs only when retention
   forestry was applied.
   4. This study shows that pyrophilous flat bugs are quickly able to
   locate recently burned forests and that these forests are important for
   their survival. The effect of fire is, however, transient at the stand
   level and pyrophilous species disappear almost completely quickly after
   fire. To maintain these species, recently burned forests with a
   sufficient volume of retention trees should be available continuously at
   the landscape level.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the increase in wood demand, the reduction in the
   availability of timber resources and the northern expansion of timber
   harvesting, along with the general perception that wildfires create
   ecological disasters, have favoured an increase in salvage logging in
   burned boreal forests. Concurrently, pioneer studies have shown that
   these post-fire forests may represent important habitats for several
   wildlife species and that intensive salvage logging, by removing
   standing snags, has several impacts on wildlife. However, the effects of
   salvage logging on biodiversity have yet to be considered in post-fire
   management plans. We examine the issue of salvage logging for wildlife
   in the boreal forest, with particular reference to Quebec as an example.
   We describe our current state of knowledge on the use of burned forests
   by some wildlife and on the impacts of salvage logging on these
   habitats. We conclude that snag retention at multiple spatial and

Abstract = {{We conducted an experiment using infrared-triggered camera traps to

   gallopavo) and all mammals captured on film, used pine flatwoods habitat
   in a fire management unit (FMU) with a post-fire recovery history of 24
   months significantly more than adjacent pine flatwoods in an FMU with a
   post-fire recovery history of 48 months (P = 0.04). Data suggested that
   the relative abundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was
   also higher in the 24-month post-fire FMU (P = 0.12) compared to the
   48-month FMU. To evaluate response of wildlife to prescribed fire, we
   burned the 48-month FMU and, after approximately 8 weeks, repeated the
   camera-trap surveys in the newly burned (<6-month) FMU and the adjacent

   data suggested that wildlife did not avoid pine flatwoods habitat at up
   to 30-month post-fire recovery. Wildlife use of pine flatwoods habitat,
   therefore, was observed to increase in areas recently burned (<6 months
   post-fire), was similar between FMUs with post-fire recovery of <6 and
   up to 30 months, and was lowest in habitat that had not been burned for
   48 months. Maintaining a prescribed-fire rotation of less than or equal

Abstract = {{Whitebark pine is a keystone species in upper subalpine forests of the
   northern Rocky Mountains, Cascades, and Sierra Nevada that has been
   declining because of recent mountain pine beetle and exotic blister rust
   epidemics, coupled with advancing succession resulting from fire
   exclusion. Whitebark pine and Wilderness have a mutually beneficial
   relationship because 1) half of whitebark. pine's range is in
   wilderness, 2) many wildlife species depend on whitebark pine
   ecosystems, 3) whitebark pine forests have high recreation value, and 4)
   whitebark pine landscapes contain unique ecological processes.
   Wilderness has not escaped the ravages of beetle, rust and fire
   exclusion, so restoration of these ecosystems may be warranted in some
   areas. The best wilderness restoration tool appears to be prescribed
   fires, especially management-ignited burns. This paper discusses
   whitebark pine ecology and the importance of the species to wilderness,
   and presents restoration treatments and management alternatives for
   these remote settings.}},

Abstract = {{While ecosystem services and climate change are often examined
   independently, quantitative assessments integrating these fields are
   needed to inform future land management decisions. Using
   climate-informed state-and-transition simulations, we examined projected
   trends and tradeoffs for a suite of ecosystem services under four
   climate change scenarios and two management scenarios (active management
   emphasizing fuel treatments and no management other than fire
   suppression) in a fire-prone landscape of dry and moist mixed-conifer
   forests in central Oregon, USA. Focal ecosystem services included fire
   potential (regulating service), timber volume (provisioning service),
   and potential wildlife habitat (supporting service). Projections without
   climate change suggested active management in dry mixed-conifer forests
   would create more open forest structures, reduce crown fire potential,
   and maintain timber stocks, while in moist mixed-conifer forests, active
   management would reduce crown fire potential but at the expense of
   timber stocks. When climate change was considered, however, trends in
   most ecosystem services changed substantially, with large increases in
   wildfire area predominating broad-scale trends in outputs, regardless of
   management approach (e.g., strong declines in timber stocks and habitat
   for closed-forest wildlife species). Active management still had an
   influence under a changing climate, but as a moderator of the strong
   climate-driven trends rather than being a principal driver of ecosystem
   service outputs. These results suggest projections of future ecosystem
   services that do not consider climate change may result in unrealistic
   expectations of benefits.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Demographic modelling predicts the critically endangered Clanwilliam
   cedar (Widdringtonia wallichii), an iconic conifer of South Africa, to
   be headed for extinction. Due to an apparent mismatch in life-history
   traits with the local fire regime, such as time to reproductive maturity
   exceeding mean fire return intervals and no clear seed dispersal agent,
   it is considered poorly adapted to its fire-prone environment.
   Here we focus on two key demographic knowledge gaps, seed dispersal and
   germination, and suggest cedars are highly adapted to wildfires. Our
   natural history observations show that seeds are scatterhoarded by the
   Cape spiny mouse (Acomys subspinosus) to safe sites that are optimal for
   germination. In many cedar sites spiny mice are absent, scatter-hoarding
   has collapsed, and seed predation by the Namaqua rock rat (Micaelamys
   namaquensis) is most frequently observed. Additionally, seeds are
   fire-stimulated. However, 85\% of trees experienced ca. 70\% of their
   fires before annual seed fall, limiting recruitment opportunities.
   Our results suggest the cedar is strongly fire-adapted, and that the
   main demographic hurdle presently is not high adult mortality in fires
   but poor post-fire recruitment. Consequently, conservation emphasis
   should be on increasing recruitment rather than mitigating adult
   mortality. We suggest the following conservation measures: i) prescribed
   fires after seed fall (i.e. late autumn) to allow for scatterhoarding by
   rodents, ii) artificial burial of pre-heated seeds in burned stands in
   late autumn to optimise recruitment, and iii) planting locally dense
   stands of seeds/seedlings to guarantee predator satiation of seeds and
   thus strongly establish the scatterhoarding mutualism required for
   effective recruitment. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Fire over the past decade has affected forests in the San Bernardino
   Mountains of southern California, providing an excellent opportunity to
   examine how this disturbance, and subsequent post-fire salvage logging,
   influenced California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis)
   breeding-season site occupancy dynamics there and in the nearby San
   Jacinto Mountains. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for
   all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and
   colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season
   sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects
   of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in
   habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects
   of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of
   southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and
   logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the
   model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and
   extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy
   probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites.
   Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative
   to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship
   between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of
   forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at
   high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and
   roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50ha of forested habitat
   within the core area burned at high severity had extinction
   probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than
   approximately 50ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction
   probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare
   severely burned. The majority (75\%) of sites burned below this
   threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50ha of forested
   habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be
   monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage
   logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We
   also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions
   along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations
   where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire. (c) 2013 The

Title = {{The diversity of post-fire regeneration strategies in the cerrado ground
   layer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Disentangling species strategies that confer resilience to natural
   disturbances is key to conserving and restoring savanna ecosystems. Fire
   is a recurrent disturbance in savannas, and savanna vegetation is highly
   adapted to and often dependent on fire. However, although the woody
   component of tropical savannas is well studied, we still do not
   understand how ground-layer plant communities respond to fire, limiting
   conservation and management actions. We investigated the effects of
   prescribed fire on community structure and composition, and evaluated
   which traits are involved in plant community regeneration after fire in
   the cerrado ground layer. We assessed traits related to species
   persistence and colonization capacity after fire, including resprouter
   type, underground structure, fire-induced flowering, regeneration
   strategy and growth form. We searched for functional groups related to
   response to fire, to shed light on the main strategies of post-fire
   recovery among species in the ground layer. Fire changed ground-layer
   community structure and composition in the short term, leading to
   greater plant species richness, population densities and increasing bare
   soil, compared with unburned communities. Eight months after fire,
   species abundance did not differ from pre-disturbance values for 86\% of
   the species, demonstrating the resilience of this layer to fire. Only
   one ruderal species was disadvantaged by fire and 13\% of the species
   benefited. Rapid recovery of soil cover by native vegetation in burned
   areas was driven by species with high capacity to resprout and spread
   vegetatively. Recovery of the savanna ground-layer community, as a
   whole, resulted from a combination of different species traits. We
   summarized these traits into five large groups, encompassing key
   strategies involved in ground-layer regeneration after fire. Synthesis.
   Fire dramatically changes the ground layer of savanna vegetation in the
   short term, but the system is highly resilient, quickly recovering the
   pre-fire state. Recovery involves different strategies, which we
   categorized into five functional groups of plant
   species:grasses,seeders,bloomers,undergroundersandresprouters. Knowledge
   of these diverse strategies should be used as a tool to assess
   conservation and restoration status of fire-resilient ecosystems in the

Abstract = {{Long-term faunal responses to restoration efforts can be very different
   from those in the short term, but are often not quantified
   systematically to identify ways that maximise restoration outcomes. We
   report on a 9-year landscape-scale ecological experiment that tests the
   long-term responses of reptile populations to coarse woody debris (CWD)
   addition, reduced native macropod grazing, and prescribed fire. We found
   that reptile species richness was increased 9years after CWD addition,
   as was the abundance of several common reptile species. Further, the
   more CWD was added to the system, the more benefits were afforded to
   reptiles. The positive effect of CWD depended on the surrounding
   vegetation structure and was greater in sites with low tree and shrub
   cover. Further, lower levels of macropod grazing appeared to lessen the
   effects of CWD addition in the long term. Our results show that
   restoration projects in open woodlands and scattered tree ecosystems
   should consider the addition of CWD as a fundamental element of their
   management actions. To maximise benefits of CWD addition for reptiles,
   we recommend a strategy of placing CWD in areas with low tree and shrub
   cover rather than areas with high tree and shrub cover. The addition of
   CWD in such areas would provide crucial shelter and foraging substrates
   for reptiles in a comparatively hostile portion of the landscape. Our
   study helps to establish guidelines for achieving long-lasting effects

   of monitoring vertebrates over the long term.}},

   and Jeffrey pine-white fir stands (13-25 y) and upper montane red
   fir-white fir stands (14.5-19.5 y), intermediate in lodgepole pine
   stands (50-76.5 y), and longest in high-elevation red fir-mountain
   hemlock stands (100 y). Fire severity was mainly moderate to high in all
   forest structural groups except red fir-mountain hemlock. In the late
   19(th) century, large, mostly high-severity fires burned through all
   forests. Fire extent varied among structural groups, burning from 13\%

   few trees > 100 y old and peaks of establishment between 1895 and 1955

   recruitment followed the most recent (1883, 1885, 1889, 1918) large and

   understory density of shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant species and caused
   forest compositional shifts, particularly in lower-elevation Jeffrey
   pine-white fir and mixed conifer stands, and lodgepole pine stands on
   well-drained sites. Structural or compositional change is less
   pronounced in upper montane red fir-white fir and red fir-mountain

Abstract = {{Fine-scale ecological data collected across broad regions are becoming
   increasingly available. Appropriate geographic analyses of these data
   can help identify locations of ecological concern.
   We present one such approach, spatial association of scalable hexagons
   (SASH), which identifies locations where ecological phenomena occur at
   greater or lower frequencies than expected by chance. This approach is
   based on a sampling frame optimized for spatial neighborhood analysis,
   adjustable to the appropriate spatial resolution, and applicable to
   multiple data types.
   We divided portions of the United States into scalable equal-area
   hexagonal cells and, using three types of data (field surveys, aerial
   surveys, satellite imagery), identified geographic clusters of forested
   areas having high and low values for (1) invasive plant diversity and
   cover, (2) mountain pine beetle-induced tree mortality, and (3) wildland
   forest fire occurrences.
   Using the SASH approach, we detected statistically significant patterns
   of plant invasion, bark beetle-induced tree mortality, and fire
   occurrence density that will be useful for understanding macroscale
   patterns and processes associated with each forest health threat, for
   assessing its ecological and economic impacts, and for identifying areas
   where specific management activities may be needed.
   The presented method is a ``big data{''} analysis tool with potential
   application for macrosystems ecology studies that require rigorous

   standard component of annual national reports on forest health status

Abstract = {{Fire regimes are changing throughout the world. Changed fire patterns
   across northern Australian savannas have been proposed as a factor
   contributing to recent declines of small- and medium-sized mammals.
   Despite this, few studies have examined the mechanisms that underpin how
   species use habitat in fire-affected landscapes. We determined the
   habitats and resources important to the declining golden-backed tree-rat
   (Mesembriomys macrurus) in landscapes partially burnt by recent intense
   fire. We aimed to (i) compare the relative use of rainforest and savanna
   habitats; (ii) examine the effect of fire history on use of savanna
   habitats; and (iii) identify key foraging and denning resources. Habitat
   selection was examined by comparing the availability of eight habitat
   types around real (used) and generated (available) location points.
   Individuals used a range of habitats, but consistently selected long
   unburnt rainforest in preference to recently burnt savanna (1-12 months
   post-fire); however, recently burnt savanna was used in preference to
   long unburnt savanna. Tree-rats foraged in Terminalia hadleyana,
   Planchonia rupestris, Celtis philippensis and Owenia vernicosa, tree
   species that are found in a variety of habitat types. Individuals used a
   range of den sites, including cliffs, trees, logs, scree and stags found
   throughout the study area. Although multiple factors may have led to the
   decline of Mes.macrurus across its range, these results are consistent
   with the idea that changes in the savanna structure as a consequence of
   contemporary fire patterns could also have a role. The continued
   persistence of Mes.macrurus in the northwest Kimberley may be supported
   by land management strategies that conserve fruiting and hollow-bearing
   trees, and maintain the availability of fire-sensitive vegetation types.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used widely to manage grasslands on National Wildlife
   Refuges and other public lands in the northern Great Plains, but its
   effects on habitat use or production of wildlife in the region are
   poorly understood. During 1998-2003, we used point counts to examine
   effects of prescribed fire on vegetation and passerines in a mixed-grass
   prairie complex in north-central North Dakota, USA (n 5 7 units, each
   40-70 ha). Vegetation structure and, to a lesser extent, plant community
   composition varied with year of study (likely related to changes in
   annual precipitation) and with number of growing seasons since fire.
   Fire altered plant structure, especially the amount of residual
   vegetation, which in turn influenced bird species richness and
   abundance. The number of indicated pairs for sedge wren (Cistothorus
   platensis), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), Le Conte's sparrow
   (Ammodramus leconteii), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis),
   and bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) were lowest during the first
   postfire growing season but generally increased and stabilized within
   2-3 postfire growing seasons. Our results support the premise that
   grassland passerines are well-adapted to frequent, periodic fires,
   generally corresponding to those occurring prior to Euro-American
   settlement of the region. Prescribed fire is important for reducing tree
   and shrub invasion, restoring biological integrity of plant communities,
   and maintaining or enhancing populations of grassland-dependent bird
   species. Managers in the northern mixed-grass prairie region should not
   be overly concerned about reductions in bird abundances that are limited
   mostly to the first growing season after fire.}},

Title = {{Projected Climate-Fire Interactions Drive Forest to Shrubland Transition
   on an Arizona Sky Island}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Climate stressors on the forests of the American Southwest are shifting
   species distributions across spatial scales, lengthening potential fire
   seasons, and increasing the incidence of drought and insect-related
   die-off. A legacy of fire exclusion in forests once adapted to frequent
   surface fires is exacerbating these changes. Reducing stand densities
   and surface fuel loads has been proposed as a means of moderating fire
   behavior while reducing competition for water, but it is not established
   whether thinning treatments and restoration of surface fire regimes will
   be enough to offset the multiple manifestations of a changing climate.
   We examined the potential for prescribed fuel treatments and restoration
   of historical fire frequencies to mitigate the effects of climate on
   forest species distributions, composition, total biomass, and fire
   severity. We used an ecosystem process model to simulate the effects of
   projected climate, fire, and active management interactions along an
   ecological gradient of shrublands, woodlands, and forests on a mountain
   range in Arizona in the United States. We used historical climate
   conditions as a baseline to compare results from projected climate for
   the period 2005-2055 with and without fire and with no fuel treatments,
   a single-entry fuel treatment, and a second fuel treatment after 20
   years. Simulated desert grassland and shrub communities remained
   compositionally stable and maintained or expanded their extents while
   woodland and forest communities lost basal area and total biomass and
   receded to the coolest and wettest aspects and drainages even without
   fire. Initial fuel treatments reduced the extent and relative mortality
   of high-severity patches for the first two decades, and secondary
   treatments at simulation year 20 extended these effects for the
   remaining 30 years of simulation. Immediate and future fuel treatments
   showed potential to mitigate the severity of fire effects under
   projected conditions and slow the transition from forest to shrubland in
   some vegetation types, however, a reduction in basal area and spatial
   extent of some forest species occurred regardless of management actions.
   Results are being used to inform local land managers and partners of
   potential landscape changes resulting from climate alone and from
   climate-fire interactions and to coordinate active management of fuels
   across ownerships.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying factors that underlie invasive species colonisation and
   change in density could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of
   biological invasions and for invasive species management. We examined a
   suite of factors potentially influencing the landscape-level invasion of
   Lantana camara L., one of the most ubiquitous invasive species in South
   Asia. These factors included disturbance factors like forest fires,
   historical habitat modification, and edge effects, in addition to
   factors like propagule pressure and habitat suitability. We examined the
   relative importance of these factors on the colonisation and change in
   density of L. camara in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve,
   Western Ghats, India. We used extensive (1997-2008) datasets tracking
   the presence and abundance of L. camara and combined these with
   corresponding data on disturbances, propagule pressure, and habitat
   suitability. We used an information-theoretic model selection approach
   to determine the relative importance of each factor on the colonisation
   and change in density of L. camara. Colonisation was mainly a function
   of proximity to already established populations (i.e. propagule
   pressure), whereas increase in L. camara density appeared to be
   constrained by high fire frequency. Research and management efforts need
   to recognize the multidimensional nature of mechanisms underlying L.

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{224}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is needed to counter global-scale ecosystem
   degradation, but can conflict with endangered species conservation when
   restoration impacts habitat quality. In such cases, prioritizing
   long-vacant patches for restoration is an intuitively appealing strategy
   for minimizing the effects on endangered species. Metapopulation models
   grounded in empirical data potentially provide a rigorous framework for
   developing theoretical ``patch vacancy thresholds{''} (i.e., duration of
   vacancy required before implementing restoration) and assessing the
   implications of such criteria for restoration objectives. We develop
   such a model for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), which embody the
   species-ecosystem dilemma given their preference for closed-canopy
   forests that are also susceptible to severe fire and drought and hence
   the center of debates about forest restoration intended to reduce fire
   and drought risk. We leveraged a > 20-year territory occupancy dataset
   to parameterize a Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM) to assess
   relative risk to a metapopulation of owls in California under
   alternative conservation guidelines, including a range of vacancy
   thresholds. Territories with greater amounts of owl habitat were more
   likely to be recolonized and less likely to go extinct. Importantly, the
   probability of a vacant owl territory becoming recolonized declined as
   length of vacancy increased; territories vacant for 1 and 10 years had
   annual recolonization probabilities of 0.34 and 0.06, respectively.
   Based on our SPOM, projected territory occupancy rates declined as the
   vacancy threshold decreased and as habitat within territories was
   impacted by restoration. However, more liberal territory vacancy
   thresholds were projected to increase the proportion of territories (and
   thus landscape) that could be restored and that restored conditions
   could be maintained with repeated treatments. Reintroducing natural
   disturbance regimes, which eliminated the need for repeated treatments,
   was projected to reduce risk to owls, particularly with relaxed vacancy
   thresholds. We provide a simple, yet novel, metapopulation framework for
   quantifying how alternative conservation guidelines might impact owl
   occupancy and influence forest restoration guidelines. Similar analyses
   could facilitate restoration efforts in other systems by more explicitly
   quantifying tradeoffs between species-ecosystem objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The Carpentarian rock-rat (Zyzomys palatalis) is a critically endangered
   endemic rodent known from only four sandstone gorges in the southeast
   Gulf of Carpentaria, Northern Territory, Australia. These gorges harbour
   thickets of monsoon rainforest and broadleaf woodland, surrounded by a
   Eucalypt savanna matrix. The long-term persistence of Z. palatalis is
   threatened by altered fire regimes, grazing by feral animals and stock,
   weed intrusion, and the stochastic hazards associated with small,
   fragmented populations. To assess the relative importance of these
   threats and develop practical management options, a population and
   habitat simulation model was developed, based on the best existing data.
   Population viability was predicted to be highly sensitive to the
   frequency of hot, late dry-season fires. Progressive habitat degradation
   (due predominantly to intense late dry-season fires) is likely to
   substantially reduce population size and lead to the probable extinction
   of the species within the next 100 years. The most effective management
   strategy to counteract this threat would be regular, controlled, fuel
   reduction bums in the vegetation around the gorge entrances during the
   early dry season. Establishing a new population (through translocation
   of captive-bred individuals) would not appreciably reduce extinction
   risk, but could provide valuable additional data on the impact of
   threats, if conducted as an adaptive management experiment. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Despite historically dominating many landscapes of the southeastern
   United States, old-growth stands of southern pine (Pinus palustris, P.
   elliottii var. densa, P. elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii, P. echinata,
   and P. taeda) are extremely rare and have high ecological value, but may
   be underrepresented and mischaracterized due to small fragment size and
   restrictive definitions. Such misunderstanding is a barrier to future
   old-growth management and conservation. To quantify, characterize, and
   conserve these remnants, we conducted inventories for five species of
   old-growth southern pines on 16 sites across similar to 44,110 forested
   ha managed by the Florida Park Service. We used characteristics of
   old-growth pines and forests from the literature to locate potential
   sites and assess status and threats. This inventory documented 4697.5 ha
   of old-growth southern pines in 16 parks throughout Florida. The median
   size stand we inventoried or included due to existing documentation is
   121 ha, with stands as small as eight ha and as large as 2020 ha.
   Despite their small relative extent, these stands harbor rare,
   threatened, or endangered species and represent significant conservation
   areas in the region. A threat common to most of the old-growth stands in
   Florida State Parks is complications from reintroduction of prescribed
   fire following prolonged fire exclusion. Heavy fuel loading and invasion
   of off-site species has resulted in high post-fire mortality linked to
   both forest floor duff consumption and overstory crown consumption.
   Management measures are presented to improve conditions of old-growth
   southern pines in Florida State Parks, and have relevance to broader

Abstract = {{I used litterfall sampling to estimate the biomass, diversity, and
   community structure of epiphytic lichens in three dry forest cover types
   in the eastern Washington Cascade range. Cover types represented a
   temperature/moisture and stand structural complexity gradient. Lichen
   litterfall biomass increased with increasing stand complexity and
   moisture. Lichen litterfall biomass was 3.42 kg/ha in open pine stands,
   7.51 kg/ha in young mixed-species stands, 8.55 kg/ha in mature
   mixed-species stands. Six species accounted for 63\% of the total sample
   biomass: Bryoria capillaris (20.2\%), Hypogymnia imshaugii (15.8\%),
   Letharia vulpina (14.5\%), B. fremontii (7.2\%), Nodobryoria abbreviata
   (2.8\%), and Alectoria sarmentosa (2.6\%). Bryoria tortuosa, considered
   rare in most of its range, was relatively common in young forest.
   Epiphytic lichen species richness and dominance did not differ among the
   three forest cover types. Lichen associations differed, however, among
   cover types. The dominant lichen in open pine stands was L vulpina,
   followed by Bryoria spp., H. imshaugii, and L columbiana. Vulpicida
   canadensis and L. columbiana were weak indicator species. Young stands
   were dominated by H. imshaugii, a strong indicator species of young
   stands, followed by B. capillaris and L. vulpina. Cetraria platyphylla
   and C. pallidula also were strong indicator species of young stands.
   Mature stands were overwhelmingly dominated by Bryoria species,
   primarily B. capillaris and B. fremontii, both strong indicators of
   mature stands. A. sarmentosa, H. imshaugii, and L. vulpina were other
   moderately abundant species. Alectoria imshaugii was also a strong
   indicator species of mature forest. Impacts on epiphytic lichens of dry
   forest management options that reduce stand density in fire-suppressed
   stands might vary. Lichens associated with dry open conditions would
   presumably benefit. The impact on species associated with old or moist
   conditions, especially forage lichens, might be lessened by
   variable-density thinning and other practices that maintain open- and
   closed-canopy patchiness and large trees. That patchiness might be hard
   to maintain with a maintenance program of understory burning patterned
   after natural fire regimes. At landscape scales, however, long-term
   persistence of forage and other lichens associated with mature moist
   forest would be enhanced by restoration of stable fire regimes.

Abstract = {{Many animal species exhibit broad-scale latitudinal or longitudinal
   gradients in their response to biotic and abiotic components of their
   habitat. Although knowing the underlying mechanism of these patterns can
   be critical to the development of sound measures for the preservation or
   recovery of endangered species, few studies have yet identified which
   processes drive the existence of geographical gradients in habitat
   selection. Using extensive spatial data of broad latitudinal and
   longitudinal extent, we tested three hypotheses that could explain the
   presence of geographical gradients in landscape selection of the
   endangered boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) during
   winter in Eastern Canadian boreal forests: 1) climate-driven selection,
   which postulates that geographic gradients are surrogates for climatic
   gradients; 2) road-driven selection, which proposes that boreal caribou
   adjust their selection for certain habitat classes as a function of
   proximity to roads; and 3) an additive effect of both roads and climate.
   Our data strongly supported road-driven selection over climate
   influences. Thus, direct human alteration of landscapes drives boreal
   caribou distribution and should likely remain so until the climate
   changes sufficiently from present conditions. Boreal caribou avoided
   logged areas two-fold more strongly than burnt areas. Limiting the
   spread of road networks and accounting for the uneven impact of logging
   compared to wildfire should therefore be integral parts of any habitat
   management plan and conservation measures within the range of the
   endangered boreal caribou. The use of hierarchical spatial models
   allowed us to explore the distribution of spatially-structured errors in
   our models, which in turn provided valuable insights for generating
   alternative hypotheses about processes responsible for boreal caribou
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Many small mammal species experience population declines following
   prescribed fire, presumably resulting from increased predation due to
   lack of cover. However, Peromyscus gossypinus (Cotton Mouse) typically
   shows a neutral or positive population response following fire. Because
   they typically spend diurnal hours in below-ground refuges, Cotton Mice
   may be less susceptible to predation following fire than other small
   mammals. We examined the effects of prescribed fire and exclusion of
   mammalian predators on selection of daytime refuges by Cotton Mice. We
   located daytime refuges of 12 radiotagged Cotton Mice in a fenced
   mesomammal-predator (hereafter, mesopredator) exclosure (23 refuge
   locations) and 9 Cotton Mice in an adjacent unfenced control plot (13
   refuge locations) for one month prior to and one month after a
   prescribed fire in winter 2007. Refuge locations included Gopherus
   polyphemus (Gopher Tortoise) burrows (27.8\%), other ground holes
   (44.4\%), stump holes (25.0\%), and holes at the base of trees (2.8\%).
   Fire had little effect on refuge selection, likely because Cotton Mice
   primarily used below-ground refuges, which allowed them to avoid the
   direct effects of fire and predation following fire. Structure near the
   refuge, including burrows, stumps, and coarse woody debris, was
   important in selection of daytime refuges and was particularly important
   in the presence of mesopredators.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic diseases have fundamentally altered the structure and function of
   forest ecosystems. Controlling exotic diseases across large expanses of
   forest has proven difficult, but fire may reduce the levels of diseases
   that are sensitive to environmental conditions. We examined Cornus
   florida populations in burned and unburned Quercus-Carya stands to
   determine if burning prior to anthracnose infection has reduced the
   impacts of an exotic fungal disease, dogwood anthracnose, caused by
   Discula destructiva. We hypothesized that fire has altered stand
   structure and created open conditions less conducive to dogwood
   anthracnose. We compared C. florida density, C. florida health, and
   species composition and density among four sampling categories: unburned
   stands, and stands that had burned once, twice, and 3 times over a
   20-year period (late 1960s to late 1980s). Double burn stands contained
   the greatest density of C. florida stems (770 stems ha(-1)) followed by
   triple burn stands (233 stems ha(-1)), single burn stands (225 stems
   ha(-1)) and unburned stands (70 stems ha(-1); P < 0.01). We observed
   less crown dieback in small C. florida trees (< 5 cm diameter at breast
   height) in burned stands than in unburned stands (P < 0.05). Indicator
   species analysis showed that burning favored species historically
   associated with Quercus-Carya forests and excluded species associated
   with secondary succession following nearly a century of fire
   suppression. Our results suggest that fire may mitigate the decline of
   C. florida populations under attack by an exotic pathogen by altering
   forest structure and composition. Further, our results suggest that the
   burns we sampled have had an overall restorative effect on forest
   communities and were within the fire return interval of the historic
   fire regime. Consequently, prescribed fire may offer a management tool
   to reduce the impacts of fungal disease in forest ecosystems that
   developed under historic burning regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's recent recovery plan for one of the
   most carefully watched threatened species worldwide, the Northern
   Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), recommended a major departure
   in conservation strategies in the northwestern United States. Due to
   concern about fire, the plan would switch from a reserve to a no-reserve
   strategy in up to 52\% of the owl's range. Fuel treatments (e.g.,
   thinning) at regular intervals also would occur on up to 65-70\% of dry
   forests in this area. Estimations of fire risk, however, were based on
   less than a decade of data and an anecdotal assessment of a single,
   large fire. We found that decadal data are inherently too short, given
   infrequent large fires, to accurately predict fire risk and trends.
   Rates of high-severity fire, based on remote-sensing data, are far lower
   than reported in the plan and in comparison with the rate of old-forest
   recruitment. In addition, over a 22-year period, there has been no
   increase in the proportion of high-severity fire. Our findings refute
   the key conclusions of the plan that are the basis for major changes in
   conservation strategies for the Spotted Owl. The best available science
   is needed to address these strategies in an adaptive-management
   framework. From the standpoint of fire risk, there appears to be ample
   time for research on fire and proposed treatment effects on Spotted Owls
   before designing extensive management actions or eliminating reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important management tool to reduce fuel loads, to
   remove non-fire adapted species and to sustain fire-adapted taxa in many
   forested ecosystems of the southeastern USA. Yet, the long-term effects
   of recurring prescribed fires on soil fungi and their communities in
   these ecosystems remain unclear. We Illumina MiSeq sequenced and
   analyzed fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS2) amplicons from a
   long-term prescribed burn experiment that has implemented different
   regimes for nearly a quarter century to evaluate the effects of
   differing prescribed fire intervals and the season of their
   implementation on soil-inhabiting fungal communities. Unburned plots
   were used as a reference to represent the compositional state resulting
   from fire suppression. Our data show that while the recurring burning or
   the season of the prescribed burning do not affect richness and
   diversity of the fungal communities, the frequent (two and three year
   interval) fires maintain a fire-adapted community that is distinct from
   those in unburned reference plots. Subsequent indicator taxon analyses
   identified a total of 37 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were
   more frequent in the frequently implemented burns and 26 OTUs that were
   more frequent in the fire suppressed treatment. We conclude that
   frequent prescribed burning maintains fire selected soil fungal
   communities that may support plant communities that are composed of
   desired fire adapted or fire tolerant species that dominate the
   frequently burned areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{41-48}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Tallgrass prairie, arguably the most fire-dependent system in North
   America, is a Biome that has been essentially eliminated and is now
   exceedingly rare. Absent frequent disturbance, remnant tallgrass prairie
   rapidly converts to a dominant cover of woody plants. This creates
   unique challenges for conservation of prairie-specialist insects
   dependent on increasingly small and isolated habitats prone to direct
   and indirect threats from climate variability, habitat degradation, and
   management activities; or lack thereof. Regal fritillary butterflies
   (Speyeria idalia) exemplify this problem, with sharp population declines
   in recent decades and considerable disagreement on management practices,
   particularly in the use of prescribed burning to maintain habitat.
   Spanning 20-years (1997-2016), we evaluated regal fritillary populations
   within seven sites in relation to fire, habitat, and climate records to
   better understand these interacting effects on interannual and long-term
   population changes. Though fire had short-term negative effects on regal
   fritillary abundance, habitat quality was one of the most important
   factors explaining populations and was positively associated with
   prescribed fire. Burning every 3-5 years maximized regal fritillary
   abundance, but even annual burning was more beneficial to regal
   populations than no burning at all. Unburned refugia are important in
   maintaining populations, but creating and maintaining high quality
   habitat with abundant violets (Viola spp) and varied nectar sources, may
   be the most impactful management and conservation tool. Regal fritillary
   butterflies were consistently more than twice as abundant on high
   quality habitats and this relationship held across, and often dwarfed
   the effects of, various prescribed fire regimes or climate variability.}},

Abstract = {{Although wildfires are occurring frequently in the pine-oak forests in
   the Sierra Madre Oriental (northeastern Mexico), data on post-fire
   succession and forest structure are still rare. Our objectives were to
   (1) assess the changes in woody plant species composition after fire and
   to (2) to relate successional patterns to environmental variability.
   Based on their fire history 23 plots were selected in the Parque
   Ecologico, Chipinque (PECH). Changes in forest structure across the
   chronosequence of turned stands were deduced from density, height and
   diameter measurements of trees and shrubs (>5 cm in diameter) in all
   plots Of 1000 m(2). Differences in woody plant species composition among
   the plots were evaluated using Shannon evenness measure and the
   Whittaker's measure and by Hierarchical cluster analysis and Detrended
   Correspondence Analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a high
   similarity among all recently burned plots, indepencled of the aspect.
   Multivariate analysis showed that local environmental factors, including
   time since fire, continue to structure species composition. Oak species
   (mainly Quercus rysophylla) resprouted successfully after fire and
   dominated young post-fire stands. Pine species (Pinus pseudotrobus and
   Pinus teocote) only appeared 18 years after fire and were the dominating
   species in mature stands (62 years after fire). In contrast, woody plant
   species composition in older stands tended also to be influenced by
   factors such as aspect and by the potential solar radiation (PSR) during
   the growing season. The results demonstrate that in the PECH, natural
   regeneration is sufficient and woody plant species composition will be
   similar to pre-fire conditions after 60 years of succession. We conclude
   that the park managers should consider incorporating natural disturbance
   regimes into their management practices.(C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Low-elevation ponderosa pine ecosystems of the inland northwestern
   United States experienced frequent, low-severity fire that promoted open
   stands dominated by large diameter ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa).
   Fire exclusion has led to increased stand densities, often due to
   proliferation of less fire-tolerant species and an increased risk of
   stand-replacing wildfire. These fundamental changes have spurred
   interest in forest restoration treatments, including thinning,
   prescribed burning and thinning combined with prescribed burning. We
   examined the response of numerous soil physical, chemical and biological
   parameters to these treatments 1 and 3 years post-treatment, using a
   replicated field experiment. Individual restoration treatments were
   implemented in 9 ha units. We observed significantly lower C:N in the O
   horizon and higher O horizon and mineral soil NH4+ concentrations in
   both BURN and THIN/BURN treatments during year 1. Soil NH4+ remained
   elevated through year 3 in the THIN/BURN treatment. Net N
   mineralization, nitrification and NO3- concentration were significantly
   greater in the THIN/BURN than all other treatments during year 1 and net
   nitrification rates remained elevated through year 3. A high C:N
   substrate decomposed more rapidly in both BURN treatments relative to
   the unburned treatments. Treatments had no immediate effect on the soil
   microbial community; however, phospholipid fatty acid profiles differed
   16-18 weeks following treatments due to higher actinomycetes in the
   THIN/BURN treatment. The large scale of our treatment units resulted in
   significant variation in fire severity among prescribed bums as a
   function of variation in fuel quantity and distribution, and weather
   conditions during burn days. Correlation analysis revealed that
   variation in fine fuel consumed was tightly correlated with net N
   mineralization and net nitrification. These differences in soil
   characteristics may influence stand productivity and understory species
   composition in the future. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Removal of fire-killed trees (i.e. post-fire or salvage logging) is
   often conducted in part to reduce woody fuel loads and mitigate
   potential reburn effects. Studies of post-salvage fuel dynamics have
   primarily used chronosequence or modelling approaches, with associated
   limitations; longitudinal studies tracking fuels over time have been
   rare. We resampled a network of post-fire plots, comprising a range of
   logging intensities, 10 years after the 2002 Biscuit Fire (Oregon, USA).
   For surface woody fuels, which started from large treatment differences
   immediately following logging (stepwise increases with harvest
   intensity), we found converging trends among treatments at 10 years,
   with convergence nearly complete for fine fuels but not for coarse
   fuels. Fire-killed snags for the dominant species (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii) decayed while standing at a statistically significant rate
   (single-exponential k=0.011), similar to or only slightly slower than
   down wood, suggesting that not all snag biomass will reach the forest
   floor. Live vegetation (largely resprouting sclerophyllous vegetation)
   is beginning to dominate surface fuel mass and continuity (>100\% cover)
   and likely moderates differences associated with woody fuels. Post-fire
   logging had little effect on live fuels or their change over time,
   suggesting high potential for stand-replacing early-seral fire
   regardless of post-fire harvest treatments.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a national experiment, the Fire and Fire Surrogate Project,

   this hypothesis, as we documented predicted positive responses to

Abstract = {{Fire has long shaped biological responses of plants and plant
   communities in many ecosystems; yet, uncontrolled wildfire frequently
   puts people and infrastructure at risk. Fuel or hazard reduction burning
   outside of the historic fire season is a common and widespread practice
   aimed at reducing the risk of high-severity fires, which ideally also
   considers biodiversity values. Within fire-prone systems, seed banks are
   critical for plant species' regeneration, and seeds are typically
   adapted to survive the passage of fire and to regenerate in response to
   cues associated with historic fire regimes. However, species-specific
   tolerances to the heat from fire exist; likely influenced by a range of
   physical, physiological, and morphological seed traits, which may differ
   between seasons. The identification of these tolerances and associated
   seed traits may inform fire and species management. We determined the
   lethal temperatures for seeds in relation to their moisture content, and
   other key traits that we hypothesised may be associated with survival.
   Seeds from 14 native species and 4 species non-native to fire-prone
   Mediterranean climate Banksia woodlands of south-west Western Australia
   were exposed to temperatures between 50 and 180 degrees C for 3 min at
   three different moisture contents. The temperature at which half the
   seeds were killed (T-50) was estimated using nonlinear modelling. Seed
   mass, seed shape, embryo type, plant resprouting ability, seed storage
   syndrome, and native/non-native status were quantified and modelled for
   their relationship with T-50. Increased moisture content was a
   significant predictor of elevated seed mortality. Seeds with higher
   moisture (95\% relative humidity {[}RH]) content perished at much lower
   temperatures. Seeds with low moisture content (15\% or 50\% RH) were
   able to survive significantly higher temperatures (median increase of 38
   and 31 degrees C higher respectively). Seeds with basal embryos showed
   significantly lower T-50 than other embryo types. Synthesis. Seeds with
   elevated moisture contents have lower lethal temperature thresholds,
   leading to increased seed mortality during fire events when seeds (and
   soils) are moist. Thermal tolerance varied among coexisting species
   within this fire-prone system. These data suggest potential concern for
   the impacts of aseasonal burning practices (i.e., cool/wet season
   burning), and highlight the importance of taking seed moisture content
   into account when planning and implementing prescribed burning.}},

Title = {{Does nest-site selection influence bobwhite nesting success in south
   Florida?}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{489-496}},
Abstract = {{Context. Nest-site selection can influence nesting success, and thus
   population dynamics, of many species of ground-nesting birds. Despite
   the economic importance as a game species, populations of northern
   bobwhites have been declining throughout the southern United States.
   This paper reports the nesting ecology of northern bobwhites (Colinus
   virginianus) on Babcock-Webb Wildlife Management Area, Florida, USA, and
   illustrates the influence of landscape composition and structure on
   bobwhite nest-site selection and nest fate.
   Aim. To investigate nest-site selection by bobwhites, to evaluate the
   influence of landscape composition and structure on nest-site selection,
   and to identify factors influencing nesting success.
   Methods. We used distance-based habitat-selection methods and logistic
   regression to test for nest-site selection and to investigate the
   influence of landscape characteristics on nesting success.
   Key results. Bobwhites preferred to establish nests closer to food plots
   and farther away from water bodies than expected; other habitats were
   neither preferred nor avoided. Nesting success did not vary across
   years, differ among habitats or among burn treatments, and none of the
   habitat and landscape variables we measured significantly influenced the
   probability that a nest would be successful.
   Conclusions. Bobwhites preferred to place nests closer to food plots.
   However, habitat features of nest sites did not influence bobwhite
   nesting success. These results may indicate that random nest predation
   by meso-mammalian predators may currently determine fates of bobwhite
   nests in south Florida, or that population density is low enough that
   only suitable nesting sites are occupied.
   Implications. Our results suggest that increasing the density of linear
   food plots, and maintaining a structurally diverse pine-palmetto and dry
   prairie habitat that provides adequate nesting cover could contribute to
   augmenting bobwhite nesting habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of prescribed burning for conservation management of plant
   communities is controversial for moorlands growing on peat. These
   ecosystems provide many services that may be damaged by fire, hence it
   is important to fully assess its impact on all aspects of ecosystem
   structure and function experimentally over relatively long time-scales.
   This paper describes change in community composition, major plant
   species, and plant functional types on moorland on peat in upland
   Britain over 60years subject to 3 burning treatments after an initial
   burn in 1954/1955: no further burn and burning at 10- and 20-year
   intervals (all +/- sheep grazing). Data were analysed using multivariate
   and univariate methods. Vegetation composition and individual species
   abundance reflected the degree of disturbance. The least disturbed was
   dominated by Calluna vulgaris and pleurocarpous mosses, whereas the most
   disturbed treatment (burned every 10years) had greater Eriophorum
   vaginatum, Sphagnum spp., acrocarpous mosses, liverworts, and lichens.
   The 20-year treatment was intermediate in response disturbance. Repeated
   burning increased species abundance-weighted Ellenberg values for
   moisture, reaction, light through time, and fertility; the exception was
   the 10-year rotation for fertility. These confirm that prescribed
   burning is not deleterious to peat-forming species (Eriophorum spp. and
   Sphagnum spp.), indeed these species were found in greater abundance in
   frequently burned treatments. It also confirms that a no-burn policy
   will lead to increasing dominance ofC.vulgaris, a flammable,
   fire-adapted shrub, which increases summer wildfire risk. These results
   inform conservation management policy for moorland vegetation growing on
   peat; for this site, a 20-year prescribed burning rotation is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has been part of the North American boreal and cordilleran
   ecosystems for thousands of years. Because fire and harvesting compete
   directly for the same wood supply, and provinces have, within the last
   few decades, tended to reach their annual allowable cut, salvage logging
   has emerged as a practice to minimize the impact of fire on long-term
   wood supply. In most parts of the boreal and cordilleran forests,
   fire-killed boles rapidly degrade after their death, as wood-boring
   insects, stain, wood-decay fungi and checking lead to significant loss
   of grade or volume in the months following the fire. Because of this
   impending degradation, salvage operations are often hurried and other
   considerations, including the potential ecological impacts of salvage
   logging, have seldom been taken into consideration when defining
   harvesting strategies. The ecological consequences of rapid salvage have
   been widely studied only in the last 5 years, and it is now clear that
   salvage logging can have negative impacts on natural regeneration by
   seed, water quality, and fire-associated animal species. In this paper,
   we review both industrial and ecological constraints to salvage logging
   and discuss how both can be integrated in salvage plans. In particular,
   we focus on the issues of salvage timing and retention. At this point,
   some type of retention of merchantable stands, even if only for a few
   years, appears to be the only way to alleviate the negative ecological
   impacts of post-fire logging. On-site operational constraints, e.g.,
   stands that cannot be harvested due to lack of accessibility, represent
   an important starting point for any retention strategy.}},

Abstract = {{A key management objective for native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)
   forests in Scotland is to extend the forest onto treeless moorland,
   below the natural tree line, dominated by the dwarf shrub, heather
   (Calluna vulgaris). At Abernethy Forest, Scotland's largest native
   pinewood remnant, establishment of new tree seedlings on moorland has
   recently slowed despite the low grazing pressure. To investigate whether
   fire would be a useful management tool to improve the rate of
   regeneration of Scots pine, an experiment was carried out in 10 plots,
   on open moorland, on shallow peat soil, c 300 m from the forest edge. At
   each plot, 10 small exclosures were established, two for each of four
   burning treatments, and two controls. Within each exclosure, 100 Scots
   pine seeds were sown and the numbers of seedlings resulting were counted
   after 2, 11 and 30 months. Exclosures substantially reduced seed and
   seedling predation by mammals and invertebrates. The four burning
   treatments were single and double burns in the year of sowing, and
   single and double burns 1 year before sowing. Single burns removed
   largely heather, whilst second burns removed more of the moss. Burnt
   areas had 3.5 times (95\% confidence limits 1.5-8.1) the number of
   seedlings established as controls, 2 months after sowing. There was no
   significant additional effect on seedling numbers of either double
   burning or year of burn. Slower moving fires and, to some extent,
   shallower post-fire moss/litter depths, were associated with more
   seedlings establishing. Seedling numbers declined by 18\% between months
   2 and 11 and by 27\% between months 11 and 30. The pattern of these
   declines was not significantly affected by treatment, post-fire
   moss/litter depth, or fire characteristics. The results have wide
   application at sites where Scots pine regeneration is a management aim,
   particularly on heather moorland, and where techniques which mimic
   natural processes are preferred. Managers at such sites should include

Abstract = {{Many migratory grassland passerines complete their annual life cycle
   within the United States and investigations into wintering ecology of
   these species are scarce, particularly in ecoregions where habitat
   quality is considered to be compromised, such as the coastal prairie of
   Texas. During 2008-2010, we investigated wintering grassland bird
   ecology as related to coastal prairie composition and management
   practices on the mid-upper Texas coast. To quantify grassland bird
   composition and density among management regimes, we performed 260
   transect surveys on 40 different study site pastures deployed among 7
   different management regimes, varying in plant community composition as
   well as frequency (or occurrence) of burning, grazing, and mowing from
   29 October 2008-7 April 2009 and 17 November 2009-17 March 2010. A total
   of 79 bird species (48 species in 2008-2009 and 66 species in 2009-2010)
   were recorded during this study. Sites that were recently (<2 years
   prior) grazed, burned, or mowed tended to have the greatest species
   richness of obligate grassland bird species. Management regime and the
   resulting habitat characteristics also appeared to influence densities
   of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus
   platensis), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), with the former two
   species selecting areas that had not been recently burned, grazed, or
   mowed and were characterized by greater vertical vegetation density and
   litter depth, respectively. Conversely, Sprague's Pipit selected
   recently burned, grazed, or mowed prairies, characterized by less litter
   depth and percentage of shrubs nearby. More cosmopolitan species, such
   as Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) occurred equally among management regimes.
   Despite similar species richness in floristically disturbed sites,
   nonnative vegetation appeared to negatively influence species with
   specific habitat requirements such as Sprague's Pipit, Sedge Wren, and
   Le Conte's Sparrow. In order to increase wintering avian diversity,
   coastal prairie habitat conservation and management in Texas should
   focus on restoring management regimes (i.e., burning, mowing, and
   grazing) that create heterogeneous environments, while maintaining
   native vegetation communities.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a dominant feature of tropical savannas throughout the world,
   and provides a unique opportunity for habitat management at the
   landscape scale. We provide the background and methodology for a
   landscape-scale savanna fire experiment at Kapalga, located in Kakadu
   National Park in the seasonal tropics of northern Australia. The
   experiment addresses the limitations of previous savanna fire
   experiments, including inappropriately small sizes of experimental
   units, lack of replication, consideration of a narrow range of
   ecological responses and an absence of detailed measurement of fire
   behaviour. In contrast to those elsewhere in the world, Australia's
   savannas are sparsely populated and largely uncleared, with fires lit
   primarily in a conservation, rather than pastoral, context. Fire
   management has played an integral role in the traditional lifestyles of
   Aboriginal people, who have occupied the land for perhaps 50 000 years
   or more. Currently the dominant fire management paradigm is one of
   extensive prescribed burning early in the dry season (May-June), in
   order to limit the extent and severity of fires occurring later in the
   year. The ecological effects of different fire regimes are hotly
   debated, but we identify geo-chemical cycling, tree demography, faunal
   diversity and composition, phenology, and the relative importance of
   fire intensity, timing and frequency, as critical issues. Experimental
   units ('compartments') at Kapalga are 15-20 km(2) catchments, centred on
   seasonal creeks that drain into major rivers. Each compartment has been
   burnt according to one of four treatments, each replicated at least
   three times: `Early'--fires lit early in the dry season, which is the
   predominant management regime in the region; `Late'--fires lit late in
   the dry season, as occurs extensively in the region as unmanaged
   `wildfires'; `Progressive'--fires lit progressively throughout the dry
   season, such that different parts of the landscape are burnt as they
   progressively dry out (believed to approximate traditional Aboriginal
   burning practices); and `Unburnt'--no fires lit, and wildfires excluded.
   All burning treatments have been applied annually for 5 years, from 1990
   to 1994. Six core projects have been conducted within the experimental
   framework, focusing on nutrients and atmospheric chemistry, temporary
   streams, vegetation, insects, small mammals, and vertebrate predators.
   Detailed measurements of fire intensity have been taken to help
   interpret ecological responses. The Kapalga fire experiment is
   multidisciplinary, treatments have been applied at a landscape scale
   with replication, and ecological responses can be related directly to
   measurements of fire intensity. We are confident that this experiment
   will yield important insights into the fire ecology of tropical
   savannas, and will make a valuable contribution to their conservation
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Since European settlement, many granivorous birds of northern
   Australia's savanna landscapes have declined. One such example, the
   partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii), has suffered a significant range
   contraction, disappearing from at least half of its pre-European range.
   Multiple factors have been implicated in this decline, including the
   loss of traditional Aboriginal burning practices, grazing by large
   exotic herbivores and predation by feral cats (Felis catus). While
   populations of partridge pigeon on the Tiwi Islands may be particularly
   important for the long-term persistence of this species, they too may be
   at risk of decline. However, as a reliable method to detect this species
   has not yet been developed and tested, we lack the ability to identify,
   at an early stage, the species' decline in a given location or region.
   This severely limits our capacity to make informed management decisions.
   Here, we demonstrate that the standard camera trapping approach for
   native mammal monitoring in northern Australia attained an overall
   probability of detecting partridge pigeon greater than 0.98. We thus
   provide a robust estimate of partridge pigeon site occupancy (0.30) on
   Melville Island, the larger of the two main Tiwi Islands. The
   information presented here for the partridge pigeon represents a
   critical first step towards the development of optimal monitoring
   programmes with which to gauge population trajectories, as well as the
   response to remedial management actions. In the face of ongoing
   biodiversity loss, such baseline information is vital for management
   agencies to make informed decisions and should therefore be sought for
   as many species as possible.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{247}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades severe mammal declines have occurred in the vast and
   uncleared tropical savannas of northern Australia. Mounting evidence
   suggests that feral cats (Fells cams), large feral herbivores and
   increased frequency of high-severity fires, are all contributing to
   declines; however, the respective influence of each threat remains
   unclear. There is an urgent need to quantify the relative impacts of
   both `bottom-up' (i.e. the depletion of resources and habitat
   simplification from contemporary disturbance regimes) and `top-down'
   (i.e. increased predation pressure) factors on small mammal populations
   to inform where, and how, remedial conservation efforts should be
   targeted in northern Australia. We conducted an extensive survey of
   mammals across ca. 370,000 km(2) of monsoonal northern Australia using
   both camera-trapping and live-trapping methods. From multispecies
   occupancy models, we found that feral herbivore abundance, dingo
   abundance and feral cat occupancy were the best predictors of species
   richness of small (< 5500 g) mammals, with species richness declining as
   the respective pressures increased. Our results highlight that
   underlying productivity has seemingly enhanced the capacity of native
   mammals to withstand pressures, as species that have severely declined
   are now more likely to occur in areas with greater productivity. We
   suggest that a disturbance-driven reduction in habitat complexity and
   productivity has significantly disrupted bottom-up processes in northern
   Australia, subsequently increasing top-down pressure from predation,
   causing severe declines across much of the native mammal assemblage.
   Without maintaining, enhancing or recovering habitat condition in this
   region, long-term conservation and recovery of mammal diversity is
   unlikely.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1516-1524}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a common form of recurrent disturbance in many ecosystems, but
   ecological theory has a poor record of predicting animal responses to
   fire, at both species and assemblage levels. As a consequence, there is
   limited information to guide fire regime management for biodiversity
   conservation. We investigated a key research gap in the fire ecology
   literature; that is, the response of an anuran assemblage to variation
   in the fire return interval. We tested two hypotheses using a
   spatially-explicit fire database collected over a 40 year period: 1)
   species richness would peak at intermediate levels of disturbance. 2)
   Species with traits which enabled them to escape fire burrowing or
   canopy dwelling would be better able to survive fires, resulting in
   higher levels of occurrence in frequently burned sites. We found no
   evidence for either a reduction in species richness at locations with
   short fire return intervals, or a peak in species richness at
   intermediate levels of disturbance. Although we found some support for
   individual species responses to fire return intervals, these were
   inconsistent with the interpretation of burrowing or climbing being
   functional traits for fire-avoidance. Instead burrowing and climbing
   species may be more likely to be disadvantaged by frequent fire than
   surface dwelling frogs. More generally, our results show that many
   species in our study system have persisted despite a range of fire
   frequencies, and therefore that active management of fire regimes for
   anuran persistence may be unnecessary. The responses of anurans to fire
   in this location are unlikely to be predictable using simple
   life-history traits. Future work should focus on understanding the
   mechanistic underpinnings of fire responses, by integrating information
   on animal behavior and species ecological requirements.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{84-95}},
Abstract = {{We quantified the post-fire recovery of the endangered Eastern
   Bristlebird (Dasyornis brachypterus) at Booderee National Park,
   south-eastern Australia. Occurrence was recorded on 110 sites a year
   before, and for 3 years after a major unplanned fire in 2003. Although
   the Eastern Bristlebird is thought to be sensitive to wildfire, data
   indicated that the species either persisted continuously on burned sites
   or returned to previously occupied sites within 2 years. Post-fire site
   occupancy was associated with several factors: (1) pre-fire site
   occupancy; (2) vegetation type; (3) spatial heterogeneity in fire and
   the amount of unburned vegetation surrounding a site; and (4) site-level
   vegetation structure (e. g. diversity of understorey and midstorey
   plants). The most likely mechanism underpinning rapid re-occupancy was
   movement by resident birds to unburned parts elsewhere within their
   territories. The addition of intensive feral predator baiting within the
   present study suggests that predation may have a more important effect
   on populations after unplanned fires than formerly recognised. Our
   results have significant implications for fire management in areas where
   the Eastern Bristlebird occurs. Care should be taken with back-burning
   during unplanned fires and the spatial and temporal arrangement of
   prescribed fires to ensure unburned vegetation remains as refugia to
   facilitate bird persistence.}},

Abstract = {{1. Frequent and extensive burning practices coupled with intensive
   grazing management are known to impact negatively on the vegetation
   diversity of grassland ecosystems. Few studies have investigated the
   impacts on spider diversity and community structure as a result of these
   management practices, and no studies have been conducted in high
   mountain grasslands on how these spider assemblages are influenced by
   this form of management.
   2. Here, we present the results of a study conducted in the Mpumalanga
   grasslands on the eastern escarpment of South Africa. Ground-dwelling
   spiders were sampled in the summer season from 180 pit-fall traps in
   five study sites that varied from either being burnt annually and grazed
   heavily, burnt biennially and conservatively grazed, to communal land
   with no set management practice. Variations between sites were assessed
   and based on spider species composition and assemblage structure.
   3. A total of 1145 individuals were collected representing 86 species
   from 60 genera and 43 families. Our results show that a majority of
   genera in these grasslands were represented by very few individuals,
   where a total of 37 species were represented by singletons and 17
   species that were doubletons. The most abundant families were the
   Lycosidae (64.3\%), Gnaphosidae (9.0\%), Zodariidae (5.3\%), Linyphiidae
   (4.7\%) and Salticidae (3.1\%).
   4. Grazing intensity and fire frequency had no measurable effect on
   ground-dwelling spider abundance diversity or assemblage structure. Only
   when rare or single species occurrence was included, was there some form
   of association with sites. This study has provided for the first
   preliminary inventory of ground-dwelling spiders for this habitat.}},

Number = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Natural resource managers are often challenged with balancing
   requirements to maintain wildlife populations and to reduce risks of
   catastrophic or dangerous wildfires. This challenge is exemplified in
   the Sierra Nevada of California, where proposals to thin vegetation to
   reduce wildfire risks have been highly controversial, in part because
   vegetation treatments could adversely affect an imperiled population of
   the fisher (Martes pennanti) located in the southern Sierra Nevada. The
   fisher is an uncommon forest carnivore associated with the types of
   dense, structurally complex forests often targeted for fuel reduction
   treatments. Vegetation thinning and removal of dead-wood structures
   would reduce fisher habitat value and remove essential habitat elements
   used by fishers for resting and denning. However, crown-replacing
   wildfires also threaten the population's habitat, potentially over much
   broader areas than the treatments intended to reduce wildfire risks. To
   investigate the potential relative risks of wildfires and fuels
   treatments on this isolated fisher population, we coupled three spatial
   models to simulate the stochastic and interacting effects of wildfires
   and fuels management on fisher habitat and population size: a spatially
   dynamic forest succession and disturbance model, a fisher habitat model,
   and a fisher metapopulation model, which assumed that fisher fecundity
   and survivorship correlate with habitat quality. We systematically
   varied fuel treatment rate, treatment intensity, and fire regime, and
   assessed their relative effects on the modeled fisher population over 60
   years. After estimating the number of adult female fishers remaining at
   the end of each simulation scenario, we compared the immediate negative
   effects of fuel treatments to the longer-term positive effect of fuel
   treatment (via reduction of fire hazard) using structural equation
   modeling. Our simulations suggest that the direct, negative effects of
   fuel treatments on fisher population size are generally smaller than the
   indirect, positive effects of fuel treatments, because fuels treatments
   reduced the probability of large wildfires that can damage and fragment
   habitat over larger areas. The benefits of fuel treatments varied by
   elevation and treatment location with the highest net benefits to fisher
   found at higher elevations and within higher quality fisher habitat.
   Simulated fire regime also had a large effect with the largest net
   benefit of fuel treatments occurring when a more severe fire regime was
   simulated. However, there was large uncertainty in our projections due
   to stochastic spatial and temporal wildfires dynamic and fisher
   population dynamics. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of
   projecting future populations in systems characterized by large,
   infrequent, stochastic disturbances. Nevertheless, these coupled models
   offer a useful decision-support system for evaluating the relative
   effects of alternative management scenarios; and uncertainties can be
   reduced as additional data accumulate to refine and validate the models.}},

Abstract = {{Information about the immediate and potentially prolonged impacts of
   salvage logging is needed to develop prescriptions that maintain forest
   productivity, reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, and conserve
   biological communities. Most salvage logging studies have investigated
   post-fire salvage, often clearcutting, and impacts documented in these
   studies may be more severe than selective logging prescriptions applied
   to forests affected by beetle outbreaks. We evaluated the effects of
   selective salvage logging on avian nest survival in beetle-killed
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests on the Fremont and Winema
   National Forests, south-central Oregon, USA, 1997-1999. Using
   logistic-exposure models, we found that nest survival for weak (period
   nest survival: 0.64; 95\% CL: 0.50, 0.75) and strong (period nest
   survival: 0.71; 95\% CL: 0.46, 0.87) cavity nesters was significantly
   higher than for ground nesters (period nest survival: 0.31; 95\% CL:
   0.18, 0.46), while nest survival for open cup nesting birds (period nest
   survival: 0.57: 95\% CL: 0.47, 0.66) was intermediate. We did not find
   significant differences in nest survival for American robin (Turdus
   migratorius), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerine), dark-eyed junco
   (junco hyemalis), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), mountain
   chickadee (Poecile gambeli), or yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica
   coronata) (these six species comprised similar to 80\% of the sample).
   Our results suggest that, unlike post-fire salvage logging, selective
   harvesting prescriptions after beetle outbreaks may be suitable for
   meeting multiple management objectives, including generating a flow of
   commodities and maintaining avian nest survival rates. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Whooping crane (Grus americana), a rare and critically endangered
   species, are wetland dependent throughout their life cycle. The whooping
   crane's small population size, limited distribution, and wetland habitat
   requirements make them vulnerable to potential climate changes. Climate
   change predictions suggest overall temperature increases and significant
   changes in precipitation regimes throughout North America. At the
   individual level, temperature changes should have neutral to positive
   effects on thermoregulation and overall energy expenditure throughout
   the whooping crane's range. In the breeding grounds, earlier snow melt
   and increasing temperatures should improve food resources. However,
   increased precipitation and more extreme rainfall events could impact
   chick survival if rainfall occurs during hatching. Increased
   precipitation may also alter fire regimes leading to increased woody
   plant abundance thus reducing nesting habitat quality. During winter,
   higher temperatures will lead to a northward shifting of the freeze
   line, which will decrease habitat quality via invasion of black
   mangrove. Large portions of current winter habitat may be lost if
   predicted sea level changes occur. Stopover wetland availability during
   migration may decrease due to drier conditions in the Great Plains.
   Current and future conservation actions should be planned in light of

Title = {{Development and participatory evaluation of fireline intensity and flame
   property models for managed burns on Calluna-dominated heathlands}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Prescribed burning plays an important role in the management
   of many ecosystems and can also be used to mitigate landscape-scale fire
   risk. Safe and effective application of prescribed fire requires that
   managers have a robust understanding of potential fire behavior in order
   to decide on the appropriate tools and tactics for any burning
   operation. Shrubland ecosystems, including heaths and moors, are known
   to exhibit intense fire behavior under marginal burning conditions under
   which fire would not be expected to spread in other vegetation types.
   This makes developing fire behavior predictions for such systems
   important. Traditional managed burning is widely used as a tool in
   Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull-dominated heath and moorland landscapes in
   northwest Europe, but in some regions, especially the United Kingdom,
   there is significant debate over fire use. Despite the controversy,
   there is general agreement on the need to (1) understand relationships
   between fuel structure and potential fire behavior, and (2) improve
   burning practice to optimize potential trade-offs between different
   ecosystem services. Our aim was to provide knowledge to improve
   management practice by developing models of potential fireline intensity
   and flame length. We conducted 27 burns in three developmental stages of
   Calluna with different stand structures and estimated fireline
   intensity, flame length, flame height, and flame angle. Flame properties
   were assessed using photographs and visual observation. We evaluated our
   models using a participatory research approach for which conservation
   and land managers submitted basic observations on fire behavior and fire
   weather for their burns.
   Results: Fireline intensity and flame height increased significantly
   across age-related Calluna phases. Regression modeling revealed that
   fireline intensity could be adequately estimated by a combination of
   fuel height and wind speed, with taller fuels and higher wind speeds
   related to more intense fires. Predictions were, however, improved by
   accounting for live fuel moisture content. Flame length and height were
   modeled as a function of fireline intensity using standard approaches,
   but adequately performing models for flame angle could not be
   established. Evaluation data provided by land managers was noisy, but
   their qualitative assessments of fire behavior and estimates of flame
   length were significantly correlated with predictions from our models.
   Conclusions: Fire intensities and flame properties seen in northern
   Calluna heathlands are similar to those encountered in shrublands
   associated with climates and fuels more commonly perceived as
   representing high fire danger. The results demonstrated that our models
   perform tolerably well although there is substantial uncertainty in
   their predictions. The models were used to develop a fire behavior
   nomogram that can provide an indication of potential fireline intensity
   and flame length prior to commencing a burn.}},

Journal = {{EMU}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{79-88}},
Abstract = {{Measures of abundance and population trends are necessary for informed
   management of rare species, but obtaining reliable estimates of sparsely
   occurring species is an ongoing challenge in conservation biology. It is
   even more difficult when the species of interest is also cryptic. We
   censused a population of one such species, the Western Ground Parrot (
   Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris), over several years to develop a
   monitoring protocol to assist in future management, extend understanding
   of its response to fire, and provide a model that could be used with
   other cryptic bird species. Abundance of Western Ground Parrots,
   monitored by means of calling frequencies, varied from year to year at a
   study site in Fitzgerald River National Park, south- western Australia.
   Frequency of calling increased significantly from 1996 to 2000. During
   this time, frequency of calling peaked in 1998 in part of the study site
   that had been unburnt for more than 40 years, and remained high in 2000.
   Frequency of calling was similar in a more recently burnt part of the
   study area except in May 1998, when frequency was lower following a fire
   that burnt part of this area five months previously. Frequency of
   calling dropped significantly in both the long unburnt and recently
   burnt areas between 2000 and 2004; exact reasons for this are unknown.
   Western Ground Parrots can use recently burnt vegetation where it is
   immediately adjacent to an established population, but do not need fire
   to create habitat, at least in the timescale of 40 years. The current
   monitoring protocol, where eight listening posts are counted
   approximately three times each, is capable of detecting an annual change
   in frequency of calling of similar to 13\%. The number of listening
   posts would need to be increased to 14 in order to detect an annual
   change of 10\%, and would need to be increased to 40 in order to detect
   an annual change of 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Globally rare sandplain grassland and coastal heathland plant
   communities of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, merit high conservation
   priority because they support many rare and endangered species.
   Management (brush-cutting, grazing, and prescribed fire) has been
   effective in maintaining these communities, but less successful in
   transforming overgrown native scrub oak shrubland to diverse grassland.
   These scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia Wangenh.) communities may lack a
   seed bank of grassland species in their soil. To examine this on
   Nantucket, we used the seedling emergence method to compare the soil
   seed bank of grassland, heathland, and scrub oak sites. We classified
   seedlings by growth form (graminoid, forb, or woody) and identified them
   to genus and species when possible. We observed that seedling density
   declined along a successional gradient, with the highest total density
   and highest graminoid density at grassland sites and the lowest at one
   of the scrub oak sites. A nMDS ordination grouped grassland sites with
   dominant graminoids and heathland sites with dominant woody species and
   forbs. Seeds of key grassland dominants were absent from scrub oak and
   heathland samples but were found in grassland samples. Our results
   suggest that lack of seed bank of desirable grassland species may be a
   limiting factor in restoration projects intended to convert scrub oak
   shrubland to sandplain grassland. Scarcity of grassland species in the
   scrub oak seed bank highlights the importance of maintaining existing
   grassland communities, rather than attempting to restore them once they
   are gone.}},

   compared assemblages of saproxylic Coleoptera on dead, standing birch

   used trunk-window traps for sampling. Distinct beetle assemblages were
   associated with the different habitats. Median numbers of species or
   specimens caught did not differ between closed forests and clear-cuts,
   but individual beetle species occurred unevenly among the habitats.
   Several beetle species associated with open forest habitat, e.g. burned
   forests or storm-damage areas, including species regarded as threatened
   in Finland, were found almost exclusively, in clear-cuts.
   Correspondingly, a number of beetle species occurring frequently in
   closed forests were not found in clear-cuts. We conclude that dead
   trunks left in the clear-cut areas may host not only generalist
   saproxylic species but also many beetle species specialized to warm,

Title = {{Burning savanna for avian species richness and functional diversity}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used throughout fire-prone landscapes to conserve
   biodiversity. Current best practice in managing savanna systems
   advocates methods based on the assumption that increased fire-mediated
   landscape heterogeneity (pyrodiversity) will promote biodiversity.
   However, considerable knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of how
   savanna wildlife responds to the composition and configuration of
   pyrodiverse landscapes. The effects of pyrodiversity on functional
   diversity have rarely been quantified and assessing this relationship at
   a landscape scale that is commensurate with fire management is important
   for understanding mechanisms underlying ecosystem resilience. Here, we
   assess the impact of spatiotemporal variation in a long-term fire regime
   on avian diversity in North West Province, South Africa. We examined the
   relationship between (1) species richness, (2) three indices of
   functional diversity (i.e., functional richness, functional evenness,
   and functional dispersion) and four measures of pyrodiversity, the
   spatial extents of fire age classes, and habitat type at the landscape
   scale. We then used null models to assess differences between observed
   and expected functional diversity. We found that the proportion of newly
   burned (<1-yr post-fire), old, unburned (>= 10 yr post-fire), and
   woodland habitat on the landscape predicted species and functional
   richness. Species richness also increased with the degree of edge
   contrast between patches of varying fire age, while functional
   dispersion increased with the degree of patch shape complexity. Lower
   than expected levels of functional richness suggest that habitat
   filtering is occurring, resulting in functional redundancy across our
   study sites. We demonstrate that evaluating functional diversity and
   redundancy is an important component of conservation planning as they
   may contribute to previously reported fire resilience. Our findings
   suggest that it is the type and configuration, rather than the
   diversity, of fire patches on the landscape that promote avian diversity
   and conserve ecological functions. A management approach is needed that
   includes significant coverage of adjacent newly burned and older,
   unburned savanna habitat; the latter, in particular, is inadequately
   represented under current burning practices.}},

   food preferences and responses to experimental fire regimes}},
Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Dung beetles are an ecologically important group of insects globally,
   but the ecology of the Australian fauna is poorly known. Here, we report
   on the first ecological study of dung beetles in an Australian tropical
   savanna, documenting species composition, food preferences and responses
   to fire. Dung beetles were baited using dung from five types of
   vertebrates as well as mushrooms. We sampled at nine plots subject to
   experimental fire regimes (three replicates each of high fire severity,
   moderate fire severity and unburnt over 15 years) at the Territory
   Wildlife Park near Darwin. Our samples were comprised entirely of nine
   native species of Onthophagus. Dog dung was the most attractive bait,
   recording all nine species and nearly 80\% of all individuals, whereas
   no beetles were recorded at either wallaby or magpie-goose dung. Dung
   beetle abundance was highest under high fire severity and was negatively
   correlated with the cover of woody vegetation, a result driven by the
   two most common species, O. minsiculus and O. nr. quadripunctulatus. Our
   results indicate that Onthophagus is the dominant genus in dung-beetle
   assemblages of monsoonal Australia, as it is in open habitats of the
   Australian wet tropics. All our species of Onthophagus are relatively
   small (<= 10 mm body length) and are `tunnellers', storing dung and
   other food resources in tunnels dug immediately below the food source.
   Such an overwhelming dominance by small tunnellers does not occur in
   African savannas, reflecting the far lower availability of large
   mammalian dung in Australia.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Grassland birds have experienced greater population declines than any
   other guild of birds in North America, and yet we know little about
   habitat use and the affects of management during their non-breeding
   period on wintering grounds. The paucity of information on wintering
   grassland birds limits our ability to develop effective conservation
   strategies. We investigated habitat use by the winter bird community in
   grasslands with restored heterogeneity resulting from the interactive
   effects of fire and grazing. We used 500 m line transects distributed
   across patches (i.e., <13, 13-24, and >24 months post disturbance)
   resulting from spring burning with growing season grazing (April-Sept)
   and quantified avian relative abundance, community structure, and
   probability of patch occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection.
   Grassland structure that resulted from the fire-grazing interaction
   created heterogeneity among patches that influenced avian habitat use
   during winter. Generalist birds such as the Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were
   relatively common in all patch types while more specialized species such
   as the Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) and Le Conte's Sparrow
   (Ammodramus leconteii) reached greatest abundance and probability of
   occupancy in the patches with the least and greatest time post
   disturbance, respectively. This research provides novel information on
   the response of wintering birds to restored ecological processes in
   grasslands and can improve efforts to create effective conservation
   strategies. Our findings add to a growing body of literature supporting
   the use of fire and grazing to create a shifting grassland mosaic that
   increases vegetation structural and compositional heterogeneity and
   maximizes native biodiversity within rangeland ecosystems through the

Abstract = {{Questions A recently introduced non-native annual grass,Ventenata dubia,

   mosaic communities in the Inland Northwest. However, little is known of
   the drivers and potential ecological impacts of this rapidly expanding

Abstract = {{Closed-canopy, upland hardwood forests with limited understory
   development provide suboptimal habitat for wild turkey (Meleagris
   gallopavo) broods and may lead to low recruitment. Various forest
   management practices have been used to stimulate understory development
   within upland hardwoods, but evaluation of such practices on cover and
   food resources for wild turkey broods is incomplete. Therefore, we
   compared effects of 7 silvicultural treatments (repeated fire,
   shelterwood harvest, shelterwood harvest with one fire, retention cut,
   retention cut with repeated fire, retention cut with herbicide, and
   retention cut with herbicide and repeated fire) on cover and food
   resources for wild turkey broods in mature upland hardwoods of the Ridge
   and Valley Physiographic Province, Tennessee, USA, during 2000-2009.
   Canopy reduction treatments enhanced understory conditions for wild
   turkey broods. Eight years following initial treatment, light
   infiltration in retention cuts with repeated fire was 6 times greater
   than that within control, 5 times greater than that within shelterwood
   harvests, and twice that within shelterwood harvests with one prescribed
   fire. Woody species dominated understory composition following all
   treatments and controls. Understory disturbance (prescribed fire and
   broadcast herbicide treatments) reduced density of stems >1.4 m tall and
   <11.4 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) and created less visual
   obstruction above 1 m compared with canopy reduction treatments without
   understory disturbance. Following canopy reduction without repeated
   prescribed fire, woody vegetation exceeded ideal height for wild turkey
   broods after 3 growing seasons and light infiltration returned to
   control levels within 7 years. Soft mast production was greatest
   following treatments that included canopy reduction, but varied by year
   and site. Invertebrate biomass did not increase following any treatment,
   but all treatment areas contained enough invertebrates to meet the
   protein requirement for a wild turkey brood (10.1 poults) for 28 days on
   <30 ha. Where wild turkey is a focal species and understory structure
   inmature upland hardwoods is limiting for broods, we recommend reducing
   canopy coverage to 60-70\% and using low-intensity fire every 3-5 years
   to enhance and maintain brood cover and increase food availability. (C)

Abstract = {{Prior to Euro-American settlement, dry ponderosa pine and mixed conifer
   forests (hereafter, the ``dry forests{''}) of the Inland Northwest were
   burned by frequent low- or mixed-severity fires. These mostly surface
   fires maintained low and variable tree densities, light and patchy
   ground fuels, simplified forest structure, and favored fire-tolerant
   trees, such as ponderosa pine, and a low and patchy cover of associated
   fire-tolerant shrubs and herbs.
   Low- and mixed-severity fires provided other important feedbacks and
   effects to ponderosa pine-dominated stands and landscapes. For example,
   in stands, frequent surface fires favored an ongoing yet piecemeal
   regeneration of fire-tolerant trees by periodically exposing patches of
   mineral soil. They maintained fire-tolerant forest structures by
   elevating tree crown bases and scorching or consuming many seedlings,
   saplings, and pole-sized trees. They cycled nutrients from branches and
   foliage to the soil, where they could be used by other plants, and
   promoted the growth and development of low and patchy understory shrub
   and herb vegetation. Finally, surface fires reduced the long-term threat
   of running crown fires by reducing the fuel bed and metering out
   individual tree and group torching, and they reduced competition for
   site resources among surviving trees, shrubs, and herbs. In landscapes,
   the patterns of dry forest structure and composition that resulted from
   frequent fires reinforced the occurrence of low- or mixed-severity
   fires, because frequent burning spatially isolated conditions that
   supported high-severity fires. These spatial patterns reduced the
   likelihood of severe fire behavior and effects at each episode of fire.
   Rarely, dry forest landscapes were affected by more severe
   climate-driven events.
   Extant dry forests no longer appear or function as they once did. Large
   landscapes are homogeneous in their composition and structure, and the
   regional landscape is set up for severe, large fire and insect
   disturbance events. Among ecologists, there is also a high degree of
   concern about how future dry forests will develop, if fires continue to
   be large and severe. In this paper, we describe the key landscape
   pattern and process changes wrought by the sum of the settlement and
   management influences to date, and we point to an uncertain future for
   ecosystem management. Widespread selection cutting of the largest and
   oldest ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir in the 20th century has reduced
   much of the economic opportunity that might have been associated with
   restoration, and long-term investment will likely be needed, if
   large-scale restoration activities are attempted. An uncertain future
   for ecosystem management is based on the lack of current and improbable
   future social consensus concerning desired outcomes for public
   forestlands, the need for significant financial investment in ecosystem
   restoration, a lack of integrated planning and decision tools, and
   mismatches between the existing planning process, Congressional
   appropriations, and complex management and restoration problems. (c)

Abstract = {{Evidence of increasing fire extent and severity in the western US in
   recent decades has raised concern over the effects of fire on threatened
   species such as the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis Xantus de Vesey),
   which nests in forests with large trees and high canopy cover that are
   vulnerable to high-severity wildfire. A dichotomy of views exists on the
   impact of high-severity wildfire on the spotted owl. One view holds that
   reduction in the extent of forests with large trees and high canopy
   cover due to high-severity wildfire is a primary threat to spotted owls,
   and that fuels reduction treatments that successfully reduce the risk of
   high-severity wildfire can aid in sustaining desired conditions for this
   owl. A conflicting view maintains that high-severity wildfire was
   relatively common in many forest types occupied by spotted owls and does
   not pose an immediate threat to spotted owls, and that fuels reduction
   treatments are misguided because they degrade owl habitat and do not
   reduce the extent of high-severity fire. Based on the existing
   literature, we argue that considerable uncertainty remains regarding the
   response of spotted owls to high-severity wildfire, especially over
   longer time frames and across the three subspecies (California {[}Strix
   occidentalis occidentalis Xantus de Vesey], Mexican {[}S.o. lucida
   Nelson], and northern {[}S.o. caurina Merriam]) of spotted owls. The
   considerable extent of high-severity wildfire within the ranges of these
   subspecies over recent years, coupled with the trend toward increasing
   extent and severity of megafires, suggests that the cumulative effects
   of these fires could be significant throughout the range of this owl.
   Forest restoration or fuels reduction treatments may aid in reducing
   habitat loss, particularly when strategically located to optimize
   reduction of fire risk, but also may locally impact spotted owl habitat.
   We advocate further evaluation of both the impacts of such treatments to

   behavior. We also advocate wider use of managed fire to reduce risk of
   high-severity wildfire. Finally, given the paucity of long-term data on
   this topic, we recommend targeted research aimed at a decade or longer
   time periods after fires. These studies should include measures of
   demographic performance, and should be designed to elucidate differences
   in those metrics related to landscape pattern, forest type, and
   subspecies ecology. Such information would inform the debate over how to
   integrate the conservation of spotted owls and their habitat with fuels

Abstract = {{Wildfires have become more frequent and intense in recent years in the
   western United States. Previous studies have investigated the potential
   environmental and economic impacts of active management in burned forest
   landscapes. No previously published study, however, has considered
   wildlife requirements for snags while planning salvage logging
   operations in postburned landscapes. We examined the potential impacts
   of 19 snag retention strategies using cable-based yarding systems over a
   3-year time period since burn. The strategies were based on current
   research recommendations, operational needs, and state and federal
   policies. Potential impacts on two cavity-nesting bird habitats and the
   feasibility of each strategy were examined. We found that most snag
   retention strategies generated net revenues per unit volume of
   merchantable wood greater than \$70/m(3) immediately after a burn and
   \$60/m(3) 3 years after a burn. Those strategies that focused snag
   retention on smaller-diameter stems had the highest net revenue values
   and higher productivity rates. We also found that the strategy that
   removed all merchantable snags did not produce the highest revenue. In
   general, decreased yarding distance and a smaller yarding system (e.g.,
   shovel loader) resulted in greater net revenue per unit volume with
   increased time since burn. The salvage strategy that provided the most
   favorable habitat for the two cavity-nesting birds left all snags
   standing in the half of the salvage unit farthest away from the yarder.
   Our findings indicate that it is possible to provide adequate
   cavity-nesting bird habitat and generate net revenue during fire salvage
   operations.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is likely to result in an increased frequency of extreme
   fire events, including more large-extent wildfires. The effects of fire
   extent on post-fire faunal recovery are poorly understood. Effects on
   invertebrate detritivores are of particular interest due to their
   functional importance in litter breakdown. We asked if distance from
   fire edge affected the composition and morphological traits of a key
   group of large invertebrate detritivores: cockroaches (Blattodea) 6years
   after fire. We used six replicate transects in herb-rich foothill
   habitat in areas that were severely burnt during the 2009 Black Saturday
   fires, north-east of Melbourne, Australia. Transects extended from
   unburnt controls up to 5km into large extent burns. Habitat variables
   were measured and cockroach abundances were recorded using artificial
   habitats comprised of stacked egg trays. Cockroach morphological traits
   were recorded in the laboratory. Multivariate generalized linear models
   revealed that habitats varied with transect, but not distance into the
   burn, suggesting recovery of habitat features relevant to cockroaches.
   Distance from burn did not affect the species richness or abundance of
   cockroaches, but both richness and abundance increased with bark and
   litter cover and decreased at lower temperatures. Cockroach assemblage
   composition responded significantly to distance into burn, transect and
   habitat variables, although only Platyzosteria similis was negatively
   associated with distance into the burn. Fourth corner models including
   traits did not provide greater predictive power than models including
   only species abundances and environmental variables. Wing presence,
   which was associated with smaller body size, did not affect site
   occupancy. Although species traits did not predict cockroach responses,
   our work shows that distance into a fire, a surrogate for fire extent,
   continued to be an important determinant of post-fire assemblages 6years
   after fire. An increase in large-extent fires may reduce the
   recolonization potential of some cockroach species, potentially limiting
   their functional importance in litter breakdown.}},

Journal = {{IBIS}},
Abstract = {{Although the effects of shifting fire regimes on bird populations have
   been recognized as important to ecology and conservation, the
   consequences of fire for trophic interactions of avian species - and
   raptors in particular - remain relatively unknown. Here, we found that
   within national parks with long-standing (40+ years) fire management

   proportionally more Flying Squirrels Glaucomys oregonensis. We
   hypothesize this finding could have been driven by either changes to
   prey abundance following fires (e.g. increases in flying squirrels) or
   changes to prey availability (e.g. shifts in forest structure or flying
   squirrel spatial distribution that increased predation upon them by

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1615-1625}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Chaparral, a type of shrubland common throughout the California
   Floristic Province, is subject to management and removal in regions
   where wildfire threatens human lives and property. Management practices
   include conducting prescribed burns outside of the historical fire
   season and employing mechanical fuel reduction (mastication). As the
   wildland-urban interface grows, particularly in coastal California, more
   of this ecosystem is subject to active management.
   2. To understand the ecological implications of current California
   chaparral fire management practices, we studied bird species
   composition, abundance and foraging guilds in managed and unmanaged
   chaparral over 5 years. Study areas were located in Mendocino County in
   the coast ranges of northern California. We contrast six chaparral
   removal or ``fuels manipulation{''} treatments: (1) fall fire, (2)
   winter fire, (3) spring fire, (4) fall mastication, (5) spring
   mastication and (6) untreated control. Treatments and controls were
   implemented in plots 2 ha or larger, and replicated four times each.
   3. We find that species richness in prescribed fire treatments reaches
   comparable levels to controls in the first 3 years following treatment,
   whereas masticated units always have lower species richness. Generalized
   linear mixed models additionally confirm that mastication has highly
   negative effects on observed abundances of birds compared to controls
   and to prescribed fire.
   4. The season in which fuels reduction occurred was less important to
   species richness, although fall fire was more beneficial to bird
   abundance than spring or winter fire. Fire treatments in all seasons
   maintain the same general bird community structure as controls, while
   mastication results in strongly differentiated assemblages, increasing
   granivores while nearly excluding foliage gleaners.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We compare two California chaparral
   management techniques, prescribed fire and mastication, in three seasons
   (fall, winter and spring) in northern California, USA. We tracked
   chaparral bird community response in 23 experimental units for 2-5
   years. We conclude that prescribed fire and mastication are not
   interchangeable management techniques, and that mastication negatively
   impacts bird communities, altering guild structure and reducing both
   diversity and abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is a cost-effective habitat management tool in pine
   stands to enhance the quantity and quality of forage available for
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Management recommendations
   typically suggest a 3- to 5-year burn rotation in mixed pine-hardwood
   stands to increase quality forage production, but as fire frequency
   increases, forb and legume biomass increases, and woody browse
   decreases. A more frequent burn rotation may be a viable management
   option for deer managers, but there is still a lack of information
   regarding preferred forage and nutritional carrying capacity response to
   prescribed fire at these intervals. We measured the production and
   nutritional quality of forage within mature pine-hardwood stands after a
   1- or 2-year fire-return interval during three nutritionally stressful
   periods for deer on a 640-acre (259-hectare) enclosure located in
   east-central Alabama during 2014 and 2015. These stands had previously
   been burned annually for over 15 years, resulting in an abundance of
   herbaceous vegetation. We then compared forage class biomass,
   nutritional carrying capacity estimates, and digestible protein between
   burn treatments. A 1-year fire return interval improved habitat quality
   to a greater degree than a 2-year fire return interval by increasing the
   production of forage able to support greater nutritional planes. An
   annual burn rotation is an effective option for managers to increase
   protein availability in pine-hardwood stands, but other factors such as
   decreased cover availability and soft mast production should also be
   considered.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1205-1212}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly, forest management goals include building or maintaining
   resistance and/or resilience to disturbances in the face of climate
   change. Although a multitude of descriptive definitions for resistance
   and resilience exist, to evaluate whether specific management activities
   (silviculture) are effective, prescriptive characterizations are
   necessary. We introduce a conceptual framework that explicitly
   differentiates resistance and resilience, denotes appropriate scales,
   and establishes the context for evaluation structure and composition.
   Generally, resistance is characterized as the influence of structure and
   composition on disturbance, whereas resilience is characterized as the
   influence of disturbance on subsequent structure and composition.
   Silvicultural utility of the framework is demonstrated by describing
   disturbance-specific, time-bound structural and compositional objectives
   for building resistance and resilience to two fundamentally different
   disturbances: wildfires and spruce beetle outbreaks. The conceptual
   framework revealed the crucial insight that attempts to build stand or
   landscape resistance to spruce beetle outbreaks will ultimately be
   unsuccessful. This frees the silviculturist to focus on realistic goals
   associated with building resilience to likely inevitable outbreaks.
   Ultimately, because structure and composition, at appropriate scales,
   are presented as the standards for evaluation and manipulation, the
   framework is broadly applicable to many kinds of disturbance in various

Abstract = {{This paper provides an example of the practical application of
   multi-attribute trade-off analysis (MATA) to wildfire management. The
   MATA approach supports more informed decision-making because it exposes
   important trade-offs among competing management objectives (requiring
   value-based choices), helps guide and structure necessary technical
   judgements, explicitly represents uncertainty (i.e., not just expected
   outcomes but risk profiles around outcomes) and addresses temporal
   trade-offs. MATA promotes critical thinking about what analysis is
   required for decision-making. A MATA approach can be applied for all
   types of forest and fire management decisions. In this paper, we provide
   a sample application of MATA to an evaluation of landscape-level fuel
   treatments for managing wildfire risk. The study area is located in
   southeastern British Columbia, Canada where historical fire suppression
   policies and expanding development in wildland urban interface areas
   have resulted in an increase in both the probability and the
   consequences of stand replacement fires. We specify management
   objectives and develop measurable attributes for fire management costs,
   timber supply, property damage, landscape-level biodiversity, local air
   quality and climate change. We then simulate the effects on these
   attributes of four alternative fuel management strategies that include
   combinations of mechanical treatments and prescribed burning over a
   100-year period. The evaluation illustrates the key features of MATA

Abstract = {{Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Cambel oak Quercus
   gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than
   are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however,
   about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps,
   and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak
   (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding
   birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in
   size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern
   Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and
   occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth
   forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers
   (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus
   melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons)
   occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized
   Gambel oak 715 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence
   that large Gambel oak trees (>= 23 cm dbh) were associated with
   increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at
   points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by
   characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness
   was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when
   density of large pine trees >= 23 cm in diameter at breast height was
   low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to
   be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of
   additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that
   maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote
   growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird
   species in pine-oak forests.}},

Abstract = {{The fire-maintained longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern Coastal
   Plain harbors nearly 200 rare and endangered plant species, many of
   which depend on frequent fire for persistence. One such fire-dependent
   species is the federally endangered hemiparasite, Schwalbea americana L.

   flowering and subsequent seed production in this species, but the
   specific mechanisms involved in this fire-induced flowering response are
   unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the factors
   controlling the flowering response to fire. Using experimental
   treatments in the field and greenhouse, we examined the effect of
   variables associated with fire that may influence flowering of S.
   americana. Our field treatments included fire, shading immediately
   following fire, stem clipping plus competing vegetation exclusion, and
   mowing plus raking. Greenhouse treatments consisted of a gradient of
   light levels plus stem clipping. Our findings indicate that flowering,
   and subsequent viable seed production, is stimulated by a combination of
   clipping and increased light. These results suggest alternative
   management options for S. americana during years in which prescribed
   fire is not feasible. If prescribed fire is not an option, we suggest
   that mowing plus raking could be used as a temporary means to stimulate
   flowering and promote seed production and future seedling establishment.}},

Abstract = {{To more effectively manage remaining native grasslands and declining
   populations of prairie passerine birds, linkages between disturbance
   regimes, vegetation, and bird abundance need to be more fully
   understood. Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on
   mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in
   northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a
   habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on
   upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994
   breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition
   at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point,
   with over 80\% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15
   years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure
   from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately
   after fire, to increasing and moderate:amounts of forbs, litter, and
   shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with
   little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80
   years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood
   NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and
   abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le
   Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii),
   and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to
   an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned
   units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and
   Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance
   on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity,
   managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas
   with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or
   more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat
   unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern

Abstract = {{Natural grasslands are threatened globally. In south-eastern Australia,
   remnants of critically endangered natural grasslands are increasingly
   being isolated in urban areas. Urbanisation has led to reduced fire
   frequency and woody plant encroachment in some patches. Grasslands are
   currently being managed under the assumption that desirable management
   actions to address these threats (prescribed burning and removing woody
   vegetation) (1) lead to improved conservation outcomes and (2) are
   restricted by negative public attitudes. In this study, we tested these
   two assumptions in the context of native grassland conservation reserves
   in Melbourne, Australia. Firstly, we investigated differences in species
   and functional trait composition between patches that had been recently
   burnt, patches that were unburnt and patches subject to woody vegetation
   encroachment. We found that the functional traits of species converged
   in areas subject to woody plant encroachment and areas frequently
   disturbed by fire. Burning promoted native species, and patches of woody
   plants supressed the dominant grass, providing a wider range of habitat
   conditions. Secondly, we surveyed 477 residents living adjacent to these
   grassland conservation reserves to measure values, beliefs and attitudes
   and the acceptance of prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation.
   We found conflict in people's attitudes to grasslands, with both
   strongly positive and strongly negative attitudes expressed. The
   majority of residents found prescribed burning an acceptable management
   practice (contrary to expectations) and removing trees and shrubs from
   grasslands to be unacceptable. Both cognitive factors (values and
   beliefs) and landscape features were important in influencing these
   opinions. This research provides some guidance for managing urban
   grassland reserves as a social-ecological system, showing that
   ecological management, community education and engagement and landscape
   design features can be integrated to influence social and ecological

   California prairie restoration experiment}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Grassland and prairie restoration projects in California often result in
   long-term establishment of only a few native plant species, even when
   they begin with a diverse seed palette. One explanation for the
   disappearance of certain native species over time is that they are
   excluded through competition. If so, management that reduces
   interspecific competition may favor ``subordinate'' natives and promote
   greater native species diversity in restored communities. Potential
   management approaches to accomplish this goal include intraspecific
   spatial aggregation during seeding and prescribed fire. However, no
   studies have experimentally evaluated the effects of fire on a
   controlled (restoration) species pool or the interaction between fire
   and spatial aggregation. In a previous California prairie restoration
   experiment, we demonstrated that aggregated plantings protected
   competitively subordinate species from exclusion and increased community
   diversity for three years. However, native species richness declined
   throughout the study, and the benefits of aggregated seeding had begun
   to disappear by the third year. For the present study, we resurveyed the
   experimental plots five years after seeding and in the following year
   carried out controlled burns on half of the plots. The four subordinate
   species and one of the previously dominant species continued to decline
   and essentially disappeared aboveground during years four and five.
   However, burning in year five decreased the cover of dominant natives,
   triggered the reappearance of the three subordinate species that had
   disappeared or nearly disappeared in previous years, and increased
   diversity of the restored community. Seeding treatments (aggregated or

Abstract = {{Fields dominated by tail fescue (Festuca arundinacea) are common

   plots to the following treatments: control, fall burning, fall disking,
   spring burning, spring disking, spring herbicide application, summer
   burning, or summer disking. We measured the vegetation structure, seed
   production, and floristic composition within each treatment plot from
   fall 1990 to summer 1994. The spring herbicide application most
   effectively reduced tall fescue coverage. Fescue coverage was reduced
   for one year following disturbance by fall, spring, and summer disking,
   but had become similar to control plots and pre-treatment conditions by
   the second year post-treatment. Fall, spring, and summer burning did not
   reduce tall fescue coverage. Fall-disked plots improved habitat for
   bobwhite winter feeding during winter 1993, whereas herbicide-treated
   plots provided the best winter feeding habitat during winter 1994,
   Herbicide-treated plots provided the best habitat quality for bobwhite

Abstract = {{Conducting dormant season or springtime prescribed fire treatments has
   become a common practice in many regions of the United States to restore
   ecosystems to their natural state. Despite the knowledge that
   historically, fires often occurred during the summer, the application of
   summer burns has been deterred, in part, by a lack of understanding of
   fire season effects on vegetation. We explored the differences in fire
   effects between spring and summer burns at Voyageurs National Park,
   Minnesota. The fire season effects on the ground layer vegetation were
   clearly different among the treatments: pre-burn, spring, and summer.
   Vegetation composition of pre-burn and after spring fires was similar,
   but differed significantly from the summer fires. Spring fires
   propagated the same species that were present prior to the fire, whereas
   summer fires promoted a new suite of species through the germination of
   seedbank and high seed dispersal species. Cover and richness of seed
   bank and intolerant species were greatest after the summer fires, which
   contributed to the peak in richness found across all reproductive and
   tolerance attributes five years after these fires. Post summer fire
   composition showed shifts in composition through time. Substantial
   differences in the effects of burn seasonality on ground layer
   vegetation should be considered in long term restoration efforts to help

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{1. Current predictions about climate change and its impact on fire
   regimes have spurred research on how increasing fire frequencies will
   affect the population dynamics of fire-dependent species. There has been
   less consideration of changes in the spatial characteristics of fire
   regimes, despite recognition of the importance of spatial heterogeneity
   and connectivity in population dynamics. 2. Here, we test the hypothesis
   that spatial heterogeneity in fire regimes may not benefit obligate
   seeders with canopy seed bank, due to regeneration constraints into
   non-burned areas. We develop a size-structured population model for a
   population of Tecate cypress Callitropsis forbesii (Jeps.) Little, a
   rare obligate seeder of conservation concern, across a complex landscape
   in the Santa Ana Mountains (Orange, CA, USA). Combining the population
   model with field measurements of stand structure and fire history, we
   test the roles of heterogeneity in fire regime and dispersal among
   patches with differing fire history on population persistence. 3. The
   model predicts population persistence at fire return intervals >17years,
   the approximate fire return interval at the site over the last century.
   However, population growth and population persistence increase when
   subpopulations are connected by dispersal and, within a small window of
   fire return intervals, when subpopulations have uncorrelated fire
   dynamics. Contrary to our expectations, spatial heterogeneity in fire
   regime increased population growth rates at intermediate (15-25year)
   fire return intervals. 4. Synthesis and applications. Conservation
   efforts focused on isolated populations of fire-dependent species should
   focus on both the temporal (fire return interval) and spatial
   (heterogeneity in fire occurrence) aspects of fire regimes. For one
   threatened Cypress species, we find that the interaction between
   temporal and spatial characteristics of a fire regime can increase the
   risks of population extinction, particularly under fire regimes
   characterized by more frequent, larger and more spatially homogenous
   fire. Species with fragmented subpopulations not well connected by
   dispersal also have a greater risk of extinction under these fire
   regimes.}},

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{157-176}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a complex physical and ecological process and one that has
   dramatically affected New Zealand's landscapes and ecosystems in the
   post-settlement era. Prior to human settlement in the late 13th century,
   the Holocene palaeoenvironmental record suggests that fire frequencies
   were low across most of New Zealand, with the notable exception of some
   wetland systems. Because few of New Zealand's indigenous plant species
   show any real adaptation to fire, the greatly increased fire activity
   that accompanied human settlement resulted in widespread, and in some
   cases permanent, shifts in the composition, structure and function of
   many terrestrial ecosystems. The combined effects of Maori and European
   fire have left long-lasting legacies in New Zealand's landscapes with
   the most obvious being the reduction of forest cover from 85-90\% to
   25\% of the land area. Here we review the long-term ecological history
   of fire in New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems and describe what is
   known about the fire ecology of New Zealand's plant species and
   communities, highlighting key uncertainties and areas where future
   research is required. While considerable emphasis has been placed on
   describing and understanding the `initial burning period' that
   accompanied Maori arrival, much less ecological emphasis has been placed
   on the shifts in fire regime that occurred during the European period,
   despite the significant effects these had. Post-fire successional
   trajectories have been described for a number of wetland and forest
   communities in New Zealand, but in contemporary landscapes are
   complicated by the effects of exotic mammalian species that act as seed
   and seedling predators and herbivores, reduced pollination and dispersal
   services due to declines in the avifauna, and the presence of
   pyrophyllic exotic plant species. Many invasive plant species (e.g.
   Pinus spp., Acacia spp., Hakea spp., Ulex europaeus) are favoured by
   fire and now co-occur with indigenous plant species in communities whose
   long-term composition and trajectory are unclear. On the other hand,
   some highly-valued ecosystems such as tussock grasslands may require
   recurrent fire for their long-term persistence. Combined, the direct and
   indirect effects of the introduction of anthropic fire to New Zealand
   may have shifted large areas into successional `traps' from which, in
   the face of recurrent fire, escape is difficult. Developing appropriate
   management strategies in such a context requires a nuanced understanding
   of the place of fire in New Zealand's ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{375}},
Pages = {{84-95}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{The prevailing paradigm in the western U.S. is that the increase in
   stand-replacing wildfires in historically frequent-fire dry forests is
   due to unnatural fuel loads that have resulted from management
   activities including fire suppression, logging, and grazing, combined
   with more severe drought conditions and increasing temperatures. To
   counteract unnaturally high fuel loads, fuel reduction treatments which
   are designed to reduce fire hazard and improve overall ecosystem
   functioning have been increasing over the last decade. However, until
   recently much of what we knew about treatment effectiveness was based on
   modeling and predictive studies. Now, there are many examples of
   wildfires burning through both treated and untreated areas, and the
   effectiveness of treatments versus no action can be evaluated
   empirically. We carried out a systematic review to address the question:
   Are fuel treatments effective at achieving ecological and social (saving
   human lives and property) objectives? We found 56 studies addressing
   fuel treatment effectiveness in 8 states in the western US. There was
   general agreement that thin + burn treatments had positive effects in
   terms of reducing fire severity, tree mortality, and crown scorch. In
   contrast, burning or thinning alone had either less of an effect or none
   at all, compared to untreated sites. Most studies focused on carbon
   storage agreed that treatments do not necessarily store more carbon
   after wildfire, but result in less post-wildfire emissions and less
   carbon loss in a wildfire due to tree mortality. Understory responses
   are mixed across all treatments, and the response of other ecological
   attributes (e.g., soil, wildlife, water, insects) to treatment
   post-wildfire represents an important data gap; we provide a detailed
   agenda for future research. Overall, evidence is strong that thin + burn
   treatments meet the goal of reducing fire severity, and more research is
   needed to augment the few studies that indicate treatments protect human
   lives and property. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown the importance of accounting for burn severity
   when assessing the effects of forest fires on avian communities. We add
   to this growing literature with one of the first studies to assess these
   effects in boreal and hemiboreal regions of North America. We conducted
   point counts in control and treatment areas for 2-3 years before
   (2009-2011) and 4-5 years after (2012-2016) the Pagami Creek Fire in
   northern Minnesota, USA. Our primary objectives were to (1) assess the
   effects of burn status, burn severity and burn heterogeneity on avian
   communities and patterns of abundance in individual bird species and (2)
   compare these results when counts were either restricted to 100 m count
   radii or corrected for potential detection heterogeneity. Species
   richness and total abundance of birds were best described by a burn
   severity by year interaction, with lower-severity burns having similar
   patterns to control areas and higher-severity burns showing reduced
   abundance and richness following the fire. Nevertheless, values
   associated with higher-severity burns returned to near-control levels
   after five years. Of 43 species analyzed, 27 showed detectable responses
   to the fire through shifts in abundance. Nearly equal proportions of
   these species had generally positive versus negative effects of the
   fire. Sixteen (59\%) of these fire responses were mediated by burn
   severity, while four (15\%) and seven (26\%) were best predicted by burn
   heterogeneity or burn status, respectively. Of the species whose
   response to the fire was mediated by burn severity, the majority (81\%)
   had decreased abundance as burn severity increased. However, all species
   responding to burn heterogeneity or burn status showed positive
   relationships to these metrics. Results were similar between analytical
   methods that adjusted for species detectability vs those that did not,
   with 78\% of species having the same interpretation of fire effects.
   Burn severity and heterogeneity, in addition to the sole distinction of
   whether an area was burned, dictate the response of birds to forest fire
   in hemiboreal forests. Mixed-severity fires, which include a range of
   burn severities and associated vegetation change, will likely benefit
   the most bird species in this region. When possible, management should
   focus on retaining this spectrum of post-fire conditions, though of
   primary importance is the inclusion of wildfire in forest planning and
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a common disturbance in many ecosystems, including arid
   Australia. Understanding whether fauna respond in a deterministic manner
   towards a single end-point, or to multiple states, is of crucial
   importance for conservation management. Why different taxa or
   assemblages display single or multiple end-points is also important to
   develop a synthetic theory of succession. To examine the post-fire
   changes in assemblages of spiders, we established a chronosequence study
   in spinifex habitat of central Western Australia. Ground-active spiders
   were pitfall-trapped over nine months in sites representing experimental
   fires (0 and 0.5 years post-fire) and wildfires (3, 5, 8 and 20 years
   post-fire). There were significant non-linear changes in species
   richness, evenness and composition of spiders with increasing post-fire
   age. For all three measures, the assemblage appeared highly
   deterministic, converging towards the long unburnt state. Similarity in
   richness, evenness and species composition to the 20-year-old sites all
   increased with increasing time since fire (38 years). However,
   experimentally burnt sites did not neatly fit this sequence. We consider
   two alternative hypotheses to explain this second trajectory: inertia
   within the system or the rapid migration and recolonization from nearby
   surrounding unburnt areas. Analyses indicated that half of the 179
   species had significant preferences for, or were restricted to,
   particular post-fire ages. This suggests that adequate pyrodiversity,
   both in terms of post-fire ages and/or scale and intensity of fires, may
   be important for the conservation of spiders in this habitat. However,
   owing to the high number of singletons and low indicator values, the
   significance of this result for conservation management remains
   equivocal. Despite this, the high degree of determinism provides hope
   that managers can develop a good predictive understanding of post-fire
   successional changes in spider assemblages in arid Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits are thought to be important determinants of the
   resilience of animal species to a rapidly changing global climate.
   Although increasing temperature has taken centre stage in the debate
   over climate change, animals will have to survive more than just extreme
   heat to persist in the Anthropocene. The aim of this review is to
   stimulate interest in the opportunities for integrative and applied
   behavioural study of how animals can survive life-threatening weather
   events, in order to help achieve the societal goal of maintaining viable
   wildlife populations under future climate scenarios. First, using the
   thermoregulatory behaviour of a hypothetical ground squirrel species as
   an example, we explore how different scenarios of behavioural
   flexibility, plasticity, adaptation, exaptation and management action
   can lead to population persistence or extinction. Next, we propose that
   considering weather events such as heatwaves, storms and floods,
   wildfire and drought as selective pressures worthy of investigation
   provides a new research framework for climate-related conservation
   behaviour. In our review we provide examples of the responses of animals
   to different types of weather extremes and describe behavioural
   adaptations to environments with extreme climates. We give
   methodological recommendations to jump start climate change research by
   behaviourists. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for using citizen
   science and a public video repository to foster evidence-based decision
   making for managing habitats and prioritizing species conservation
   efforts in light of the threats to biodiversity posed by climate change.

Abstract = {{Landscape-scale short-rotation early-growing season prescribed fire,
   hereafter prescribed fire, in upland hardwood forests represents a
   recent shift in management strategies across eastern upland forests. Not
   only does this strategy depart from dormant season to growing season
   prescriptions, but the strategy also moves from stand-scale to
   landscape-scale implementation (>1,000 ha). This being so, agencies are
   making considerable commitments in terms of time and resources to this
   management strategy, but the effects on wildlife in upland forests,
   especially those dominated by hardwood canopy species, are relatively
   unknown. We initiated our study to assess whether this management
   strategy affects eastern wild turkey reproductive ecology on the
   Ozark-St. Francis National Forest. We marked 67 wild turkey hens with
   Global Positioning System (GPS) Platform Transmitting Terminals in 2012
   and 2013 to document exposure to prescribed fire, and estimate daily
   nest survival, nest success, and nest-site selection. We estimated these
   reproductive parameters in forest units managed with prescribed fire
   (treated) and units absent of prescribed fire (untreated). Of 60 initial
   nest attempts monitored, none were destroyed or exposed to prescribed
   fire because a majority of fires occurred early than a majority of the
   nesting activity. We found nest success was greater in untreated units
   than treated units (36.4\% versus 14.6\%). We did not find any habitat
   characteristic differences between successful and unsuccessful
   nest-sites. We found that nest-site selection criteria differed between
   treated and untreated units. Visual concealment and woody ground cover
   were common selection criteria in both treated and untreated units.
   However, in treated units wild turkey selected nest-sites with fewer
   small shrubs (<5 cm ground diameter) and large trees (>20 cm DBH) but
   not in untreated units. In untreated units wild turkey selected
   nest-sites with more large shrubs (>= 5cm ground diameter) but did not
   select for small shrubs or large trees. Our findings suggest that wild
   turkey have not benefited from the reintroduction of prescribed fire to

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Limber pine (Anus flexilis), an understudied tree species important to
   montane and subalpine ecosystems, is listed as endangered in Alberta.
   Dispersal of seeds to newly disturbed, open areas by Clark's nutcracker
   (Nucifraga columbiana) is expected to facilitate post-disturbance
   establishment of limber pine. Prescribed burning has thus been proposed
   as a tool to stimulate natural regeneration, but no studies have yet
   surveyed limber pine's regenerative response to disturbance at the
   northernmost extent of its range. We examined post-fire regeneration in
   one prescribed burn and one wildfire at the northern edge of limber
   pine's distribution and compared this to a regeneration baseline of
   plots in nearby unburned limber pine acting as seed sources to the bums.
   Using a likelihood-based approach, we then compared hypotheses of
   ecological processes influencing seedling occurrence and abundance.
   Overall, we found only six post-fire limber pine seedlings within the
   burns, as compared to one hundred twenty-four similarly aged seedlings
   found in unburned plots. Akaike information criterion (AIC) identified
   distance to a seed source and absence of canopy cover as hurdles for
   seedling establishment in the burn. Analysis of seedling abundance was
   performed on only the unburned dataset due to low regeneration in the
   burned areas surveyed; model selection here showed that when distance to
   a seed source is small, substrate variables, including less prevalent
   bare mineral soil, more rocky cover, and finer soil textures, take on an
   important role in driving abundance. Substrates important for limber
   pine abundance in unburned stands were found with similar frequency in
   the burns, indicating limber pine colonization post-disturbance was not
   substrate limited but instead constrained by other factors. Our findings
   suggest that extensive prescribed burns and stand-replacing wildfire
   events at the northern extent of limber pine's range may have limited
   seedling regeneration in the immediate post-fire period. Conservation
   efforts may be well-served by focusing on fire mitigation efforts, such
   as thinning and other fuel treatments, in areas surrounding established
   limber pine stands. Finally, post-disturbance stands could benefit from
   supplementary seedling plantings to achieve recovery plan restoration
   goals for this endangered species.}},

   extensive research on the effects of fuel reduction and restoration
   treatments on trees, fuels, regeneration, and fire behavior; but less is
   known about how these treatments influence understory vegetation, which
   contains the majority of vascular plant diversity in many dry conifer
   forests. Of particular interest is how understory vegetation may respond
   to the season and interval of prescribed burning. The season and
   interval of prescribed burning is often determined by operational
   constraints rather than historical fire regimes, potentially resulting
   in fire conditions and burn intervals to which native plants are poorly
   adapted. In this study, we examined how understory vegetation has
   responded to season and interval of prescribed burning in ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon,
   USA. Using over a decade (2002-2015) of understory vegetation data
   collected in stands with different intervals (5 versus 15 year) and
   seasons (spring versus fall) of prescribed burning, we quantified how
   season and interval of prescribed burning has influenced understory
   vegetation compositional trajectories and indicator species over time.
   Season of prescribed burning resulted in different understory
   communities and distinct trajectories of understory composition over
   time, but interval of burning did not. Indicator species analysis
   suggests fall burning is facilitating early seral species, with native
   annual forbs displaying ephemeral responses to frequent burning, while
   invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increased in abundance and
   frequency across all treatments over time. These findings indicate that
   understory vegetation in these ecosystems are sensitive to seasonality
   of burning, but the responses are subtle. Our findings suggest season
   and interval of prescribed burning used in this study do not result in
   large changes in understory vegetation community composition, a key
   consideration as land managers increase the pace and scale of prescribed
   fire in these forests.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological interactions between fire and grazing have shaped the
   evolutionary history of grassland ecosystems. Currently, grassland birds
   have experienced ongoing population declines, following widespread
   implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that reduce
   habitat heterogeneity. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative rangeland
   management strategy that promotes habitat heterogeneity and
   biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr. field study in the central Flint
   Hills of Kansas to compare the spatial ecology of female Greater
   Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) in rangelands managed with
   intensive rangeland management versus patch-burn grazing. This is the
   first study on the effects of patch-burn grazing on the space use
   decisions of Greater Prairie-Chickens at the home range scale. We used
   seasonal estimates of home range for 6-mo breeding and nonbreeding
   periods, as well as resource utilization functions to investigate the
   response of female prairie chickens to landscape metrics describing
   fire, grazing, and proximity to anthropogenic structures or lek sites.
   In our analysis of all radio-marked females, distance to lek was
   consistently the strongest predictor of space use during both breeding
   and nonbreeding seasons. Females captured at properties managed with
   patch-burn grazing selected areas with low stocking rates and high fire
   frequencies, and they avoided recently burned areas. Our study provides
   new evidence that patch-burn grazing can improve grassland habitat for
   Greater Prairie-Chickens, an umbrella species in the tallgrass prairie
   ecosystem. Patch-burn grazing created preferred habitats for female
   Greater Prairie-Chickens, with a relatively frequent fire return
   interval, a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, and a reduced
   stocking rate in unburned areas avoided by grazers. Widespread
   implementation of patch-burn grazing could result in significant
   improvements in habitat quality for wildlife in the tallgrass prairie

Abstract = {{Fire events have increased in scale and severity due to hotter, drier
   conditions brought on by climate change and fire suppression. Extreme
   fire events can be detrimental to forest specialists, especially
   populations at the edge of the species range, where conditions can vary

   Our top models indicated that flying squirrels occupy lower burn
   severities but could still occur at higher burn severities if canopy
   cover remained intact, forest duff remained deep, and tree mortality
   remained low, especially on steeper slopes. Our study illustrates the
   ability of San Bernardino flying squirrels, and the potential for other

Abstract = {{The black bear (Ursus americanus) is a species of interest for wildlife
   and forest managers, landowners, hunters, and the public. Because of
   their overall adaptability to changing habitat conditions, wide-ranging
   nature, and omnivorous habits, black bears are readily accommodated in a
   forest management program. A well-managed forest that provides adequate
   opportunities for movements, foraging, denning, and cover has better
   potential to satisfy the needs of bears than an unmanaged forest. Food
   supplies should be abundant, stable, and diverse. Habitats that harbor
   natural dens should be conserved, known den sites should be protected,
   and creation of potential den habitat and den sites should be considered
   in forest habitat treatments. In addition, natural escape cover should
   be maintained, and opportunities should be undertaken to create or
   enhance cover for bedding, escape, and dispersal. Although bear habitat
   management has traditionally been associated with timber management, the
   use of prescribed fire holds promise as an effective tool for
   enhancement of black bear habitat in the central hardwood landscape. In
   this paper, various aspects of black bear habitat ecology are reviewed,
   and the use of prescribed fire alone or in conjunction with other
   silvicultural techniques to maintain, enhance, and restore habitat
   conditions for black bears is explored. Evaluation of prescribed fire
   behavior and activity, habitat responses to fire under various
   conditions, and associated implications for bears could be useful in
   developing ``best fire management practices{''} in bear habitat.
   Prescribed fire should be used in an adaptive management approach. This
   entails not only the application of fire, but also the diligent
   monitoring of habitat and wildlife responses, and fine-tuning future
   actions. Topics of investigation concerning bears and fire are listed.
   Public education programs conveying the ecological effects and benefits
   of prescribed fire for habitat, wildlife, and humans, and the
   development of public/private partnerships for habitat management are
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Pine rocklands are deeply imperiled habitats restricted to South Florida
   and the Caribbean. In South Florida, more than 98\% of pine rockland
   habitat has been destroyed in the past century (outside of Everglades
   National Park). Due to their proximity to human populations, management
   options in the remaining fragments are sometimes limited, and fires that
   are necessary to maintain healthy habitat structure are often excluded.
   Despite these pressures, conservation initiatives in pine rocklands have
   been surprisingly successful, and plant extinction has been avoided. In
   the coming decades, however, sea-level rise threatens to all but
   eliminate the pine rocklands, and efforts to preserve their many endemic
   species will likely fail. We synthesize the results of numerous
   ecological studies and review the successes and failures of conservation
   in South Florida's pine rocklands. Further, we illustrate the value of
   continued conservation efforts, and provide direction in the light of
   the habitats long-term fate. We advocate the increased use of prescribed
   fire and, as the effects of climate change become more apparent, the
   translocation of some endemic species. Finally, we acclaim pine
   rocklands as a model system for studying how plant communities respond
   to environmental change. South Florida's fragmented landscape, with
   shifting gradients of elevation, salinity, inundation and nutrient
   availability, should continue to inspire ecologists to address important
   questions, and better prepare the region, and the world, for the
   challenges of the coming decades.}},

Title = {{Different burning intensities affect cavity utilization patterns by
   arboreal ants in a tropical savanna canopy}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{116}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a natural disturbance in many ecosystems worldwide, including
   tropical savannas, where it drives the assembly of animal and plant
   communities. The effect of fire is often indirect, impacting the
   availability of essential resources like food and shelter. The Brazilian
   Cerrado is the largest tropical savanna in the world, and ants comprise
   a very high proportion of its animal biomass. About one-third of the
   Cerrado ant fauna actively forages in the canopy. These ants use trees
   not just in search of food but also as their main shelter resource, as
   most arboreal ants nest mainly in cavities produced by wood-boring
   beetles. While it seems clear that fire can have important direct and
   indirect effects on arboreal ants, the number of studies using an
   experimental approach focusing on such impacts is relatively few. Here,
   we aimed to understand the impacts of fire on arboreal ants usage of
   shelter resources. Moreover, we also evaluated the potential influence
   of different fire intensities on these resources usage. For this, we
   assessed the colonization rates of experimental cavities under four
   different burning intensities: control, low-intensity,
   intermediate-intensity, and high-intensity. We hypothesized that fire
   would have a detrimental effect on cavity occupation. This effect would
   be stronger in higher intensity burns, once they can dramatically
   decrease the availability of natural cavities and, thus, the abundance
   and richness of arboreal ants. We also predicted that some ant species
   would be indicative of different fire intensities, due to differences in
   heat tolerance and colony size. Our data showed that fire had a major
   positive effect on experimental cavity use by arboreal ants, with more
   ant species, more colonized trees, and higher cavity occupation under
   fire treatments. This effect was higher with the increase of fire
   intensity. Some ant species were found more commonly on distinct fire
   treatments, which was mainly due to their different nesting site
   requirements and colony sizes. Jointly, these results show that fire
   affects arboreal ant cavity colonization patterns, and that fire
   intensity is extremely critical in shaping these patterns. Altogether,
   our work offers important insights for a better understanding of the
   effects of ecological disturbances on resource use patterns of a highly
   abundant and diverse organism.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important tool for fuel reduction, the control of
   competing vegetation, and forest restoration. The accumulated fuels
   associated with historical fire exclusion can cause undesirably high
   tree mortality rates following prescribed fires and wildfires. This is
   especially true for sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas), which is
   already negatively affected by the introduced pathogen white pine
   blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Rabenh). We tested the
   efficacy of raking away fuels around the base of sugar pine to reduce
   mortality following prescribed fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national
   parks, California, USA. This study was conducted in three prescribed
   fires and included 457 trees, half of which had the fuels around their
   bases raked away to mineral soil to 0.5 m away from the stem. Fire
   effects were assessed and tree mortality was recorded for three years
   after prescribed fires. Overall, raking had no detectable effect on
   mortality: raked trees averaged 30\% mortality compared to 36\% for
   unraked trees. There was a significant effect, however, between the
   interaction of raking and average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth:
   the predicted probability of survival of a 50 cm dbh tree was 0.94 vs.
   0.96 when average pre-treatment fuel depth was 0 cm for a raked and
   unraked tree, respectively. When average pre-treatment forest floor fuel
   depth was 30 cm, the predicted probability of survival for a raked 50 cm
   dbh tree was 0.60 compared to only 0.07 for an unraked tree. Raking did
   not affect mortality when fire intensity, measured as percent crown
   volume scorched, was very low (0\% scorch) or very high (>80\% scorch),
   but the raking treatment significantly increased the proportion of trees
   that survived by 9.6\% for trees that burned under moderate fire
   intensity (1\% to 80\% scorch). Raking significantly reduced the
   likelihood of bole charring and bark beetle activity three years post
   fire. Fuel depth and anticipated fire intensity need to be accounted for
   to maximize the effectiveness of the treatments. Raking is an important
   management option to reduce tree mortality from prescribed fire, but is
   most effective under specific fuel and burning conditions.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{447}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Historically, frequent, low-severity fires in dry western North American
   forests were a major driver of ecological patterns and processes,
   creating resilient ecosystems dominated by widely-spaced pine species.
   However, a century of fire-suppression has caused overcrowding, altering
   forest composition to shade-tolerant species, while increasing
   competition and leaving trees stressed and susceptible to pathogens,
   insects, and high-severity fire. Exacerbating the issue, fire incidence
   is expected to increase with changing climate, while fire season has
   been observed to begin earlier and last longer than historic trends.
   Forest thinning and prescribed fire have been identified as important
   management tools to mitigate these risks. Yet little is known of how
   thinning, fire, or their interaction affect contemporary evolutionary
   processes of constituent pine species that influence fitness and play an
   important role in the opportunity for selection and population
   persistence. We assessed the impact of widely used fuel reduction
   treatments on fine-scale gene flow on an ecologically important and
   historically dominant shade-intolerant pine species of the Sierra
   Nevada, Pinus lambertiana Dougl. Treatment prescription
   (no-thin-no-fire, thin-no-fire, and fire-and-thin) was found to
   differentially affect both fine-scale spatial and genetic structure as
   well as effective gene flow in this species. Specifically, the
   thin-no-fire prescription increases genetic structure (spatial
   autocorrelation of relatives) between adults and seedlings, while seed
   and pollen dispersal increase and decrease, respectively, as a function
   of increasing disturbance intensity. While these results may be specific
   to the stands at our study site, they indicate how assumptions relating
   to genetic effects based on spatial structure can be misleading (for
   instance, in many stands the presence or absence of spatial structure
   was not indicative the presence or absence of genetic structure). It is
   likely that these disequilibrated systems will continue to evolve on
   unknown evolutionary trajectories. The long-term impacts of management
   practices on reduced fitness from inbreeding depression should be
   continually monitored to ensure resilience to increasingly frequent and
   severe fire, drought, and pest stresses.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is widely recognized as having been a major force shaping the
   character of eastern hardwood forests. Exclusion of periodic surface
   fires from mixed hardwood stands for over 70 years has contributed to
   the gradual succession of shade-tolerant species into the understory and

   these shade-tolerant species or pioneer shade-intolerant species are
   able to out-compete oak regeneration and dominate the next stand.
   Because of fire exclusion for many decades, regeneration of
   oak-dominated stands has been a major silvicultural problem. Recent

   wildfire, we examined the structure and composition of vegetation along
   the gradient from burned stands into the adjacent forest interior at
   three salvage logged edges and three unsalvaged edges in
   Douglas-fir/hardwood forests of northwestern California. Natural,
   unsalvaged edges were characterized by an increase of native, ruderal
   species, rather than a reduction of forest interior species. Only two
   forest interior species reacted negatively to the edge environment, both
   at salvaged edges. Old-growth community types, identified by two-way
   indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), occurred 30 m closer to the edge
   at unsalvaged sites, compared to salvaged sites. Twenty commonly

   unsalvaged stands, the removal of snags and subsequent broadcast burning
   of salvaged logged stands significantly altered plant composition and

Abstract = {{Land managers seeking to reestablish historical fire regimes need
   guidance on how to apply prescribed fire to promote the population
   persistence of endangered species. We explored extinction risks of
   Hypericum cumulicola , a fire-dependent plant endemic to the Lake Wales
   Ridge, Florida (U.S.A). Stochastic and deterministic matrix population
   models based on six censuses (1994-1999) and data from several
   germination and seedling survival experiments were used to compare H.
   cumulicola demography and extinction probabilities under different fire
   regimes. Environmental variation associated with site, year, and winter
   precipitation was included in these models. We estimated time to
   extinction of unburned populations of different sizes and the
   probabilities of extinction under no fire, different regular fire-return
   intervals, and alternating short and long fire-return intervals.
   Following an initial fire, even relatively large populations of
   thousands of individuals may become locally extinct within 300-400 years
   without additional fires. Extinction probability declined as intervals
   between fires decreased. Fire intervals of >50 years resulted in an
   appreciable extinction probability after 200 years. Cycles of highly
   staggered short and long fire-return intervals caused slightly higher
   chances of extinction than regular fire-return intervals. The
   simulations were sensitive to estimates of survival in the seed bank.
   Active management will be required to restore favorable fire regimes in

   should consider variable fire regimes to match the requirements of a

Abstract = {{The buttongrass blanket moorlands are a unique habitat that constitutes
   a major landscape feature within the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage
   Area (TWWHA) of southwestern Tasmania. They are a highly pyrogenic
   vegetation type that has had a long history of regular burning by
   aborigines. Buttongrass may require a fire frequency of 5-20 years in
   order to maintain its suitability as habitat for many endemic
   vertebrates. The present knowledge of the Acari in the peat/litter
   accumulations in buttongrass is very poor and their response to fire is
   not understood. This study addresses the following questions: (1) How do
   soil mite communities in recently burned buttongrass compare with those
   that have not been burned in several decades? and (2) Are fire
   frequencies of between 5-20 years sufficient for soil mite populations
   to recover? A survey of soil mites was undertaken in a chronosequence of
   age classes of buttongrass at two study areas in the TWWHA. Six
   soil-cores were removed from up to four sites of each age class at
   3-months intervals for 1 year, a total of 870 soil cores. All mature
   mites were identified to morphospecies with many individuals identified
   to genus or species. The soil mite community within buttongrass was
   found to be rich both at family and species level, in Oribatida,
   Prostigmata, and Mesostigmata. This community was significantly affected
   by fire, with a reduced number of species for many years post-fire.
   Density and diversity of these populations are positively correlated
   with age and many communities only changed significantly after 30-40
   years post fire, which is in conflict with the prevailing management
   practice of burning every 5-20 years.}},

Abstract = {{Since European settlement Australian native rodents have experienced
   dramatic extinctions and declines. We investigated long-term population
   and distribution changes during 1981-2003, and known or potential causal
   factors of decline in the vulnerable New Holland mouse (Pseudomys
   novaehollandiae). We found that populations (n=8) were extant for 1-6
   years and were predominantly small, localised and extinction prone.
   High-density populations occurred after above-average rainfall but
   declined precipitously during drought. Wildfire resulted in the
   extirpation of some populations, while others survived in unburnt
   refugia. We propose that post-fire vegetation (3-7 years)
   contemporaneous with above-average rainfall delivered productive habitat
   resulting in both a population irruption, and recovery after wildfire.
   Population declines occurred in drought periods. Recent trapping at 42
   sites (2013-17) failed to record any New Holland mice. The species has
   not been recorded since 2003. Recovery is unlikely without intensive
   management, focussed on remnant or reintroduced populations, including
   protection from habitat fragmentation and inappropriate fire regimes.
   Prevention of extinction of the species throughout its southern range

   expansion into sagebrush steppe ecosystems has affected both native
   wildlife and economic livelihoods across western North America. The
   potential listing of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus)

   identify optimal juniper removal sites in Northeastern California across
   weighted goals for ecological (sage-grouse habitat) and economic (cattle

   alternative case scenarios that tested the effects of coordination among

   juniper treatment method. We found that sage-grouse conservation and
   forage production goals are somewhat complementary, but the extent of
   complementary benefits strongly depends on spatial factors and
   management approaches. Certain management actions substantially increase
   achievable benefits, including agency coordination and the use of
   prescribed burns to remove juniper. Critically, our results indicate
   that juniper management strategies designed to increase cattle forage do

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of fall and spring prescribed burning on the
   rare plant, Chrysothamnus molestus (Blake) L.C. Anders. Plant growth and
   flower production increased after fall burning, compared to control
   plants, indicating that C. molestus is tolerant of fall burning. There
   was a differential effect of fall burning on mature plants and
   seedlings. We did not observe any mortality in mature plants, but
   seedling establishment was reduced 12-fold compared to control plots
   that were not burned. Considering that seedling establishment in C.
   molestus is probably rare, burning during a year of sexual recruitment
   would likely have long-term negative effects on population dynamics. We
   also found strong seasonal differences caused by burning. The spring
   burn, which occurred during the growing season, led to 25 percent
   mortality of adult plants, a three-fold reduction in volume of surviving
   plants, with little or no compensation in growth or flower production.
   We conclude that C. molestus is not a fire-dependent species, but is
   tolerant of prescribed burns implemented after the growing season. We
   propose that prescribed bums should never be implemented during the
   growing season or at least in the early part of the growing season. Fall
   prescribed bums can be used as a management tool without negatively
   impacting C. molestus, but should not be implemented in a year when

Abstract = {{The effects of wildfire on wildlife are important considerations for
   resource managers because of recent interest in the role of fire in
   shaping forested landscapes in the western United States. This is
   particularly true of wildfire effects on spotted owls (Strix
   occidentalis) because of the uncertainty of impacts of controlled
   burning within spotted owl habitat. Therefore, we documented minimum
   survival, site, fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success for 21
   spotted owls after large (>540 ha) wildfires occurred within 11 owl
   territories in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. In each territory,
   fire burned through the nest and primary roost sites. Eighteen owls
   (86\%) were known to be alive at least 1 year after the fires, which was
   similar to reported annual adult survival probabilities for the species.
   Of 7 pairs of which both members were later resighted, all were located
   together on the same territories during the breeding season following
   fires, and 4 pairs produced a total of 7 fledglings. No pair separations
   were observed after fire. On 8 territories where fire severities were
   mapped, 50\% experienced predominantly low- to moderate-severity fires
   while 50\% experienced high-severity fires that burned large (>30\%)
   areas of the territories. We hypothesize that wildfires may have little
   short-term impact on survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and
   reproductive success of spotted owls. Further, prescribed burning could
   be an effective tool in restoring habitat to natural conditions with
   minimal short-term impact on resident spotted owls. While we do not
   advocate wholesale prescribed burning in spotted owl territories at this
   time, we believe our observations justify large-scale experiments on
   effects of prescribed burning on spotted owls to corroborate our
   observations and to establish cause-and-effect relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is used as a restoration and management technique in
   many deciduous forests of eastern North America. The effects of fire
   have been studied on habitat selection of many vertebrate species, but
   no studies have reported the effect of fire on bat roosting habitat.
   Fire initially leads to an influx of dead and dying trees, an increase
   of light availability, and a decrease of canopy and sub-canopy tree
   density. These characteristics are beneficial to many forest-dwelling
   vertebrates including cavity-roosting bats. We evaluated evening bat
   (Nycticeius humeralis) roost-site selection at the stand-scale in order
   to determine roosting preferences as they relate to prescribed burning.
   Standard radiotelemetry techniques were used to locate evening bat roost
   trees. Canopy light penetration and overstory tree density were measured
   in both burned and unburned forests. Sixty-three trees used as roosts by
   both male and female evening bats were located during both the summer
   and winter and all 63 roosts were located in the burned portion of the
   study area. Canopy light penetration was higher and canopy tree density
   was lower in the burned forest than unburned forest. An increase in
   light availability may release bats from one of the constraints
   suggested for many forest-dwelling bat species in roost tree
   selection-sun-exposure. This should increase the abundance of trees with
   characteristics suitable for roosting and may allow bats to roost
   throughout the interior of the forest as opposed to only on forest
   edges, thereby allowing bats to roost closer to foraging grounds and
   possibly lessening predation rates. Lower tree density may allow for
   ease of flight within the forest as well as more efficient locating of
   roost trees. In addition, there were a significantly higher proportion
   of dead trees, which evening bats commonly use as roost trees, in burned
   forests compared to unburned forests. Prescribed burning appears to
   initially lead to creation or restoration of favorable cavity-dwelling
   bat habitat and its continual implementation perpetuates an open
   sub-canopy. Therefore, we suggest that prescribed burning may be a
   suitable tool for management of roosting habitat for cavity-roosting
   bats. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Food resources and predation play important roles in determining small
   mammal population dynamics. These factors also can interact as
   individuals under predation pressure make trade-offs between access to
   food resources and exposure to predators. Fires consume food sources and
   reduce cover, which increases exposure to predators. For species that
   occur in areas with frequent fire, it is instructive to consider how all
   of these factors interact to affect populations of interest. We examined
   how supplemental feeding, mammalian predator exclusion, and prescribed
   fire affected survival, abundance, and reproduction of cotton mice
   (Peromyscus gossypinus) and oldfield mice (P. polionotus) in a longleaf
   pine ecosystem. Burning and predator exclusion interacted to affect
   survival of cotton mice; survival was similar in predator exclosures and
   controls in nonburning periods and in controls following prescribed
   burns but increased in exclosures following burns. Rates of transitions
   to reproductive states (which for females includes lactation or
   gravidity and for males, descent of testes) decreased in burn years but
   increased with the combination of feeding and predator exclusion.
   Supplemental feeding increased abundances. Among oldfield mice, survival
   and abundance were greater in predator exclusion areas than in controls.
   Supplemental feeding and the interaction of feeding and predator
   exclusion also increased abundances. During peak breeding seasons during
   which burning occurred rates of transitions to reproductive states
   declined to such an extent that reproductive transition rates in these
   seasons were lower than during nonpeak breeding seasons.}},

   ecosystems with high plant biodiversity. The southern Espinhaco
   mountains in Brazil are particularly important because they currently

   the best available data on the distribution of these threatened species,
   distribution of farming and mining activities, and up-to-date data on
   fire frequency, here we developed a systematic conservation plan for all
   these species and pinpointed priority regions for taking different
   conservation actions. We found that it is possible to protect, on
   average, more than 25\% of the threatened species ranges, avoiding sites
   with extensive use for farming and mining and favoring areas with
   intensive fire frequency while constraining the management to a
   relatively small area of only 17\% of the region. The analysis accounts
   for what is already protected within protected areas in the region and
   is, therefore, complementary to the work already held by the actors and
   environmental organizations of the region. We offer maps of priority
   areas with their respective level of protection and suggest conservation
   actions at different levels of engagement to be implemented in the

Abstract = {{1. Shrubland ecosystems are often inherently flammable due to a canopy
   structure favourable for fire propagation. At the same time, the fuel
   bed is not spatially uniform, but a complex mix of shrubs and herbaceous
   vegetation that will change with time since fire. These patterns are
   further influenced by megaherbivores capable of consuming large
   quantities of biomass that otherwise would enter the fuel bed, but the
   net effects for temporal thresholds of flammability are poorly known.
   2. We quantified post-fire fuel succession and effects of free-ranging
   cattle in high-elevation Erica shrublands in Ethiopia where traditional
   fire management is still practised above the treeline at 3500 m, despite
   being challenged by authorities.
   3. We found a near-linear accumulation of canopy fuel at 2 . 6 Mg ha(-1)
   year(-1), but stands <5 years old did not burn due to spatial separation
   of individual Erica shrubs before canopy closure and lack of fine dead
   fuels.
   4. Inside cattle exclosures, Erica height growth was nearly three times
   faster and reached the assumed flammability threshold c. 3 years earlier
   than in browsed/grazed stands, where cattle also kept herbaceous
   vegetation between shrubs short, thus eliminating litter that could
   otherwise bridge the discontinuous fuel bed in early succession.
   5. Modelling of fire behaviour indicated progressively higher fire
   intensity and rate of spread for stands >5 years. But if stands escape
   fire for several decades, flammability again decreases as canopy fuels
   become increasingly separated from the ground. This may be the ultimate
   reason for sharp treelines on many tropical mountains where fire is
   confined mainly to higher elevations.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In shrublands where dominant plants can
   outgrow consumption by large herbivores, provision of good cattle
   habitat typically requires fire. We found that fire and cattle interact
   to maintain a relatively stable system, where fuel limitation in early
   succession creates fire breaks that prevent landscape-wide wildfires.
   The same negative feedback protects the Erica from degradation by too
   frequent fires. As shrublands can have widely different compositions,
   the response to variation in fire frequency and herbivore pressure is
   likely to differ, but for sustainable management fire and grazing have
   to be treated in consort.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire has become a commonly used forest management tool for
   reducing the occurrence of severe wildfires, decreasing fuel loads and
   reestablishing the historic ecological influences of fire. Investigating
   population-level wildlife responses to prescribed fire is important for
   evaluating the effects of fire management on animals, but in order to
   predict and simulate wildlife responses to potential management actions,
   mechanistic studies that elucidate individual-level responses are also
   necessary. We used radio-frequency identification to investigate
   individual-level responses of western slimy salamanders Plethodon
   albagula to prescribed fire. We compared the salamander home-range sizes
   {[}minimum convex polygons (MCP)], movement behaviors, and activity
   levels before and after prescribed fire using a randomized block
   experiment. We initiated the study at three plots in 2011, and added two
   new plots in 2012. We captured, tagged and released 38 salamanders at
   each plot from May 2011-May 2012 (total N=205). We recorded 918 total
   recaptures of 142 unique salamanders; 31\% of tagged salamanders were
   never recaptured. Across all years and treatments, only 14\% of
   relocations were surface-active (i.e. visually confirmed) salamanders;
   the others were underground. Following prescribed fire, the
   surface-active proportion of recaptures was nearly seven times greater
   in control versus burned areas, which indicates that P.albagula respond
   to post-prescribed fire conditions by spending more time belowground. We
   did not find evidence of direct mortality of salamanders from fires; the
   proportion of known-alive individuals did not differ between treatments.
   Maximum daily displacement was 43.3\% higher among burn-area than
   control-area salamanders, and MCP varied in a similar pattern; this may
   indicate salamanders were attempting to find more hospitable
   microenvironments or other resources, such as prey. Together, these
   individual-level observations corroborate our findings from a
   population-level study of a congeneric terrestrial salamander and
   contribute to our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms underlying

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important management tool in east Africa as a way
   to improve foraging conditions for herbivores, and to make wildlife
   easier for tourists to observe and photograph. Although past research
   has investigated the factors influencing herbivore use of post-fire
   vegetation, the temporal dynamics of these effects have seldom been
   documented, and use of burned areas by African carnivores has not been
   evaluated. Between 2008 and 2011, we studied responses of 8 common
   herbivores and 8 carnivore species to burns in the Mara-Serengeti
   ecosystem in southwestern Kenya by monitoring mammal abundance on 4
   transects from up to 136 days before burning, and up to 748 days after
   burning. Among herbivores, zebra, warthog, Thomson's gazelle, Grant's
   gazelle, and topi, occurred in higher densities in burned than unburned
   areas. Impala and wildebeest showed trends toward occurring in higher
   densities in burned areas. These effects lasted up to 120 days for
   Thomson's gazelle, but we did not observe a specific temporal
   relationship to burning in the other 5 herbivore species. Both small and
   large carnivores were more likely to be observed along transects after
   than before burns; we observed small carnivores including black-backed
   jackals, side-striped jackals, bat-eared foxes, and banded mongoose in
   greater numbers up to 365 days after burns but observed large
   carnivores, including African lions, spotted hyenas, leopards, and
   cheetahs, in greater numbers only for up to 120 days after burns. Our
   results indicate that wildlife responses to prescribed fire last 1 year
   in this region. Although burning stimulates vegetation growth and
   improves wildlife visibility, managers should recognize that wildlife
   responses might not persist for more than a few months in tropical
   African savannas like the one monitored here. (c) 2014 The Wildlife

Abstract = {{Targeting conservation actions efficiently requires information on
   vulnerability of and threats to conservation targets, but such
   information is rarely included in conservation plans. In the U.S.,
   recently updated State Wildlife Action Plans identify Conservation
   Opportunity Areas (COAs) selected by each state as priority areas for
   future action to conserve wildlife and habitats. The question is how
   threatened these COAs are by habitat loss and degradation, major threats
   to wildlife in the U.S. that are often caused by housing development. We
   compiled spatial data on COAs across the conterminous U.S. We estimated
   COA vulnerability using current land protection status and COA threat
   using projected housing growth derived from U.S. census data. COAs
   comprise 1-46\% of each region. Across regions, 28-82\% of the area
   within COAs is vulnerable to future housing development, and 5-55\% and
   7-23\% of that vulnerable COA area is threatened by projected dense
   housing and rapid housing growth, respectively. COA vulnerability is
   greatest in the East. Threat from dense housing and rapid housing growth
   is highest in the Northeast and Pacific Southwest, respectively. Results
   highlight that many areas identified as important for reducing wildlife
   listings under the U.S. Endangered Species Act may need further
   protection to fulfill their conservation goals because they are both
   vulnerable to and threatened by future housing development. Our analyses
   can help practitioners target local government outreach, land protection
   efforts, and landscape-scale mitigation programs to decrease future COA
   loss from housing development, and could be expanded to address
   additional COA threats (e.g., wildfire, invasive species).}},

Title = {{Effects of Management Intervention on Post-Disturbance Community
   Composition: An Experimental Analysis Using Bayesian Hierarchical Models}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{As human demand for ecosystem products increases, management
   intervention may become more frequent after environmental disturbances.
   Evaluations of ecological responses to cumulative effects of management
   interventions and natural disturbances provide critical decision-support
   tools for managers who strive to balance environmental conservation and
   economic development. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects
   of salvage logging on avian community composition in lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks in Oregon, USA,
   1996-1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags
   only, and live trees were not harvested. We used a Bayesian hierarchical
   model to quantify occupancy dynamics for 27 breeding species, while
   accounting for variation in the detection process. We examined how
   magnitude and precision of treatment effects varied when incorporating
   prior information from a separate intervention study that occurred in a
   similar ecological system. Regardless of which prior we evaluated, we
   found no evidence that the harvest treatment had a negative impact on
   species richness, with an estimated average of 0.2-2.2 more species in
   harvested stands than unharvested stands. Estimated average similarity
   between control and treatment stands ranged from 0.82-0.87 (1 indicating
   complete similarity between a pair of stands) and suggested that
   treatment stands did not contain novel assemblies of species responding
   to the harvesting prescription. Estimated treatment effects were
   positive for twenty-four (90\%) of the species, although the credible
   intervals contained 0 in all cases. These results suggest that, unlike
   most post-fire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after
   beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the
   maintenance of avian community richness comparable to what is found in
   unharvested stands. Our results provide managers with prescription
   alternatives to respond to severe beetle outbreaks that continue to
   occur across extensive portions of the dry forests of western North
   America.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to characterize the vertical distribution of longhorned
   beetle larvae in burned trees of the eastern Canadian boreal forest.
   Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns \& Poggenb.) and
   jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) trees burned at three severity levels
   were cut, and 30 cm boles were collected from the ground up to a height
   of 9.45 m. Boles were debarked and dissected to collect insect larvae.
   Results show that the three most abundant longhorned beetle species were
   vertically segregated among burned jack pine and black spruce trees, but
   the section having the highest timber value was heavily infested by
   woodborer larvae. Larval density distribution of Monochamus scutellatus
   scutellatus (Say) and of Acmaeops proteus proteus (Kirby) could be
   linked with bark thickness, which also depends on fire severity. Lightly
   burned stands of black spruce were the most heavily infested and should
   be salvaged only if they are easily accessible and can thus be rapidly
   harvested and processed at the mill. More severely burned stands should
   be salvaged later as they will be less affected by woodborers, as should
   jack pine, which is lightly infested compared with black spruce. The
   ecological role of stumps should be further investigated because they
   could still have an ecological value after salvage logging as Arhopalus
   foveicollis (Haldeman) uses them specifically.}},

   years, with soil chemistry and foliar nutrient concentrations in three

   higher in the restored stands for at least I year following the most
   recent prescribed fire. However, only K concentrations were greater in

Title = {{Fire and grass cover influence occupancy patterns of rare rodents and

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{121-129}},
Abstract = {{Context. Feral cats (Felis catus) are implicated in the ongoing decline
   of Australian mammals. New research from northern Australia suggests
   that predation risk from feral cats could be managed by manipulating
   fire regimes to increase grass cover.
   Aims. We investigate the role of fire history and hummock grass cover in
   the occurrence of feral cats and rare rodents, including the critically
   endangered central rock-rat (Zyzomys pedunculatus), in a mountain refuge
   in central Australia.
   Methods. We installed 76 camera stations across four sites in the West
   MacDonnell National Park and used occupancy modelling to evaluate the
   influence of recent fire (within 5 years), hummock grass cover and
   ruggedness on feral cat and rodent occupancy.
   Key results. Occupancy of the central rock-rat was positively associated
   with areas burnt within the past 5 years a relationship probably driven
   by increased food resources in early succession vegetation. In contrast,
   the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) was detected at locations with
   dense hummock grass that had remained unburnt over the same period.
   Feral cats were widespread across the study area, although our data
   suggest that they forage less frequently in areas with dense hummock
   grass cover.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that fire management and grass cover
   manipulation can be used as a tool for rodent conservation in this
   environment and potentially elsewhere in arid Australia.
   Implications. Creating food-rich patches within dense hummock grasslands
   may allow central rock-rats to increase occupancy while simultaneously
   affording them protection from predation. Landscape-scale wildfire
   resulting in a single post-fire vegetation age class is likely to be
   unfavourable for native rodents in this environment.}},

Pages = {{963-972}},
Abstract = {{The extent to which prescribed fires affect forest structure and
   habitats of vertebrate species is an important question for land
   managers tasked with balancing potentially conflicting objectives of
   vegetation and wildlife management. Many insectivorous bats forage for
   insect prey in forested habitats, serving as the primary predators of
   nocturnal forest insects, and are potentially affected by structural
   changes in forests resulting from prescribed fires. We compared
   forest-stand characteristics of temperate oak-hickory forests, as
   measured with airborne laser scanning (light detection and ranging,
   LiDAR), with categorical estimates of burn severity from prescribed
   fires as derived from Landsat data and field-based Composite Burn
   Indices, and used acoustic monitoring to quantify activity of
   insectivorous bats in association with varying degrees of burn severity
   (unburned habitat, low severity and medium severity). Forest-stand
   characteristics showed greatest separation between low-severity and
   medium-severity classes, with gap index, i.e. open-air space, increasing
   with degree of burn severity. Greater mid-storey density, over-storey
   density and proportion of vegetation in the understorey occurred in
   unburned habitat. Activity of bats did not differ with burn severity for
   high-frequency (clutter-adapted or closed-space foragers) or
   low-frequency (edge or open-space foragers) bats. Results indicate that
   differing degrees of burn severity from prescribed fires produced
   spatial variation in canopy structure within stands; however, bats
   demonstrated no shifts in activity levels to this variation in canopy
   structure, suggesting prescribed fire during the dormant season, used as
   a management practice targeting desired changes in vegetation, is
   compatible with sustaining foraging habitat of insectivorous bats.}},

Abstract = {{Atlantic heaths are semi-natural habitats of high biodiversity interest
   which once covered large areas of the Atlantic Region. Nowadays these
   heathlands are dramatically reduced in many countries although they
   still cover wide areas in the north-west Iberian Peninsula, especially
   in the poorest and most socially marginal areas that are frequently
   affected by wildfires. We review the role of livestock grazing as a
   sustainable management strategy for heathlands in Europe. We have worked
   on a generalized conceptual framework for the management of a resource
   of nutritional and environmental value by drawing together evidence from
   studies of the livestock and the community ecology of grazed plants and
   the associated fauna. Key factors that influence grazing impact, such as
   type of livestock (animal species and breed) and their management are
   discussed. Goats thrive better than sheep, and horses than cattle, when
   heathland vegetation is the predominant resource available. Regardless
   of the type of livestock species managed, the low nutritive value of
   this vegetation hinders the maintenance of productive groups of suckler
   dams with offspring through the grazing season. The nutritional
   requirements of livestock can be met by adding improved pasture areas to
   heathlands. Under that strategy, sheep have the best productive
   performance and cattle the poorest. Management of mixed flocks with
   goats can lead to a more efficient use of vegetation, improve
   productivity and develop a patchier habitat which supports a richer
   associated fauna. Overall the results indicate that the sustainability
   of livestock grazing in these marginal lands will be achieved if they
   are managed effectively according to the available vegetation and their
   effects on the biodiversity.}},

   characteristics were also quantified on each plot. Density of all
   cavity-nesting birds combined and of Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides
   villosus) in particular were higher on the control than the salvage

Abstract = {{Our limited understanding of the short and long-term effects of fire on
   fish contributes to considerable uncertainty in assessments of the risks
   and benefits of fire management alternatives. A primary concern among
   the many potential effects of fire is the effects of fire and fire
   management on persistence of native fish populations. Limited evidence
   suggests vulnerability of fish to fire is contingent upon the quality of
   affected habitats, the amount and distribution of habitat (habitat
   fragmentation), and habitat specificity of the species in question.
   Species with narrow habitat requirements in highly degraded and
   fragmented systems are likely to be most vulnerable to fire and
   fire-related disturbance. In addition to effects of fire on native fish,
   there are growing concerns about the effects of fire on normative fish
   invasions. The role of fire in facilitating invasions by normative
   fishes is unknown, but experience with other species suggests some forms
   of disturbance associated with fire may facilitate invasion. Management
   efforts to promote persistence of fishes in tire-prone landscapes can
   take the form of four basic alternatives: (1) pre-fire management; (2)
   post-fire management; (3) managing fire itself (e.g. fire fighting); and
   (4) monitoring and adaptive management. Among these alternatives,
   pre-fire management is likely to be most effective. Effective pre-fire
   management activities will address factors that may render fish
   populations more vulnerable to the effects of fire (e.g. habitat
   degradation, fragmentation, and normative species). Post-fire management
   is also potentially important, but suffers from being a reactive
   approach that may not address threats in time to avert them. Managing
   fire itself can be important in some contexts, but negative consequences
   for fish populations are possible (e.g. toxicity of fire fighting
   chemicals to fish). Monitoring and adaptive management can provide
   important new information for evaluating alternatives, but proper
   implementation is often hampered by inadequate study designs and
   inconsistent financial and institutional support. The challenge for
   providing better management guidelines will be to add solid empirical
   data and models to assess the relevance of emerging concepts and
   theories, and provide a sense of where and when fires pose significant
   risks and/or benefits to fishes. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance is a crucial determinant of animal abundance, distribution
   and community structure in many ecosystems, but the ways in which
   multiple disturbance types interact remain poorly understood. The
   effects of multiple-disturbance interactions can be additive,
   subadditive or super-additive (synergistic). Synergistic effects in
   particular can accelerate ecological change; thus, characterizing such
   synergies, the conditions under which they arise, and how long they
   persist has been identified as a major goal of ecology. We factorially
   manipulated two principal sources of disturbance in African savannas,
   fire and elephants, and measured their independent and interactive
   effects on the numerically dominant vertebrate (the arboreal gekkonid
   lizard Lygodactylus keniensis) and invertebrate (a guild of symbiotic
   Acacia ants) animal species in a semi-arid Kenyan savanna. Elephant
   exclusion alone (minus fire) had negligible effects on gecko density.
   Fire alone (minus elephants) had negligible effects on gecko density
   after 4months, but increased gecko density twofold after 16months,
   likely because the decay of fire-damaged woody biomass created refuges
   and nest sites for geckos. In the presence of elephants, fire increased
   gecko density nearly threefold within 4months of the experimental burn;
   this occurred because fire increased the incidence of elephant damage to
   trees, which in turn improved microhabitat quality for geckos. However,
   this synergistic positive effect of fire and elephants attenuated over
   the ensuing year, such that only the main effect of fire was evident
   after 16months. Fire also altered the structure of symbiotic plant-ant
   assemblages occupying the dominant tree species (Acacia drepanolobium);
   this influenced gecko habitat selection but did not explain the
   synergistic effect of fire and elephants. However, fire-driven shifts in
   plant-ant occupancy may have indirectly mediated this effect by
   increasing trees' susceptibility to elephant damage. Our findings
   confirm the importance of fire x elephant interactions in structuring
   arboreal wildlife populations. Where habitat modification by
   megaherbivores facilitates co-occurring species, fire may amplify these
   effects in the short term by increasing the frequency or intensity of
   herbivory, leading to synergy. In the longer term, tree mortality due to
   both top kill by fire and toppling by large herbivores may reduce
   overall microhabitat availability, eliminating the synergy.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape context is known to affect species diversity patterns and can

   Prescribed fire and amount of dead wood, both on local and landscape
   scale, affected species richness and composition of several groups.
   There were interactions between local and landscape factors in five
   models out of six. Locally, we observed a positive response to flower
   richness for several groups, while the response to prescribed fire and
   dead wood amounts typically was affected by landscape factors. The
   results suggest that effectiveness of local conservation management is
   affected by landscape properties; the positive effects of local dead
   wood amounts and burning occurred on clearcuts in landscapes with large
   amounts of dead wood, but not in landscapes with small amounts of dead
   wood. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Relationship between wildfire, salvage logging, and occupancy of nesting

Abstract = {{The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is one of the most
   intensively studied raptors in the world; however, little is known about
   the impacts of wildfire on the subspecies and how they use recently
   burned areas. Three large-scale wildfires in southwest Oregon provided
   an opportunity to investigate the short-term impacts of wildfire and
   salvage logging on site occupancy of spotted owls. We used Program MARK
   to develop single-species, multiple-season models of site occupancy
   using data collected during demographic surveys of spotted owl
   territories. In our first analysis, we compared occupancy dynamics of
   spotted owl nesting territories before (19922002) and after the Timbered
   Rock burn (20032006) to a reference area in the south Cascade Mountains
   that was not affected recently by wildfire. We found that the South
   Cascades had greater colonization probabilities than Timbered Rock
   before and after wildfire (\$\{\textbackslash{}rm \{\textbackslash{}hat
   \{\textbackslash{}beta \}\}\} = 1.31\$, 95\% CI=0.602.03), and
   colonization probabilities declined over time at both areas
   (\$\{\textbackslash{}rm \{\textbackslash{}hat \{\textbackslash{}beta
   \}\}\} = - 0.06\$, 95\% CI=0.12 to 0.00). Extinction probabilities were
   greater at South Cascades than at Timbered Rock prior to the burn
   (\$\{\textbackslash{}rm \{\textbackslash{}hat \{\textbackslash{}beta
   \}\}\} = 0.69\$, 95\% CI=0.232.62); however, Timbered Rock had greater
   extinction probabilities following wildfire (\$\{\textbackslash{}rm
   \{\textbackslash{}hat \{\textbackslash{}beta \}\}\} = 1.46\$, 95\%
   CI=0.292.62). The Timbered Rock and South Cascades study areas had
   similar patterns in site occupancy prior to the Timbered Rock burn
   (19922001). Furthermore, Timbered Rock had a 64\% reduction in site
   occupancy following wildfire (20032006) in contrast to a 25\% reduction
   in site occupancy at South Cascades during the same time period. This
   suggested that the combined effects of habitat disturbances due to
   wildfire and subsequent salvage logging on private lands negatively
   affected site occupancy by spotted owls. In our second analysis, we
   investigated the relationship between wildfire, salvage logging, and
   occupancy of spotted owl territories at the Biscuit, Quartz, and
   Timbered Rock burns from 2003 to 2006. Extinction probabilities
   increased as the combined area of early seral forests, high severity
   burn, and salvage logging increased within the core nesting areas
   (\$\{\textbackslash{}rm \{\textbackslash{}hat \{\textbackslash{}beta
   \}\}\} = 1.88\$, 95\% CI=0.103.66). We were unable to identify any
   relationships between initial occupancy or colonization probabilities
   and the habitat covariates that we considered in our analysis where the
   coefficient did not overlap zero. We concluded that site occupancy of
   spotted owl nesting territories declined in the short-term following
   wildfire, and habitat modification and loss due to past timber harvest,
   high severity fire, and salvage logging jointly contributed to declines
   in site occupancy. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Historical range of variation (HRV) has been used as a conceptual tool
   to determine appropriate management actions to sustain or restore
   diversity of ecological systems. This concept has come into question for
   both biological and social considerations, and the southeastern United
   States is a good model system to test its utility. Southeastern Coastal
   Plain upland pine savannas and woodlands and their associated wetlands
   are among the most diverse communities in temperate North America,
   having both high levels of species richness and large numbers of endemic
   flora and fauna. However, this diversity is intimately linked with
   disturbance regimes. Maintaining frequent fire, varied in season based
   on changing management objectives through time, is the most important
   management tool for sustaining biodiversity. Moreover, the landscape has
   been molded by a long history of intense land use that has altered both
   the biological and the social landscape in which management occurs, and
   threatens the native diversity. Management must anticipate likely trends
   and adopt strategies that provide flexibility for managers to deal with
   the future, both socially and ecologically. In the Southeast, the most
   dominant trend is associated with urbanization and forest fragmentation,
   which results from urban sprawl. This issue joins others-fire and smoke,
   logging, access, in-holdings, and the uncertainty of scientific models,
   for example-as matters of major concern to the public. Ultimately, it is
   the public that eventually grants or withholds social permission to
   manage. We explore, here, the potential and the limitations for how
   history can inform future management. Rather than being used as a
   specific management tool, we find that one purpose for which HRV may be
   well suited is serving as a broad communication framework to help
   diverse publics understand the concept of landscape dynamics. This
   approach would provide the fundamental background material for
   stakeholders to understand how ecological conditions and social
   acceptability interact through time to mold and constrain future
   possible ranges of variability.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of fire on vegetation composition with the use of

   interval, 4-yr interval, and an intended control with no burning) over a
   27-yr period in an infertile, old-field grassland at the Cedar Creek

   measured the plant species' aboveground biomass in permanent plots in
   1983, 1987, 1991, 2000, and 2010. None of these fire frequencies, even
   after 27 yr, had a large impact on the vegetation composition. The plant
   functional groups' responses to fire frequency were consistent with
   their respective dominant species. The most abundant C-4 grass, little
   bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium Michx.), did not change in biomass
   with fire frequency over time. The biomass of the introduced, invasive
   grass, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) decreased significantly
   with increasing fire frequency, but this decrease did not result in
   change to the rate and trajectory of vegetation change. Bush clover
   (Lespedeza capitata Michx.), the only legume in the community, strongly
   increased with more frequent fire, but only after 20 yr. Species
   richness and litter mass decreased significantly with increasing fire
   frequency. These small fire-induced vegetation changes contrast with
   large fire-induced vegetation changes in fertile grasslands. Management
   strategies using fire in infertile grasslands can lower Poa abundance;
   however, increased fire also decreased overall plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of fire, forest insects and diseases, grazing, and forest health
   treatments on fish populations and habitat are reviewed. Fire, insects,
   and disease affect fish habitat by their influence on the rate and
   volume of woody debris recruitment to streams, canopy cover and water
   temperature, stream flow, channel erosion, sedimentation, nutrients, and
   residual vegetation. Physical effects from fire vary greatly depending
   on fire severity and extent, geology, soil, topography, and orientation
   of the site, and subsequent precipitation. Most effects moderate within
   a decade. Post-fire erosion and wood recruitment are also influenced by
   fire lines, road construction, and timber harvest. Although some
   disturbances, such as severe fire and subsequent floods, appear
   catastrophic, and effects may last decades or centuries, natural
   disturbances help create and maintain diverse, productive aquatic
   habitats. Recolonization of fish populations following wildfires can be
   rapid and is related to occurrence of local refugia, life history
   patterns, access for migratory forms, and distribution of the species.
   In most livestock studies, grazing negatively affected fish habitat and
   populations, but results may vary depending on sites and specific
   grazing management. Effective approaches to grazing management similarly
   depend on the specific application and the commitment of operators and
   managers. Restoration of the structure, function, and processes of
   watersheds more similar to those with which native species evolved may
   favor those species; however, there is little documentation of the
   aquatic effects of those activities. Risk from vegetative treatments may
   be minimized by experimenting outside of critical areas (i.e.,
   conserving key habitats and populations, focusing intensive treatments
   on upland sites). Use of more benign techniques (e.g., lower-impact
   logging systems) and pulsed treatments consistent with characteristics
   of natural disturbance regimes are other considerations for achieving
   both terrestrial and aquatic objectives.}},

Abstract = {{The response to prescribed burning of plant communities ranging from dry

   1993. Temporal controls for fire effects were provided by matched sets
   of plots protected from fire by newly constructed fire breaks. Changes
   in species composition were studied by ordination of strata of trees (>5
   cm DBH), small trees (2 - 5 cm DBH), large saplings (1 - 2 cm DBH), and
   small saplings and seedlings (50 - 140 cm tall). Results show that
   changes occurred largely in the small tree stratum, in which xeric
   species increased in importance. Although there were changes in sapling
   and seedling strata, no clear direction of change was recognized. Fire
   had little effect on the tree stratum.
   Of the seven community types under study, three types, sandhill, upland

   These short-term results indicate that changes in vegetation resulting

   differential effect of fire suggests that the influence of fire is
   secondary to that of topographical and soil gradients in determining

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Until recently, most contemporary ecologists have ignored or diminished
   anecdotal historical accounts and anthropologists' reports about
   aboriginal fire in the Great Basin. Literature review shows that Indians
   practiced regular use of fire for many purposes, including the obvious
   reasons of increasing the availability of desired plants, maintaining
   habitats for animals used as food, and driving game during hunts.
   Historical accounts of prehistoric anthropogenic firing, inferences from
   fire-scar data, and data regarding annual production capability of
   representative sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-perennial grass ecological
   sites indicate that prehistoric conditions were neither fuel- nor
   ignition-limited. According to many sources, this ``active
   management{''} by Indians was widespread, significant, and more common
   than lightning-caused fires, resulting in mosaic vegetation patterns
   that subsequently moderated the behavior of ``natural fires.{''} This
   interaction between Indian-burning and lightning fires may have strongly
   influenced the pre-Euro-American settlement vegetation of the Great
   Basin. At the very least, the landscape was a patchwork of areas altered
   by aboriginal people and areas shaped primarily by bio-physical
   processes. Based on this prehistoric precedent, current historically
   unprecedented conditions (fuel load and exotic weed invasion threats),
   and predicted climate change, contemporary active management of
   sagebrush-perennial grass communities is paramount. Restoration measures
   should be scientifically based and tailored to achieve ecological
   resilience and functionality in specific sites. Prescribed fire is not
   always ecologically appropriate or judicious, especially in Wyoming big
   sagebrush (A. tridentata spp. wyomingensis) communities, so managers
   should consider using other alternatives where an intentional low
   severity distubance is deemed necessary. Properly planned active
   management would disrupt fuel continuity for lighthning fires, ensure
   ecological process and successional integrity, and benefit multiple uses
   on a landscape scale.}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{We conducted a comparative hazard assessment for 325,000 ha in a
   fire-prone area of southwest Oregon, USA. The landscape contains a
   variety of land ownerships, fire regimes, and management strategies. Our
   comparative hazard assessment evaluated the effects of two management
   strategies on crown fire potential and northern spotted owl (Strix
   occidentalis caurina) conservation: (1) no action, and (2) active
   manipulation of hazardous fuels. Model simulations indicated that active
   management of sites with high fire hazard was more favorable to spotted
   owl conservation over the long term (75 years) than no management, given
   our modeling assumptions. Early in the model simulation, young seral
   stages were mostly responsible for high fire hazard, and active
   management in young stands tended to perpetuate that hazard. Later in
   the simulation, older seral stages accounted for most of the high fire
   hazard and active management could be used to ameliorate that hazard. At
   any given time period, <= 8\% of the landscape was identified for
   treatment. Fire hazard fluctuated over time depending on vegetation
   regeneration, maturation, and response to treatments. Active management
   resulted in greater numbers of potential spotted owl territories in
   lower fire hazard conditions, particularly during later years of our
   simulation. Our results support the contention that short term risks to
   protected species from active management can be less than longer term
   risk of no management in fire-prone landscapes. Thus, a short term, risk
   averse strategy for protected species in fire-prone landscapes may not
   be the best long term alternative for conservation. We caution that this
   finding warrants landscape-level field evaluation and structured
   adaptive management and monitoring prior to broad scale adoption as
   environmental policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Taxonomic impediments require us to know if simpler approaches such as
   using higher taxa or habitat surrogates can help assess the needs of
   invertebrates when managing forests. This study tests whether higher
   taxon (families for species) and habitat (vegetation structure for
   species and families) surrogates might assist in determining the effects
   of prescribed burning on spiders. Spiders were sampled at sites
   representing a chronosequence of increasing ages since burning (0, 3, 6
   and 9 years) by pitfall trapping and vacuuming from understorey
   vegetation in the Southwest Botanical Province of Australia; a global
   biodiversity hotspot. Reassembly followed a similar pattern for both the
   richness of species and families. Immediately following burning, mean
   richness of families and species was low (8.75 and 14.5, respectively).
   By 3 years, however, there were significant increases in familial and
   species richness (13.25 and 23.75, respectively). Thereafter, taxon
   richness remained constant. Multiple regressions suggested habitat
   variables potentially influencing family and species richness were
   litter depth, bare ground (\%), the density of dead vegetation (0-100 cm
   high), and the density of live vegetation (40-140 cm). The first three
   of these variables correlated significantly with time since burning,
   suggesting these components of habitat structure are useful predictors
   of taxon richness for spiders following fire. For assemblage
   composition, the congruence in post-fire response patterns between
   taxonomic ranks was highly significant, although the amount of variation
   explained was low (Rho < 0.55). In the first 9 years post-fire, there
   was a significant shift in the taxonomic composition of spiders at
   family, but not specific, rank. Family composition at recently burnt
   sites differed significantly from that at sites burnt 9 years
   previously. Correlated with assemblage composition were litter depth,
   bare ground, and the density of live vegetation (0-40 cm above the
   ground). However, the best correlation obtained by any combination of
   habitat variables with assemblage composition (Rho < 0.317) was less
   than that obtained by using family level data. We conclude, therefore,
   that where resources are limited and there is a need to determine the
   effects of forest management practices on invertebrates using
   surrogates, identifying spiders to higher taxa is better than relying on
   habitat structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of responses of understory plants to disturbance is
   essential for understanding the efficacy of management activities.
   However, the ability to assess changes in the abundance of plants may be
   hampered by inappropriate sampling methodologies. Conventional methods
   for sampling understory plants may be precise for common species but may
   fail to adequately characterize abundance of less common species. We
   tested conventional (modified Whittaker plots and Daubenmire and
   point-line intercept transects) and novel (strip adaptive cluster
   sampling {[}SACS]) approaches to sampling understory plants to determine
   their efficacy for quantifying abundance on control and
   thinned-and-burned treatment units in Pinus ponderosa forests in western
   Montana, USA. For species grouped by growth-form and for common species,
   all three conventional designs were capable of estimating cover with a
   50\% relative margin of error with reasonable sample sizes (3-36
   replicates for growth-form groups; 8-14 replicates for common species);
   however, increasing precision to 25\% relative margin of error required
   sample sizes that may be infeasible (11-143 replicates for growthform
   groups; 28-54 replicates for common species). All three conventional
   designs required enormous sample sizes to estimate cover of nonnative
   species as a group (29-60 replicates) and of individual less common
   species (62-118 replicates), even with a 50\% relative margin of error.
   SACS was the only design that efficiently sampled less common species,
   requiring only 6-11\% as many replicates relative to conventional
   designs. Conventional designs may not be effective for estimating
   abundance of the majority of forest understory plants, which are
   typically patchily distributed with low abundance, or of newly
   establishing nonnative plants. Novel methods such as SACS should be
   considered in investigations when cover of these species is of concern.}},

Abstract = {{Evergreen chaparral and semideciduous sage scrub shrublands were studied
   for five years after fires in order to evaluate hypothesized
   determinants of postfire recovery and succession. Residual species
   present in the immediate postfire environment dominated early
   succession. By the fifth year postfire, roughly half of the species were
   colonizers not present in the first year, but they comprised only 7-14\%
   cover. Successional changes were evaluated in the context of
   four,hypotheses: (1) event-dependent, (2) fire interval, (3)
   self-regulatory, and (4) environmental filter hypotheses.
   Characteristics specific to the fire event, for example, fire severity
   and annual fluctuations in precipitation, were important determinants of
   patterns of change in cover and density, supporting the
   ``event-dependent{''} hypothesis. The ``fire interval{''} hypothesis is
   also supported, primarily through the impact of short intervals on
   reproductive failure in obligate seeding shrubs and the impact of long
   intervals on fuel accumulation and resultant fire severity. Successional
   changes in woody cover were correlated with decreases in herb cover,
   indicating support for ``self-regulatory{''} effects. Across this
   landscape there were strong ``environmental filter{''} effects that
   resulted in complex patterns of postfire recovery and succession between
   coastal and interior associations of both vegetation types.
   Of relevance to fire managers is the finding that postfire recovery
   patterns are substantially slower in the interior sage scrub formations,
   and thus require different management strategies than coastal
   formations. Also, in sage scrub (but not chaparral), prefire stand age
   is positively correlated with fire severity, and negatively correlated
   with postfire cover. Differential responses to fire severity Suggest
   that landscapes with combinations of high and low severity may lead to
   enhanced biodiversity. Predicting postfire management needs is

Abstract = {{Bark beetle-caused tree mortality in conifer forests affects the
   quantity and quality of forest fuels and has long been assumed to
   increase fire hazard and potential fire behavior. In reality, bark
   beetles, and their effects on fuel accumulation, and subsequent fire
   hazard, are poorly understood. We extensively sampled fuels in three
   bark beetle-affected Intermountain conifer forests and compared these
   data to existing research on bark beetle/fuels/fire interactions within
   the context of the disturbance regime. Data were collected in endemic,
   epidemic and post-epidemic stands of Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine and
   Engelmann spruce. From these data, we evaluated the influence of bark
   beetle-caused tree mortality on various fuels characteristics over the
   course of a bark beetle rotation. The data showed that changes in fuels
   over time create periods where the potential for high intensity and/or
   severe fires increases or decreases. The net result of bark beetle
   epidemics was a substantial change in species composition and a highly
   altered fuels complex. Early in epidemics there is a net increase in the
   amount of fine surface fuels when compared to endemic stands. In
   post-epidemic stands large, dead, woody fuels, and live surface fuels
   dominate. We then discuss potential fire behavior in bark
   beetle-affected conifer fuels based on actual and simulated fuels data.
   Results indicated that for surface fires both rates of fire spread and
   fireline intensities were higher in the current epidemic stands than in
   the endemic stands. Rates of spread and fireline intensities were higher
   in epidemic stands due, however, to decreased vegetative sheltering and
   its effect on mid-flame wind speed, rather than changes in fuels.
   Passive crown fires were more likely in post-epidemic stands, but active
   crown fires were less likely due to decreased aerial fuel continuity. We
   also discuss the ecological effects of extreme fire behavior.
   Information is presented on managing forests to reduce the impact of
   bark beetle outbreaks and the interplay between management, bark beetle
   populations, fuels and fire hazard and behavior. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Riparian habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington compose a small
   percentage of the landscape, and yet these habitats are essential for
   many species of vertebrates. Riparian areas are sensitive to disturbance
   agents, which can pose a formidable challenge to effective management of
   these habitats. Moreover, few studies have documented the effects of
   disturbance agents on riparian habitats and associated fauna. In
   general, disturbances from insects and disease likely have-strong
   effects on cavity nesters and insect feeders, and use of Bt (Bacillus
   thuringiensis) to control insect pests decreases the food supply for
   insectivores. Most fire effects on terrestrial vertebrates are through
   changes in habitat, food, and competitors, and responses to fire are
   variable and species specific. Salvage logging likely has negative
   effects for species that use dead and dying trees. Livestock grazing in
   riparian areas can eliminate nesting substrates, alter habitat structure
   and composition, compact soil, trample banks, encourage cowbird
   expansion, and increase exotic plants. The magnitude of these effects
   depends on the timing and intensity of grazing. There are almost no
   studies on how landscape-level vegetation patterns (including riparian
   corridors) contribute to the viability of wildlife populations. Managers
   have usually chosen to buffer riparian areas from harvest, spraying, and
   prescribed fire, but there are no decision-support tools or guidelines
   for management of riparian habitat for terrestrial vertebrates.}},

Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in mature forest cover amount, composition, and configuration
   can be of significant consequence to wildlife populations. The response
   of wildlife to forest patterns is of concern to forest managers because
   it lies at the heart of such competing approaches to forest planning as
   aggregated vs. dispersed harvest block layouts. In this study, we
   developed a species assessment framework to evaluate the outcomes of
   forest management scenarios on biodiversity conservation objectives.
   Scenarios were assessed in the context of a broad range of forest
   structures and patterns that would be expected to occur under natural
   disturbance and succession processes. Spatial habitat models were used
   to predict the effects of varying degrees of mature forest cover amount,
   composition, and configuration on habitat occupancy for a set of 13
   focal songbird species. We used a spatially explicit harvest scheduling
   program to model forest management options and simulate future forest
   conditions resulting from alternative forest management scenarios, and
   used a process-based fire-simulation model to simulate future forest
   conditions resulting from natural wildfire disturbance. Spatial pattern
   signatures were derived for both habitat occupancy and forest
   conditions, and these were placed in the context of the simulated range
   of natural variation. Strategic policy analyses were set in the context
   of current Ontario forest management policies. This included use of
   sequential time-restricted harvest blocks (created for Woodland caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus) conservation) and delayed harvest areas (created for
   American marten (Martes americana atrata) conservation). This approach
   increased the realism of the analysis, but reduced the generality of
   interpretations. We found that forest management options that create
   linear strips of old forest deviate the most from simulated natural
   patterns, and had the greatest negative effects on habitat occupancy,
   whereas policy options that specify deferment and timing of harvest for
   large blocks helped ensure the stable presence of an intact mature
   forest matrix over time. The management scenario that focused on
   maintaining compositional targets best supported biodiversity objectives
   by providing the composition patterns required by the 13 focal species,
   but this scenario may be improved by adding some broad-scale spatial
   objectives to better maintain large blocks of interior forest habitat
   through time.}},

Abstract = {{Moorlands provide several key ecosystem services, as well as supporting
   shooting of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica Latham). Prescribed
   burning of heather is an integral aspect of grouse-moor management but
   is sometimes presented as ecologically damaging. However, a long-term
   burning experiment at Moor House National Nature Reserve, North
   Pennines, northern England, showed that more frequent burning actually
   increased the cover of peat-building species such as Sphagnum mosses and
   cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum L.). Here we compare those findings
   with data from another deep-peat site in the North Pennines, but one
   that is actively managed as a grouse moor. We describe post-fire
   vegetation change using aerial images to construct a time-series of
   burns. Comparable with the Moor House study, we found highest levels of
   Sphagnum and Eriophorum cover on fires last burned within 3-10 years,
   whereas heather (Calluna vulgaris L.) cover, that of other mosses, and
   overall vegetation height all increased in a linear manner over time
   since burning. These results from an actively managed grouse moor
   subject to prescribed burning demonstrate that the cover and species
   richness of Sphagnum, a key peat-forming group, correlated with reduced
   dominance of tall heather, can benefit from a post-burn period of up to
   10 years.}},

Title = {{Effects of large-scale high-severity fire on occupancy and abundances of
   an invasive large mammal in south-eastern Australia}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{555-564}},
Abstract = {{Context. Despite large mammals being an important component of many
   ecosystems, there is little information on the impacts of fire on large
   mammal populations.
   Aims. We evaluated the effects of the large-scale high-severity `Black
   Saturday' fires of 7 February 2009 on occupancy and abundances of an
   invasive large mammal, the sambar deer (Cervus unicolor), in
   south-eastern Australia.
   Methods. The effects of the Black Saturday fires on the abundance of
   sambar deer were assessed using repeated annual counts of faecal pellets
   during 2007-11 in Kinglake National Park, which was burnt, and in Mount
   Buffalo National Park, which was not burnt. Pre-fire occupancy was
   modelled from data collected at 80 4-km(2) cells using three survey
   methods. The same survey methods were used at 15 burnt (n = 9 sampled
   pre-fire) and 15 unburnt (n = 5 sampled pre-fire) cells 16-24 months
   after Black Saturday. Because multiple surveys were performed in each
   cell, we used a Bayesian state-space site-occupancy model to partition
   changes in the probability of occupancy from changes in the probability
   of detection.
   Key results. Counts of sambar deer pellets increased linearly during
   2007-11 in the unburnt Mount Buffalo National Park. Pellet counts also
   increased linearly in Kinglake National Park from 2007 to 2008, and then
   decreased (to zero) following Black Saturday; pellet counts increased
   again in 2010 and 2011. Sambar deer occupancy was weakly reduced (from
   0.99 to 0.88) in burnt cells 16-24 months after Black Saturday, but was
   little changed in unburnt cells (from 0.99 to 0.98).
   Conclusions. We conclude that the abundance of sambar deer was
   substantially reduced by the large-scale high-severity Black Saturday
   fires, but that most burnt habitat was reoccupied 16-24 months later.
   Implications. There is concern about the negative impacts of invasive
   sambar deer on native biodiversity, particularly immediately post-fire.
   Our study suggests that it takes at least 8 months before sambar deer
   recolonise areas burnt by a large-scale high-severity fire; however, a
   risk-averse approach would be to act (e.g. by erecting fences or
   culling) sooner than that.}},

Abstract = {{Successful regeneration of oaks on better sites (SI50>60) has proven
   difficult in recent decades due to competition from faster growing
   species and well-established advanced regeneration from more
   shade-tolerant species. The suppression of fire is thought to have
   played a critical role in allowing this largely fire-intolerant
   competition to dominate many upland hardwood forests at the expense of
   oaks. As part of a larger study examining the role of prescribed fire in
   regenerating upland oaks, seasonal prescribed bums were applied to
   first-stage shelterwood harvested stands on Horsepen WMA in the Virginia
   Piedmont in 1995. We surveyed small mammal communities in these stands
   to assess the impact of such fires on this component of the fauna. Over
   a combined 34,000 snap-trap and pitfall trapnights, we found no
   significant differences in relative abundance of,white-footed mice
   (Peromyscus leucopus), southeastern shrews (Sorex longirostris) pygmy
   shrews (Sorex hoyi) or southern short-tailed shrews (Blarina
   carolinensis) among unburned shelterwood stands and those treated with
   winter, spring, or summer bums. Based on our results, prescribed burning
   in these shelterwood stands is not adversely impacting small mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is now widely used in ecosystems in Mediterranean
   regions as an efficient management practice to reduce both the
   quantities of fuel biomass and the fire frequency, seasonality,
   intensity and size. The regime of prescribed burning should be adapted
   to maintain the biological diversity and impact on population dynamics
   must be determined. We studied the effect of prescribed burning on the
   capture and survival rates of a population of small mammals, the wood
   mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) in the Mediterranean region of Torderes,
   France. To this end, we used a rectangular trapping quadrat measuring
   300 x 225 m(2), in which 1366 individuals were captured and marked over
   a total of 18 trapping sessions (May 1991-June 1996). Several prescribed
   fires were ignited between the fifth and sixth trapping sessions. These
   multiple fires resulted in a partial burning of the study site, which
   left a number of small patches of vegetation intact. To estimate the
   influence of this prescribed burning on capture and survival rates of
   the wood mouse, the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model was fitted. Likelihood
   ratio test and AIC criterion allowed us to select the most parsimonious
   model for our survival data, the additive model Phi(s+t). This model did
   not demonstrate any significant change in survival rates after the
   prescribed fires, probably because the fire left behind small patches of
   vegetation and the wood mouse can quickly recolonize the study site. Our
   result is in accordance with other studies, which found little impact of
   prescribed burning on survival rates and abundance in animal
   populations. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Abstract = {{Wildfires are the most extensive and severe disturbance affecting the
   shrublands where Sardinian and Dartford Warblers (Sylvia melanocephala
   and S. undata) abound. Estimating the long-term use of burned habitats
   by these species (i.e. their time-window of occurrence) is fundamental
   to understanding their regional distribution and to plan possible
   conservation measures for the near-threatened Dartford Warbler. In this
   study, we describe the post-fire time-window of occurrence and cover
   preferences of the two warblers using an abundance dataset, gathered by
   point counts over 22 consecutive years, and a density dataset, resulting
   from territory mapping of four different plots for up to 8 years. Both
   datasets span before and after fire. The two species colonized burned
   areas as soon as the second year after fire. The Dartford Warbler showed
   its highest abundance between 4 and 9 years after fire and disappeared
   after 16 years or more. The Sardinian Warbler had a peak of abundance at
   9 years, but the study was not long enough to record its local
   extinction. Partial least squares regression showed that abundance at
   points and plot density of the Dartford Warbler were positively related
   to the plant cover between 0.25 and 1 m, whereas vegetation between 0.5
   and 4 m was important for the Sardinian Warbler. The Dartford Warbler,
   therefore, depends on the existence of dense and low shrublands, that
   are often the result of past fires.}},

Abstract = {{Rocky outcrops are geological features that encompass a wide variety of
   physical environments, including escarpments, overhangs, cliffs, tors,
   boulder-heaps and insular domes (inselbergs). They support high levels
   of species diversity and endemism, and provide stable micro-climates for
   thousands of years. They provide critical breeding sites for many top
   order mammalian and avian predators; nesting sites for colonial species
   such as seabirds, bats and swifts and ecological refuges for ancient
   lineages. Rock overhangs and caves also provide important insights into
   our ecological past where they contain the remains of extinct species.
   Because rocky environments are generally less fertile, steep-sided and
   less accessible than the surrounding landscape, they are typically less
   prone to human disturbances. Nonetheless, many rocky outcrops,
   particularly in commodity production landscapes, face a variety of
   threats including soil compaction and erosion caused by livestock;
   nutrient enrichment and weed invasion; introduced predators; and
   physical damage caused by recreational and quarrying activities. Even
   rocky outcrops in seemingly pristine environments may be affected by
   altered fire regimes, air pollution (including acid rain) and
   potentially dimate change. In agricultural landscapes, various
   approaches have been taken to conserve rocky outcrops, including land
   acquisition for conservation, fencing from livestock and private land
   conservation agreements with landholders. In more intact landscapes,
   targeted actions to conserve rock-dwelling fauna include limiting human
   access to critical breeding sites, baiting to reduce pressure from
   introduced predators, restoring rock microhabitat and translocation of
   endangered species. Future management actions will need to involve
   better inventory of the biophysical attributes and fine-scale mapping to
   improve the awareness of these small natural features. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Oak (Quercus spp.) savannas have declined drastically in the midwestern
   United States since European settlement. Oak savanna restoration
   projects are primarily driven by species closely linked to this habitat
   type, such as the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides
   melissa samuelis). However, it is essential that other species are
   monitored during restoration. Small mammals, due to their importance in
   ecosystem function, are particularly useful to study. The United States
   Forest Service is currently conducting an oak savanna restoration in the
   Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan using forest thinning and
   prescribed burning. To understand management impacts on small mammal
   communities, we live trapped small mammals in each of the mechanically
   thinned plots (i.e., bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter) and
   control plots in five blocks over six years (2008-2013), as well as
   measured vegetation variables each year. Initially, we used a
   permutation multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to determine
   if there were treatment and year interactions for both small mammal
   community assemblages and vegetation variables. We then compared changes
   in small mammal diversity, relative abundance, and vegetation variables
   among treatments using exploratory randomized block design analysis of
   variances (ANOVAs). Canopy cover was significantly lower in bulldozer
   and shear cutter thinned plots than control plots five years following
   thinning. We observed significant treatment by year interactions in how
   the small mammal community responded. A large increase in relative
   abundance of white-footed mice occurred one year post-thinning in all
   treatments. Within 1-2 years of treatment, thirteen-lined ground
   squirrels and meadow jumping mice, both open-canopy grassland species
   became established on thinned plots. The retention of brush piles in
   bulldozer and shear cutter plots provided important refuge habitat for
   small mammals following thinning, Restoration efforts were beneficial to
   the small mammal community overall and promoted grassland species to
   immigrate into the restored area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Restoration of many terrestrial plant communities involves the
   reintroduction of fire. However, there have been few studies of the
   effects of fire on the avifauna during the restoration process. To study
   the effects of oak savanna restoration on avian communities, breeding
   birds were censused and the vegetation structure documented in seven
   experimental burn units (8-18 ha) that had experienced different
   frequencies of controlled burns during the past 31 years (0-26 burns).
   Data were analyzed with both direct and indirect gradient analyses using
   multivariate techniques. The results showed that, as savanna restoration
   proceeded, there was a general decline in predominantly insectivorous
   species, particularly those that feed in the upper canopy region (leaves
   and air space), and a general increase in omnivorous species,
   particularly those that feed on the ground and in the lower canopy.
   Insectivorous bark gleaners (woodpeckers) also increased during
   restoration and were correlated with the increase in standing dead trees
   resulting from the fires. Overall, savanna restoration resulted in
   increases in the abundance of many open country bird species, including
   many species that have been declining in central and eastern North
   America, including red-headed woodpecker, Baltimore oriole, eastern
   kingbird, vesper sparrow, field sparrow, lark sparrow, brown thrasher,
   American goldfinch, and brown-headed cowbird. The shifts in species and
   guilds were correlated with changes in burn frequency and the macro
   vegetation structure-tree and shrub density, leaf area index, and
   relative proportion of standing dead trees. The findings show that
   savanna restoration can increase bird diversity and provide important
   habitat for uncommon or declining bird species. These birds are most
   likely attracted to one or more of the distinctive habitat features of
   the restored savanna environments, including scattered mature trees,
   standing dead trees and snags, and presence of both shrubby and
   grassland vegetation. The findings also suggest that restoration
   ecologists and wildlife biologists will need to work together to achieve
   desired goals, since different types of savanna restoration efforts may
   produce different effects on the breeding bird community.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is routinely used to improve grazing in Pyrenean
   rangelands affected by an overall trend of land abandonment. This study
   considers the environmental variables influencing habitat occupancy by
   birds and the consequences of the use of fire in range management for
   bird conservation. Bird use and habitat structure of 11 cover types, the
   result of specific management regimes, were monitored for two breeding
   seasons in a mosaic landscape. Three main gradients of avian
   composition, corresponding to tree cover, shrub volume and grazing
   intensity, were identified from canonical correspondence analysis. The
   structure of the bird community seemed more intensely affected by
   species-specific selection of cover types than by the birds' use of
   multiple patches. Out of a total of 10 bird species analysed by a
   simultaneous confidence intervals procedure, four species with an
   unfavourable conservation status in Europe (Emberiza cia, Lullula
   arborea, Saxicola torquata and Lanius collurio) preferred managed
   grassland. Three types of grassland with shrubs (derived from single or
   repeated burning) had the highest bird conservation index (taking into
   account specific status and abundance of the bird assemblage), whereas
   forests showed middle or low values. The relation (P = 0.054) of this
   index to the logarithm of the pastoral value (which includes density and
   grazing quality of grasses) in currently managed cover types suggests
   that the objectives of grassland recovery by appropriate management
   practices and those of bird conservation coincide in our study area.}},

Abstract = {{A key issue for forest and rangeland health and productivity in eastern
   Oregon and Washington is invasive species. Although some exotic plant
   introductions were accidental, many were intentional for wildlife
   habitat improvement, ornamental purposes, wood or fiber production, soil
   conservation, livestock forage production, or other crop uses. Exotic
   species, or weeds, can be a significant component of global
   environmental change because of their potential to alter primary
   productivity, decomposition, hydrology, nutrient cycling, and natural
   disturbance regimes. At smaller scales, they alter the structure,
   composition, and successional pathways of ecosystems. They lower
   diversity by out-competing native plants. Disturbance caused by forest
   restoration activities (thinning and prescribed fire) can promote weed
   spread, but ultimately will improve native plant diversity and
   productivity, improving ecosystem resistance to weed invasion.
   Restoration strategies need to include consideration of weed prevention
   and control and restoration of natives. Prevention includes restoring
   ecosystem processes; control includes biological, manual, mechanical,
   herbicidal, and prescribed burning methods; restoration involves
   returning native plants to a site. Monitoring is important to provide
   managers with information that will allow them to evaluate restoration
   activities and modify ineffective restoration approaches.}},

Title = {{Wildfire impacts on California spotted owl nesting habitat in the Sierra
   Nevada}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{California spotted owls (CSOs) (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) have
   received significant conservation attention beginning with the U.S.
   Forest Service interim management guidelines in 1992. The most commonly
   reported forest habitat feature for successful nesting habitat of CSO is
   canopy cover >70\%. Loss and degradation of Sierra Nevada CSO habitat,
   however, has been a growing concern, initially from commercial tree
   harvesting and, more recently, from wildfire. This study examined trends
   in wildfire impacts on potential nesting habitat of the CSO and
   discusses different management approaches that might lead to the
   conservation of CSO in fire-dependent forests. A total of 85,046 ha of
   CSO potential nesting habitat was burned by fire that resulted in >=
   50\% tree basal area (BA) mortality, reducing canopy cover on average to
   <25\%, during 2000-2014; this included 2.7\%, 12.3\%, and 7.6\% of dense
   red fir (Abies magnifica), eastside pine, and westside forests,
   respectively. Based on regression predictions, within the next 75 yr,
   the cumulative amount of nesting habitat burned at >= 50\% tree basal
   area mortality will exceed the total existing habitat. Four management
   strategies are discussed that could enhance the conservation of the CSO:
   (1) increased fire suppression, (2) strategically reducing fire hazards
   using mechanical treatments and/or prescribed fire, (3) increasing the
   amount of managed wildfire in CSO habitat, and (4) developing a
   landscape strategy that uses historical forest structure information to
   identify areas where high-canopy cover forests are more sustainable. Our
   estimates of how moderate-and high-severity fire may affect forests into
   the future poise a substantial threat to CSO persistence. More
   comprehensive forest restoration activities may be needed in CSO habitat
   to avoid significant losses of older forests.}},

   options for enhancing the resistance and resilience of forests to

   Among the land-use and management practices likely to maintain forest

   representing forest types across environment gradients in reserves; (2)
   protecting climatic refugia at multiple scales; (3) protecting primary

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is an often used and economical management tool to
   manage for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and eastern
   cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Although prescribed fire
   creates and maintains early successional plant communities that benefit
   cottontails, short-term effects (direct and indirect) of prescribed
   burning on cottontails are unclear. To document cottontail response to
   fire, we examined pre- and post-burn home range (HR) and core area (CA)
   size, post-bum movement rates, and post-bum survival and cause-specific
   mortality rates for 10 cottontails (BURN) that inhabited sites burned
   with prescribed fire on Black Prairie Wildlife Management Area in
   Mississippi during 1998 and 10 cottontails (UNBURN) selected randomly
   that inhabited unburned sties. We observed no direct mortality from
   prescribed bums. Cottontails moved a mean distance of 84.9 m (SE=18.0)
   immediately after the bum, with 9 of 10 marked cottontails emigrating
   from burned fields. We observed no statistical differences between
   treatments (BURN vs. UNBURN) for pre-burn home range (HR; 3.57 ha vs.
   3.58 ha) and core area sizes (CA; 0.46 ha vs. 0.45 ha), post-bum HR
   (6.17 ha vs. 3.76 ha) and CA (0.94 ha vs. 0.58 ha), overall movement

   m/hour), survival rate (0.200 vs. 0.480), mammalian cause-specific
   mortality rate (0.296 vs. 0.206), and unknown predator cause-specific

   post-bum nocturnal movement rate (58.1 m/hour vs 28.8 m/hour) and avian
   cause-specific mortality rate (0.493 vs. 0.103). Percentage use of
   individual fields that were burned declined following the fires (pre-

   0.141),and nocturnal (0.827 vs. 0.390)periods. Our observations provide

Abstract = {{We used simulation modeling to analyze wildfire exposure to social and
   ecological values on a 0.6 million ha national forest in central Oregon,
   USA. We simulated 50,000 wildfires that replicated recent fire events in
   the area and generated detailed maps of burn probability (BP) and fire
   intensity distributions. We also recorded the ignition locations and
   size of each simulated fire and used these outputs to construct a fire
   source-sink ratio as the ratio of fire size to burn probability. Fire
   behavior was summarized for federal land management designations,
   including biological conservation reserves, recreational sites, managed
   forest, and wildland urban interface. Burn probability from the
   simulations ranged from 0.00001 to 0.026 within the study area (mean =
   0.0023), and exhibited substantial variation among and within land
   designations. Simulated fire behavior was broadly related to gradients
   in fire regimes, although the combined effects of fuel, topography, and
   simulated weather resulted in fine scale patterns not reflected in
   ecological and vegetation data. Average BP for the northern spotted owl
   (Strix occidentalis caurina) nesting sites ranged from 0.0002 to 0.04.
   Among the 130 different wildland urban interface areas, average BP
   varied from 0.0001 to 0.02. Spatial variation in the source-sink ratio
   was pronounced, and strongly affected by the continuity and arrangement

Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Habitat selection that has fitness consequences has important
   implications for conservation activities. For example, habitat
   characteristics that influence nest success in birds can be manipulated
   to improve habitat quality with the goal of ultimately improving
   reproductive success. We examined habitat selection by the threatened
   streaked horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata) at both the
   breeding-site (territory) and nest-site scales. Larks were selective at
   both spatial scales but with contrasting selection. At the territory
   scale, male larks selected sparsely vegetated grasslands with relatively
   short vegetation. At the nestsite scale, female larks selected sites
   within territories with higher vegetation density and more perennial
   forbs. These nest-site scale choices had reproductive consequences, with
   greater nest success in areas with higher densities of perennial forbs.
   We experimentally manipulated lark habitat structure in an attempt to
   mimic the habitat conditions selected by larks by using late summer
   prescribed fires. After the burn, changes in vegetation structure were
   in the direction preferred by larks but habitat effects attenuated by
   the following year. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating
   habitat selection at spatial scales appropriate to the species of
   interest, especially when attempting to improve habitat quality for rare
   and declining species. They also highlight the importance of conducting
   restoration activities in a research context. For example, because the
   sparsely vegetated conditions created by fire attenuate, there may be
   value in examining more frequent burns or hotter fires as the next
   management and research action. We hope the design outlined in this
   study will serve as an integrated research and management example for
   conserving grassland birds generally.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies
   vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence
   on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is
   sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire
   salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently
   burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local
   species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites
   (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after
   a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and
   Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at
   non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that
   rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major,
   Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula),
   mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides
   tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while
   species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as
   whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed
   shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more
   common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea
   that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird
   species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that
   although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring
   in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species
   richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical
   forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation
   concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging
   in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing
   management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate
   long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked

   Strategies: A Case Study from the Western Himalayas of India}},
Journal = {{SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY}},
Abstract = {{Human activities coupled with over exploitation of sensitive ecosystems
   and habitat destruction have caused a rapid decrease in the population
   of plant species. Countries worldwide are becoming interested in
   conserving biodiversity by determining conservation priorities at local
   levels. The categories used for evaluating threat status by the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that were
   originally planned for the global level are now increasingly used at
   national and local levels. The present study deals with the assessment
   of vegetation and further prioritization of habitats, communities, and
   species for its conservation in the Shimla water catchment Sanctuary in
   the Western Himalayas of India. Adoption of such methods not only
   generates quantitative data about the floristic diversity of the area
   but also help policy makers and forest managers in the formulation of
   conservation strategies for proper management of protected areas. A
   conservation priority index (CPI) was used to prioritize based on
   various attributes that are complementary to IUCN criteria. Among the
   tree communities,Cedrus deodara-Quercus leucotrichophora,Picea
   smithiana, andQuercus leucotricophora-Quercus floribundacommunities
   showed maximum CPIs scores (54 each) followed by theQuercus
   semecarpifolia(52),Abies pindrow-Taxus baccata,Aesculus indica(46 each),
   andCedrus deodara-Pinus wallichiana(i.e. 44 each) communities. The
   remaining tree communities showed relatively low CPI values. Among shrub
   communities, theBerberis lycium-Indigofera heterantha-Cotoneaster
   microphylluscommunity showed highest CPI score (42), hence should be
   prioritized for conservation. The remaining shrub communities showed
   comparatively low CPI values. Among the habitats-dry habitats showed
   highest CPI score (48), followed by shady moist and water courses (46
   each) and exposed (44) habitats. Among the identified species, 10 were
   identified as critically endangered, 31 as endangered, 48 as vulnerable
   and 30 species as near threatened and were accordingly prioritized for
   conservation. The present study emphasizes on community, habitat and
   species specific management of this forest ecosystem for effective
   management by the forest managers and policy makers. Regular monitoring
   of prioritized habitats and communities is suggested while management
   and restoration of habitats and communities with low CPI values.
   People's participation, training, and interactive workshops are
   essential in order to minimize structural and functional alterations due
   to overexploitation and habitat degradation. Forest fires and invasion
   by non-native species are other issues to monitor.}},

   and resource management practices. To assess satellite-derived measures
   of burn severity in Alaska we calculated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)
   from pre- and post-fire Landsat TM/ETM+ data. We established 289
   composite burn index (CBI) plots in or near four national park areas
   between 2001 and 2003 in order to compare ground-based measurements of
   burn severity with satellite-derived values of burn severity. Within the
   diverse vegetation types measured, a strong linear relationship between
   a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and CBI for eight out of the
   nine fire assessments was found; R-2 values ranged from 0.45 to 0.88.
   The variations in severity among four pre- fire vegetation types were
   examined and a significant difference in the average dNBR and average
   CBI values among the vegetation types was found. Black spruce forests
   overall had the strongest relationship with dNBR, while the high
   severity white spruce forests had the poorest fit with dNBR. Deciduous
   forests and tall shrub plots had the lowest average remotely sensed burn
   severity (dNBR), but not the lowest ground severity among the vegetation
   types sampled. The tundra vegetation sampled had the lowest ground
   severity. Finally, a significant difference was detected between initial
   and extended assessments of dNBR in tundra vegetation types. The results
   indicated that the dNBR can be used as an effective means to map burn

Abstract = {{Forest restoration efforts commonly employ silvicultural methods that
   alter light and competition to influence species composition. Changes to
   forest structure and microclimate may adversely affect some taxa (e.g.,
   terrestrial salamanders), but positively affect others (e.g., early
   successional birds). Salamanders are cited as indicators of ecosystem
   health because of their sensitivity to forest floor micro climate. We
   used drift fences with pitfall and funnel traps in a replicated
   Before-After-Control-Impact design to experimentally assess
   herpetofaunal community response to initial application of three
   silvicultural methods proposed to promote oak regeneration: prescribed
   burning; midstory herbicide; and shelterwood harvests (initial treatment
   of the shelterwood-bum method) and controls, before and for five years
   post-treatment. Species richness of all herpetofauna, amphibians,
   reptiles, frogs, salamanders, or snakes was unaffected by any treatment,
   but lizard species richness increased in the shelterwood harvest.
   Capture rate of total salamanders decreased post-harvest in shelterwood
   units after a 2-3 year delay; Plethodon teyahalee decreased post-harvest
   in shelterwoods, but also in control units. In contrast, capture rate of
   total lizards and Plestiodon fasciatus increased in shelterwood stands

   herbicide treatments did not affect any reptile or amphibian species. A
   marginally lower proportion of juvenile to adult P. teyahalee, and a

Abstract = {{Intensive forest management has been applied in most Fennoscandian
   forests for a period of almost one felling rotation. This paradigm has
   produced even-aged and even-structured forests of different successional
   stages that cover about 90\% of forest land. At the same time, wildfires
   have been nearly eliminated in most of the Fennoscandian nature.
   Consequently, hundreds of species are red-listed because of forest
   management. To support these species, forest management requires
   improvements. Variable retention forestry and habitat restoration have
   been suggested to mitigate negative effects of forest management on
   biodiversity, and these have been practiced to some extent during the
   past few decades. Here, we review experimental results on the effects of
   variable retention and two restoration measures (prescribed burning and
   artificial addition of coarse woody debris) on different species groups
   in Fennoscandia. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Many species
   respond positively to felling within a few years, apparently due to
   released and often ephemeral resources, such as fresh residue and
   stumps. Species associated with shady conditions are negatively
   impacted, but any retention supports many of these, and their species
   composition remains almost unaffected with 50-70\% retention of the
   initial tree volume. (ii) These effects remain detectable for at least
   10- 30 years or, according to some studies, nearly 100 years, e.g., in
   polypore fungi. (iii) Initial effects of prescribed burning on most
   species groups (apart from pyrophiles) are negative, but within 10-15
   years post-fire sites begin to support many rare and threatened
   deadwood-dependent species. Epiphytic lichens, however, remain
   negatively affected. (iv) Artificial addition of deadwood (mostly high
   stumps) supports a wide spectrum of deadwood-dependent species, but the
   species composition differs from that of naturally died trees. (v)
   Moisture and micro-habitat variation are crucial for forest species at
   harvested sites, at least in forests dominated by Norway spruce. We
   conclude that felling method as such is of little importance for
   threatened forest species, although retention mitigates many negative
   effects. These species require microclimatic continuity, and maintenance
   and active increase of legacies, such as deadwood of different qualities
   (species, downed/standing, snag/log/stump, decay stage), very old trees,
   and tree species mixtures.}},
