T1  - Wildfire yields a distinct turnover of the beetle community in a semi-natural pine forest in northern Sweden
AN  - 2436972959
AB  - BackgroundFires have been an important natural disturbance and pervasive evolutionary force in the boreal biome. Yet, fire suppression has made forest fires rare in the managed landscapes in Fennoscandia, causing significant habitat loss for saproxylic species such as polypores and insects. To better understand how the beetle community changes (species turnover) after a wildfire in a landscape with intense fire suppression, we monitored beetles with flight intercept traps the first 3 years as well as 12 years after a large wildfire in a national park in northern Sweden (a control/unburnt area was set up for the last year of sampling).ResultsSpecies composition changed significantly among all studied years with a continuous turnover of species following the wildfire. The indicator species analysis showed that year 1 post-fire was mostly associated with cambium consumers and also the pyrophilous species Batrisodes hubenthali. Year 2 was the most abundant and species-rich year, with Tomicus piniperda as the most important indicator species. The indicator species year 3 were mostly secondary successional species, fungivores, and predators and were characterized by lower species diversity. Year 12 had higher diversity compared with year 3 but lower species richness and abundance. A control area was established during year 12 post-fire, and our analyses showed that the control area and burned area differed in species composition suggesting that the beetle community needs longer than 12 years to recover even after a low-intensive ground fire.ConclusionThe wildfire area hosted several red-listed and fire-dependent species suggesting that after a century of landscape-level fire suppression in a semi-natural area, the reintroduction of fire benefits rare and pyrophilous species and still impacts species composition after 12 years. This study implies that fire has long-lasting effects on high latitudes and that prescribed burning has the potential to benefit biodiversity over decades in these landscapes while also highlighting the value of considering the whole species community and not only monitoring abundance and richness to assess biodiversity after management actions.

T1  - Restoration applications of resource objective wildfires in western US forests: a status of knowledge review
AN  - 2426370710
AB  - BackgroundFrequent-fire forests of the western United States have undergone remarkable changes in structure, composition, and function due to historical exclusion of naturally occurring fire. Mechanized tree thinning to reduce forest density and fuel loads tends to be expensive and cannot be effectively implemented across all lands, and there is increasing interest in managing naturally ignited wildfires for meeting forest restoration objectives. To investigate general effectiveness of resource objective (RO) wildfires for restoring frequent-fire and associated forests of the western United States, we conducted a review of the related peer-reviewed literature.ResultsFormal analysis of ecological responses to RO fires is relatively recent, and 21 of the 37 papers (57%) we reviewed were published between the years 2010 and 2018. We found 17 studies that investigated RO fire outcomes in Sierra Nevada forests, while other ecoregions that were represented in the literature included Arizona–New Mexico Mountains, Middle Rockies–Blue Mountains, and the Colorado Plateau. Yosemite National Park was utilized in 14 of the studies we reviewed. We noted several ecoregions where frequent-fire forests occur, but for which published studies on RO fires are lacking. The main focus of research (14 studies) was related to RO fire effects on forest structure, and next in importance was research (12 studies) related to fire severity, extent, and type, with studies of understory vegetation responses and landscape-scale patterns or dynamics also prevalent. Research findings indicated that RO fires were effective for reducing tree density and fire behavior; however, densities often remained above known historical ranges of variation in several studies. Understory responses reported in the literature were mixed with respect to effects on abundance and species richness. Increases in invasive species abundance in areas of high burn severity were consistently reported. Research on landscape patterns indicated that RO fires can increase heterogeneity with respect to vegetation distribution.ConclusionRO fires can be generally effective for restoration of frequent-fire forests, particularly on landscapes with long histories of fire use and in areas of moderate burn severity. More research is needed to test fire outcomes against specific restoration targets, and additional studies are needed concerning important ecological processes and functions.

T1  - Effect of scots pine forest management on soil properties and carabid beetle occurrence under post-fire environmental conditions - a case study from Central Europe
AN  - 2394757190
AB  - BackgroundFires have a fundamental impact on phytocoenoses and, depending on the size of the fire, can have a positive or negative effect. The role of fires in the formation of the species composition of plants, restoration of stands and changes in soil properties is well studied. However, the long-term relationship between forest management methods, soil properties and epigeic entomofauna assemblages in post-fire areas is still not clear. The effects of Scots pine stand management methods on biochemical soil properties and ground beetle assemblages in the largest post-fire area in Central Europe after the second World were investigated. The study was conducted in the Rudy Raciborskie Forest district in southern Poland. The soil properties and epigeic beetle community structure were analysed. The research covered areas with natural and artificial pine regeneration, which were subjected to various care treatments.ResultsThe tendency for higher accumulations of organic matter in the soil of stands that underwent natural regeneration was proven. The stimulating role of soil organic carbon on the activity of dehydrogenases in the soil of naturally renewed areas with silvicultural treatment (NRAT) was noted. Regardless of the manner of stand regeneration, the activity of β-glucosidase was higher in the areas in which breeding treatments were practised. Furthermore, managed forest stands presented a higher abundance of carabid beetles than stands without treatment practices. Thirteen epigeic beetle species from the families Geotrupidae, Carabidae, Curculionidae, Cerambycidae and Silphidae were captured, with beetles from the first two families being the most numerous. Rare epigeal carabid species in the fauna of Poland and Europe, such as Carabus glabratus (Paykull) and Carabus auronitens Fabr., found appropriate habitat conditions for survival in the post-fire areas. Compared with the other areas, in the NRAT area, there were better stand and soil properties and more features conducive to epigeic entomofaunal occurrences. The highest post-fire content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was recorded in the soils of the sites that underwent artificial regeneration. The results suggest that preparing the soil before the introduction of new vegetation affects the amount of aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).ConclusionsThe better performance of the NRAT stand draws attention to the positive aspects of the use of natural regeneration, both from ecological and economic perspectives. The effects of forest management on the amount of soil organic matter after fires have been proven. The natural regeneration of stands was conducive to the accumulation of organic matter. The enzymatic activity of soils is influenced by the renewal method and forest management strategy. The NRAT area was characterized by the highest number of carabid species.

T1  - Experimental evidence on biodiversity impacts of variable retention forestry, prescribed burning, and deadwood manipulation in Fennoscandia
AN  - 2352070304
AB  - Intensive forest management has been applied in most Fennoscandian forests for a period of almost one felling rotation. This paradigm has produced even-aged and even-structured forests of different successional stages that cover about 90% of forest land. At the same time, wildfires have been nearly eliminated in most of the Fennoscandian nature. Consequently, hundreds of species are red-listed because of forest management. To support these species, forest management requires improvements. Variable retention forestry and habitat restoration have been suggested to mitigate negative effects of forest management on biodiversity, and these have been practiced to some extent during the past few decades. Here, we review experimental results on the effects of variable retention and two restoration measures (prescribed burning and artificial addition of coarse woody debris) on different species groups in Fennoscandia. Our key findings are as follows: (i) Many species respond positively to felling within a few years, apparently due to released and often ephemeral resources, such as fresh residue and stumps. Species associated with shady conditions are negatively impacted, but any retention supports many of these, and their species composition remains almost unaffected with 50–70% retention of the initial tree volume. (ii) These effects remain detectable for at least 10–30 years or, according to some studies, nearly 100 years, e.g., in polypore fungi. (iii) Initial effects of prescribed burning on most species groups (apart from pyrophiles) are negative, but within 10–15 years post-fire sites begin to support many rare and threatened deadwood-dependent species. Epiphytic lichens, however, remain negatively affected. (iv) Artificial addition of deadwood (mostly high stumps) supports a wide spectrum of deadwood-dependent species, but the species composition differs from that of naturally died trees. (v) Moisture and micro-habitat variation are crucial for forest species at harvested sites, at least in forests dominated by Norway spruce. We conclude that felling method as such is of little importance for threatened forest species, although retention mitigates many negative effects. These species require microclimatic continuity, and maintenance and active increase of legacies, such as deadwood of different qualities (species, downed/standing, snag/log/stump, decay stage), very old trees, and tree species mixtures.

T1  - Herbicide Protection Pods (HPPs) Facilitate Sagebrush and Bunchgrass Establishment under Imazapic Control of Exotic Annual Grasses
AN  - 2437392625
AB  - Revegetation of exotic annual grass−invaded rangelands is a primary objective of land managers following wildfires. Controlling invasive annual grasses is essential to increasing revegetation success; however, preemergent herbicides used to control annual grasses prohibit immediate seeding due to nontarget herbicide damage. Thus, seeding is often delayed 1 yr following herbicide application. This delay frequently allows for reinvasion of annual grasses, decreasing the success of revegetation efforts. Incorporating seeds into herbicide protection pods (HPPs) containing activated carbon (AC) permits concurrent high preemergent herbicide application and seeding because AC adsorbs and renders herbicides inactive. While HPPs have, largely in greenhouse studies, facilitated perennial bunchgrass emergence and early growth, their effectiveness in improving establishment of multiple species and functional groups in the field has not been assessed. Five bunchgrass species and two shrub species were seeded at two field sites with high imazapic application rates as bare seed and seed incorporated into HPPs. HPPs significantly improved establishment of sagebrush (Artemesia tridentata Nutt. Spp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertn.) over the 2-yr study. Three native perennial grass species were protected from herbicide damage by HPPs but had low establishment in both treatments. The two remaining shrub and grass species did not establish sufficiently to determine treatment effects. While establishment of native perennial bunchgrasses was low, this study demonstrates that HPPs can be used to protect seeded bunchgrasses and sagebrush from imazapic, prolonging establishment time in the absence of competition with annual grasses.

T1  - Response of Planted Sagebrush Seedlings to Cattle Grazing Applied to Decrease Fire Probability
AN  - 2437392179
AB  - Restoration of non-sprouting shrubs after wildfire is increasingly becoming a management priority. In the western U.S., Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) restoration is a high priority, but sagebrush establishment from seed is sporadic. In contrast, planting seedlings often successfully restores sagebrush, but is expensive and time consuming. After planting, hence, there is a need to protect the investment from disturbances such as fire that will erase gains in sagebrush recovery. Grazing is likely the only tool that can be applied feasibly across the landscape to decrease wildfire probability, but there are concerns that grazing and associated activities (e.g. trampling) may negatively impact sagebrush seedlings. We investigated effects of grazing by cattle, applied as a fine fuel management strategy, on planted sagebrush seedlings at five blocks for five years. Grazing substantial reduced exotic annual grasses, large perennial bunchgrasses, and total herbaceous cover, thus achieving fuel management goals. Sagebrush cover and reproductive efforts were almost 2-fold greater in grazed compared to non-grazed areas in the final year of the study. This suggests that grazing favored sagebrush, a generally unpalatable shrub, recovery, likely by reducing competition from highly palatable herbaceous vegetation. Density of sagebrush, however, was similar between grazed and non-grazed areas. This research demonstrates that grazing can be strategically applied to reduce the probability of wildfire in areas with planted sagebrush seedlings; thereby, protecting the investment in sagebrush recovery. With more refinement, it also appears that grazing can be utilized to accelerate the recovery of sagebrush and potentially other woody vegetation habitat by modifying the competitive relationship between herbaceous and woody vegetation.

T1  - Status of mammals on Groote Eylandt: Safe haven or slow burn?
AN  - 2435534851
AB  - Native mammals across northern Australia have suffered severe decline, with feral cats (Felis catus), introduced herbivores and changed fire regimes being implicated as drivers. However, uncertainty surrounding the relative contribution of each of these threats, and the interactions between them, is limiting the development of effective management strategies. The absence of introduced herbivores and cane toads (Rhinella marina) on Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, provides an opportunity to evaluate some hypothesised threats in isolation of others. We used camera traps to investigate the correlates of native mammal distribution and abundance at 112 lowland savanna sites across Groote Eylandt. Two large grids of camera traps were also deployed to obtain estimates of feral cat density. We hypothesised that native mammal populations would be negatively associated with feral cat occupancy as well as frequent, large fires. Native mammal site‐occupancy on Groote Eylandt was generally higher compared to mainland Northern Territory. Feral cats were infrequently detected, precluding both an estimate of feral cat density and an evaluation of the relationship between feral cats and native mammals. We found no evidence that native mammal site‐occupancy or relative abundance is negatively associated with frequent, large fires. The relatively healthy state of native mammal populations on Groote Eylandt is likely due to the low density of feral cats, the benign fire regime and the absence of large introduced herbivores and cane toads. However, due to a lack of historical data, the current state of mammals should not be taken as evidence that these populations are safe from decline. This study highlights that the apparent resilience of mammal populations is a result of complex interactions between factors that vary substantially across the landscape. Caution is therefore required when making broad inferences about the drivers of mammal decline from studies that are spatially and temporally limited.

T1  - Initial Effects of Wildfire on Freshwater Turtle Nesting Habitat
AN  - 2434350984
AB  - Natural wildfire regimes are important for ecosystem succession but can have negative ecological effects depending on fire characteristics. A portion of a granite rock barrens landscape that extends along the eastern shoreline of Georgian Bay, Lake Huron to eastern Ontario, Canada, burned in 2018 during a wildfire that affected >11,000 ha. This landscape is a biodiversity hotspot providing habitat for many species at risk where freshwater turtles nest in soil deposits in cracks and crevices in the bedrock dominated by moss (Polytrichum spp.) and lichen (Cladonia spp.) cover. To assess the initial effect of wildfire on freshwater turtle nesting habitat, we measured soil depths and estimated moss, lichen, and vascular plant cover at 2 morphology types (crevice, flat) in burned and unburned areas of the landscape. The probability that burned flat plots supported soil was near zero; the burned flat plots had 98% less soil volume compared to unburned flat plots. Although crevices were more resistant to soil loss, burned crevices still had a 15% lower probability of having soil and 35% less soil volume compared to unburned crevice plots. We estimated nest site availability by calculating the number of locations with shallow (5–10 cm), intermediate (10–20 cm), and deep (>20 cm) soils required for a small (5 cm × 5 cm) or medium (10 cm × 10 cm) nest chamber. Overall, the burned open rock barrens had 71–73% fewer sites with suitable soil depth and volume for a nest chamber of either size. Furthermore, burned plots had almost no lichen and moss cover but were dominated by bare soil, forbs, and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) seedlings. Although the loss of tree cover in previously forested areas may increase nest site availability for freshwater turtles in newly open areas, we suggest that organic soil combustion and soil erosion may require restoration activities in the post‐fire landscape to support successful nesting of at‐risk turtles. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Northern Bobwhite Non‐Breeding Habitat Selection in a Longleaf Pine Woodland
AN  - 2434342624
AB  - Efforts to halt the decline of the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite) across its distribution have had limited success. Understanding bobwhite habitat requirements across the annual cycle and at varying scales is essential to aid efforts to conserve bobwhites. We monitored radio‐tagged bobwhites from 2016 to 2018 on a 165‐km2 portion of Fort Bragg Military Installation in the Sandhills physiographic region of North Carolina, USA, to determine factors influencing non‐breeding bobwhite habitat selection at multiple scales. We used generalized linear models (GLM) and generalized linear mixed models to assess bobwhite habitat selection at the microsite scale (the immediate vicinity of an animal) and the macrosite scale (across the study area), respectively, by comparing used points to available random points. At the microsite scale, bobwhites strongly selected areas with greater woody understory cover. Also, bobwhite selection increased with greater forb and switchcane (Arundinaria tecta) cover, but this effect plateaued at 65% forb cover and 50% switchcane cover. At the macrosite scale, bobwhites generally selected areas with greater understory cover within a 200‐m radius but avoided areas with >55% understory cover; these areas primarily were located in the core areas of drainages with extensive ericaceous vegetation. Bobwhites selected areas with 3–6 m2/ha hardwood basal area in uplands, potentially because of the availability of mast, but avoided uplands when pine (Pinus spp.) or hardwood basal area exceeded 20 m2/ha or 12 m2/ha, respectively, likely because high basal area is associated with increased shading and subsequent loss of understory cover. In addition, bobwhites selected uplands 1 growing season (≥2‐month period falling entirely between 1 Apr and 1 Oct) post‐fire regardless of burn season. Overall, managers seeking to improve habitat quality for bobwhites in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) woodlands should employ management practices that maintain available woody understory across the landscape to provide cover during the non‐breeding season. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Projected Climate-Fire Interactions Drive Forest to Shrubland Transition on an Arizona Sky Island
AN  - 2435936946
AB  - Climate stressors on forests of the American Southwest are shifting species distributions across spatial scales, lengthening potential fire seasons, and increasing the incidence of drought and insect-related die-off. A legacy of fire exclusion in forests once adapted to frequent surface fires is exacerbating these changes. Reducing stand densities and surface fuel loads has been proposed as a means of moderating fire behavior while reducing competition for water, but it is not established whether thinning treatments and restoration of surface fire regimes will be enough to offset the multiple manifestations of a changing climate. We examined the potential for prescribed fuel treatments and restoration of historical fire frequencies to mitigate the effects of climate on forest species distributions, composition, total biomass, and fire severity. We used an ecosystem process model to simulate the effects of projected climate, fire, and active management interactions along an ecological gradient of shrublands, woodlands, and forests on a mountain range in Arizona, USA. We used historical climate conditions as a baseline to compare results from projected climate, for the period 2005-2055, with and without fire, and with no fuel treatments, a single-entry fuel treatment, and a second fuel treatment after twenty years. Simulated desert grassland and shrub communities remained compositionally stable and maintained or expanded their extents, while woodland and forest communities lost basal area and total biomass and receded to the coolest and wettest aspects and drainages, even without fire. Initial fuel treatments reduced the extent and relative mortality of high-severity patches for the first two decades and secondary treatments at simulation year 20 extended these effects for the remaining 30-years of simulation. Immediate and future fuel treatments showed potential to mitigate the severity of fire effects under projected conditions and slow the transition from forest to shrubland in some vegetation types; however, a reduction in basal area and spatial extent of some forest species occurred regardless of management actions. Results are being used to inform local land managers and partners of potential landscape changes resulting from climate alone, from climate-fire interactions, and to coordinate active management of fuels across ownerships.

T1  - Improving restoration success through microsite selection: an example with planting sagebrush seedlings after wildfire
AN  - 2428401459
AB  - Post‐fire restoration of foundation plant species, particularly non‐sprouting shrubs, is critically needed in arid and semi‐arid rangeland, but is hampered by low success. Expensive and labor‐intensive methods, including planting seedlings, can improve restoration success. Prioritizing where these more intensive methods are applied may improve restoration efficiency. Shrubs in arid and semi‐arid environments can create resource islands under their canopies that may remain after fire. Seedlings planted post‐fire in former canopy and between canopies (interspace) may have different survival and growth. We compared planting Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) seedlings post‐fire in former sagebrush canopy and interspace microsites at five locations. Four growing seasons after planting, seedling survival was 46 and 7% in canopy and interspace microsites, respectively. Sagebrush cover was 5.8 times greater in canopy compared to interspace microsites. Sagebrush survival and cover were likely greater because of less competition from herbaceous vegetation as well as benefiting from resource island effects in canopy microsites. Initially, post‐fire abundance of exotic annual grasses was less in canopy microsites, but by the third year post‐fire it was substantially greater in canopy microsites, indicating that resource availability to seedlings was greater, at least initially, in canopy microsites. These results suggest microsites with greater likelihood of success should be identified and then utilized to improve restoration success and efficiency. This is important as the need for restoration greatly exceeds resources available for restoration.

T1  - Changes in soil fungal communities following anthropogenic disturbance are linked to decreased lodgepole pine seedling performance
AN  - 2419285349
AB  - Disturbances are frequent events across the Canadian boreal forest and can affect both below‐ and above‐ground ecosystem processes. How disturbances change below‐ground soil fungal communities and in‐turn affect pine establishment and performance is poorly understood. Such understanding has become increasingly important in light of observed changes in disturbance regimes in recent years due to climate change.We used a greenhouse experiment to determine how soil inoculum collected from lodgepole pine stands undisturbed (control) or disturbed by fire, mountain pine beetle outbreak, logging and salvage logging affect pine seedling performance in western Canada. We first characterized whether fungal communities of seedling roots change as a function of inoculum source, and then determined whether changes in fungal community composition impact pine seedling performance (biomass and height).Root fungal communities of pine seedlings from logged and salvage logged disturbances differed from their respective paired controls, while soils from natural disturbances (fire and beetle outbreak) did not. Among disturbances, the pine root fungal communities of fire and salvage logged disturbances differed.In parallel to the root fungal communities, seedling performance also decreased when comparing logging and salvage logging disturbances to paired controls. Among disturbance treatments, seedlings from the salvage logged disturbance did not grow as big as seedlings inoculated with soils from burned forests.Synthesis and application. Our findings indicate that anthropogenic disturbances (logging and salvage logging) can have cross‐generational impacts on pine seedling performance, through functional shifts in seedling root fungal community structure. Furthermore, the impacts of soil fungi on pine seedlings appear to be pronounced following salvage logging, stressing the importance of compound disturbance events. These findings may be important to land managers considering clear‐cut logging or salvage logging in pine forests, particularly where soil biotic communities are likely to be one of the predominate factors in pine establishment.

T1  - Habitat structural complexity explains patterns of feral cat and dingo occurrence in monsoonal Australia
AN  - 2417960905
AB  - AimAn interaction between reduced habitat structural complexity and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) has been hypothesized as the primary driver of mammal decline in northern Australia. However, we have a limited understanding of the drivers of the distribution and abundance of feral cats at a landscape scale, including whether the occurrence of a top predator, the dingo (Canis familiaris [dingo]), limits feral cat populations. We modelled feral cat and dingo site occurrence, to provide the first broad‐scale assessment of their distributional patterns and co‐occurrence within monsoonal Australia.LocationAbout 370,000 km2 of monsoonal area in the Northern Territory.MethodsWe surveyed 376 sites using camera traps. We used single‐ and two‐species occupancy models to investigate feral cat and dingo site occurrence and the influence of dingoes on feral cat occupancy. We included predictor variables that relate to hypotheses of predator occurrence, including both environmental and disturbance‐related variables.ResultsFeral cat occurrence and dingo occurrence were best predicted by indices of habitat structural complexity; feral cat occurrence declined with increasing productivity, except in areas of relatively high fire activity (fire frequency and extent), and dingo occurrence declined with terrain ruggedness. We found no evidence that dingoes are spatially limiting feral cat occurrence.Main conclusionsOur findings suggest the protection and enhancement of habitat structural complexity at both the local and landscape scale could enable conservation managers to reduce the exposure of small‐ and medium‐sized mammals to feral cats and dingoes. This can most likely be achieved through improved fire and feral herbivore management, which is a more feasible management option than lethal predator control.

T1  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of habitat availability and stability for a critically endangered arboreal marsupial: implications for conservation planning in a fire-prone landscape
AN  - 2417699949
AB  - ContextEffective conservation planning for species depends on vegetation models that can capture the dynamics of habitat elements across both spatial and temporal domains. Incorporating these dynamics at landscape scales is essential for understanding the impact of natural disturbance, management, and climate change on habitat availability and stability on fauna.ObjectivesTo explore the impact of resource availability, wildfire, forest management (timber harvesting and planned burning), and climate change on the habitat of the critically endangered Leadbeater’s possum (LBP; Gymnobelideus leadbeateri McCoy) with the goal of understanding the importance of these factors on future habitat availability.MethodsWe used a spatially explicit landscape-simulation model, LANDIS-II, linked to habitat suitability and patch modelling, to identify quantity, configuration, and temporal stability of habitat for LBP. We used boosted regression trees and general additive modelling to explore the importance of management and disturbance factors on future LBP habitat availability.ResultsWildfire was the main factor determining all habitat components for LBP, both alone and in interaction with climate change and forest management. We identified stable habitat patches that will likely persist under future conditions, and that might be prioritised for conservation in a dynamic landscape.ConclusionsWe highlight how the current reserve network could be augmented to improve the future conservation status of LBP. Our approach provides conservation planners with a spatially and temporally explicit framework for incorporating the key dynamic processes that are typically omitted in conservation planning.

T1  - Patch-Burning Buffers Forage Resources and Livestock Performance to Mitigate Drought in the Northern Great Plains
AN  - 2417354377
AB  - Summer droughts in North America's northern Great Plains are expected to increase in frequency and duration as precipitation shifts toward spring and fall. Two rangeland experimental stations in North Dakota experienced drought in 2017 relative to 25-year averages. The southwest location had a 170-mm deficit from the 360-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle (Bos taurus L.) and sheep (Ovis aries L.); the south-central location had 109 mm below the 403-mm normal rainfall and was grazed by cattle. We evaluated patch-burn grazing as a drought resilient land management strategy in the northern Great Plains by comparing average daily gains, fecal density, available forage biomass, and forage crude protein content. At the southwest location, livestock performed better during the drought season compared with animals on the same pastures in the previous year, which had near-normal rainfall but no fire. At the central location, cows on patch-burned pastures performed better than cows on continuously-grazed, unburned pastures in the same year under drought conditions; all cows were nursing calves and calf gains did not vary between treatments. In both locations, the burned patches had higher fecal density and lower available forage biomass than patches not yet burned throughout the grazing season, indicating grazer attraction to burned areas. Despite drought, burned patches maintained grazer attraction and animal performance was maintained or even improved, which contrasts with the expected relationship between animal performance and precipitation. This study indicated that prescribed patch-burning might mitigate drought by buffering forage resources (crude protein content and availability) and maintaining animal performance (average daily gains).

T1  - Effects of pyric herbivory on prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus spp) habitat
AN  - 2416236569
AB  - The reduction and simplification of grasslands has led to the decline of numerous species of grassland fauna, particularly grassland-obligate birds. Prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus spp.) are an example of obligate grassland birds that have declined throughout most of their distribution and are species of conservation concern. Pyric herbivory has been suggested as a land management strategy for enhancing prairie-chicken habitat and stabilizing declining population trends. We assessed differences in vegetation structure created by pyric herbivory compared to fire-only treatments to determine whether pyric herbivory increased habitat heterogeneity for prairie-chickens, spatially or temporally. Our study was performed at four sites in the southern Great Plains, all within the current or historic distribution of either lesser (T. pallidicinctus), greater (T. cupido), or Attwater’s (T. cupido attwateri) prairie-chickens. Key vegetation characteristics of grass cover and vegetation height in pyric herbivory and fire-only treatments were within the recommended range of values for prairie-chickens during their distinct life history stages. However, patches managed via pyric herbivory provided approximately 5% more forb cover than fire-only treatments for almost 30 months post-fire. Additionally, pyric herbivory extended the length of time bare ground was present after fires. Pyric herbivory also reduced vegetation height and biomass, with mean vegetation height in pyric herbivory treatments lagging behind fire-only treatments by approximately 15 months. Canopy cover in fire-only treatments exceeded levels recommended for prairie-chicken young within 12 months post-fire. However, canopy cover in pyric herbivory treatments never exceeded the maximum recommended levels. Overall, it appears that pyric herbivory improves vegetation characteristics reported as critical to prairie-chicken reproduction. Based on our results, we suggest pyric herbivory as a viable management technique to promote prairie-chicken habitat in the southern Great Plains, while still accommodating livestock production.

T1  - Salvage logging changes the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional successional trajectories of forest bird communities
AN  - 2409206376
AB  - Salvage logging following natural disturbances may alter the natural successional trajectories of biological communities by affecting the occurrences of species, functional groups and evolutionary lineages. However, few studies have examined whether dissimilarities between bird communities of salvaged and unsalvaged forests are more pronounced for rare species, functional groups and evolutionary lineages than for their more common counterparts.We compiled data on breeding bird assemblages from nine study areas in North America, Europe and Asia, covering a 17‐year period following wildfire or windstorm disturbances and subsequent salvage logging. We tested whether dissimilarities based on non‐shared species, functional groups and evolutionary lineages (a) decreased or increased over time and (b) the responses of rare, common and dominant species varied, by using a unified statistical framework based on Hill numbers and null models.We found that dissimilarities between bird communities caused by salvage logging persisted over time for rare, common and dominant species, evolutionary lineages and for rare functional groups. Dissimilarities of common and dominant functional groups increased 14 years post disturbance.Salvage logging led to significantly larger dissimilarities than expected by chance. Functional dissimilarities between salvaged and unsalvaged sites were lower compared to taxonomic and phylogenetic dissimilarities. In general, dissimilarities were highest for rare, followed by common and dominant species.Synthesis and applications. Our research demonstrates that salvage logging did not decrease dissimilarities of bird communities over time and taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dissimilarities persisted for over a decade. We recommend resource managers and decision makers to reserve portions of disturbed forest to enable unmanaged post‐disturbance succession of bird communities, particularly to conserve rare species found in unsalvaged disturbed forests.

T1  - Integrating functional connectivity and fire management for better conservation outcomes
AN  - 2406343831
AB  - Globally, the mean abundance of terrestrial animals has fallen by 50% since 1970, and populations face ongoing threats associated with habitat loss, fragmentation, climate change, and disturbance. Climate change can influence the quality of remaining habitat directly and indirectly by precipitating increases in the extent, frequency, and severity of natural disturbances, such as fire. Species face the combined threats of habitat clearance, changing climates, and altered disturbance regimes, each of which may interact and have cascading impacts on animal populations. Typically, conservation agencies are limited in their capacity to mitigate rates of habitat clearance, habitat fragmentation, or climate change, yet fire management is increasingly used worldwide to reduce wildfire risk and achieve conservation outcomes. A popular approach to ecological fire management involves the creation of fire mosaics to promote animal diversity. However, this strategy has 2 fundamental limitations: the effect of fire on animal movement within or among habitat patches is not considered and the implications of the current fire regime for long‐term population persistence are overlooked. Spatial and temporal patterns in fire history can influence animal movement, which is essential to the survival of individual animals, maintenance of genetic diversity, and persistence of populations, species, and ecosystems. We argue that there is rich potential for fire managers to manipulate animal movement patterns; enhance functional connectivity, gene flow, and genetic diversity; and increase the capacity of populations to persist under shifting environmental conditions. Recent methodological advances, such as spatiotemporal connectivity modeling, spatially explicit individual‐based simulation, and fire‐regime modeling can be integrated to achieve better outcomes for biodiversity in human‐modified, fire‐prone landscapes.Article impact statement: Land managers may conserve populations by using fire to sustain or enhance functional connectivity.Alternate abstract:Integración de la Conectividad Funcional y el Manejo de Incendios para Mejores Resultados de ConservaciónLa abundancia media de animales terrestres ha disminuido en un 50% desde 1970 en todo el mundo y las poblaciones de animales enfrentan amenazas continuas asociadas con la pérdida del hábitat, la fragmentación, el cambio climático y la perturbación. El cambio climático puede influir directa e indirectamente sobre la calidad de los hábitats permanecientes al precipitar incrementos en la extensión, frecuencia y severidad de la perturbación natural, como por ejemplo los incendios. Las especies enfrentan las amenazas combinadas de la modificación de hábitats, climas cambiantes y regímenes alterados de perturbación, cada uno de los cuales puede interactuar con los otros y tener impactos en cascada sobre las poblaciones animales. Habitualmente, las agencias de conservación tienen capacidades limitadas para mitigar las tasas de alteración de hábitats, fragmentación del hábitat o cambio climático. A pesar de esto, el manejo de incendios cada vez se usa más a nivel mundial para reducir el riesgo de incendios forestales y para producir resultados de conservación. Una estrategia popular para el manejo de incendios ecológicos involucra la creación de mosaicos de incendios para promover la diversidad de animales. Sin embargo, esta estrategia tiene dos limitaciones fundamentales: no considera el efecto del fuego sobre el movimiento de los animales dentro o entre los fragmentos de hábitat y pasa por alto las implicaciones del régimen actual de incendios para la persistencia a largo plazo de la población. Los patrones espaciales y temporales en la historia de los incendios pueden influir sobre el movimiento animal, lo cual es esencial para la supervivencia de los animales individuales, el mantenimiento de la diversidad genética y la persistencia de las poblaciones, especies y ecosistemas. Argumentamos que existe un amplio potencial para que los manejadores de incendios manipulen los patrones de movimiento de los animales; mejoren la conectividad funcional, el flujo génico y la diversidad genética; e incrementen la capacidad de las poblaciones de persistir bajo condiciones ambientales cambiantes. Los avances metodológicos recientes, como el modelado de la conectividad espaciotemporal, la simulación espacial basada en individuos y el modelado de regímenes de incendios, pueden integrarse para obtener mejores resultados para la biodiversidad en paisajes propensos a incendios y modificados por el humano.Alternate abstract:自1970 年以来, 全球陆生动物的平均丰度已下降 50%, 且陆生动物种群正面临着栖息地丧失及破碎化、气候变化和干扰等因素引起的持续威胁。气候变化可能导致自然干扰 (如火灾) 范围扩大、频率增加和严重程度加剧, 从而直接或间接地影响现存栖息地的质量。而物种则面临着栖息地消失、气候变化和干扰状况变化的共同威胁, 且每种威胁因素都可能相互作用并对动物种群产生级联影响。通常情况下, 保护机构在减缓栖息地丧失、栖息地破碎化或气候变化影响的方面能力有限, 但全球范围内已有越来越多保护机构在利用林火管理来降低野火风险并达到保护成效。生态林火管理的常用方法包括在镶嵌斑块中制造林火以提高动物的多样性。然而, 这一策略有两个基本的局限性:一是没有考虑火灾对栖息地斑块内或斑块间动物运动的影响, 同时忽视了火情对动物种群长期续存的影响。林火历史的时空模式可以影响动物的运动, 这对动物的个体存活、遗传多样性维持以及种群、物种和生态系统的续存都至关重要。我们认为林火管理者有很大潜力来操控动物的运动模式, 提高功能连接度、基因流和遗传多样性, 提高种群在不断变化的环境条件下续存的能力。近年来方法上的进展, 如时空连接度建模、基于个体的空间显式模拟和火情建模等, 都可以整合在一起, 从而更好地保护人类主导、有火灾风险的景观中的生物多样性。【翻译: 胡怡思; 审校: 聂永刚】

T1  - Diversity loss and changes in saproxylic beetle assemblages following a high-severity fire in <i>Araucaria–Nothofagus</i> forests
AN  - 2400058315
AB  - Forest fires have increased in frequency worldwide due to global warming, drought, and land-use change. These fire-regime changes have altered the dynamics of deadwood accumulation in forests, which can affect biological communities dependent on this resource. We analyzed the effect of high-severity fire events on saproxylic beetle assemblages, which specialize in using deadwood that accumulates after disturbances. We compared assemblages in sites severely burned in 2002 to those in unburned sites in Chilean Araucaria–Nothofagus forests. Insects were collected using window-interception traps from spring 2017 to summer 2018. Rarefaction–interpolation curves revealed a significant decrease in diversity as a result of fire. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant effect of fire on insect community structure. In addition, we observed that species turnover contributing most, and nestedness to a lesser extent, to differences in ß-diversity between burned and unburned sites. Species replacement was associated with an increase in abundance of xylophagous (deadwood feeders) and a decrease in abundance of mycophagous (fungivorous) insects with fire. Therefore, our results suggest that fire causes a reduction in diversity while benefiting the abundance of xylophagous beetles in Araucaria–Nothofagus forests. We recommend the use of these insects as an evaluation tool in conservation planning, management practices, and ecological restoration efforts in burned forests in southern Chile.

T1  - Quantifying Pinyon-Juniper Reduction within North America's Sagebrush Ecosystem
AN  - 2425699664
AB  - One of the primary conservation threats surrounding sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems in the Intermountain West of the United States is the expansion and infilling of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis, P. monophylla) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands. Woodland expansion into sagebrush ecosystems has demonstrated impacts on sagebrush-associated flora and fauna, particularly the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). These impacts have prompted government agencies, land managers, and landowners to ramp up pinyon-juniper removal efforts to maintain and restore sagebrush ecosystems. Accurately quantifying and analyzing management activities over time across broad spatial extents still poses a major challenge. Such information is vital to broad-scale planning and coordination of management efforts. To address this problem and aid future management planning, we applied a remote sensing change detection approach to map reductions in pinyon-juniper cover across the sage-grouse range and developed a method for rapidly updating maps of canopy cover. We found total conifer reduction over the past several yr (2011−2013 to 2015−2017) amounted to 1.6% of the area supporting tree cover within our study area, which is likely just keeping pace with estimates of expansion. Two-thirds of conifer reduction was attributed to active management (1.04% of the treed area) while wildfire accounted for one-third of all estimated conifer reduction in the region (0.56% of the treed area). Our results also illustrate the breadth of this management effort—crossing ownership, agency, and state boundaries. We conclude by identifying some key priorities that should be considered in future conifer management efforts based on our comprehensive assessment.

T1  - Short‐term response of threatened small macropods and their predators to prescribed burns in subtropical Australia
AN  - 2407217861
AB  - Fire is an important ecological process that shapes vegetation structure and habitat for faunal assemblages globally. Prescribed burns are increasingly being used in conservation and management to restore fire regimes in fire‐suppressed vegetation communities. Small threatened macropods require structurally complex habitat that allows them to evade detection by predators. Given that fire can alter vegetation structure, it can be viewed as a strong ecological force in shifting the dynamics between predator and prey species. Previous studies in temperate Australia have shown that prescribed burns in the presence of European Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral Cat (Felis catus) can have negative impacts on small macropods and medium‐sized mammals. Post‐fire response of threatened small macropods and their predators has not been experimentally examined in subtropical Australia despite this region providing refugia for the Long‐nosed Potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and Red‐legged Pademelon (Thylogale stigmatica). We conducted a before‐after‐control‐impact fire experiment at two paired sites after low–moderate intensity burns typical of cool season prescribed burns. We used camera trapping to investigate changes in activity of threatened small macropods and their predators. We also recorded vegetation change. Despite large reductions in ground and shrub cover, activity of small macropods and the Dingo (Canis dingo) did not change in response to fires. Therefore, the threat of dingo predation appears to have remained unchanged following the fires. Although feral cats and foxes were present, they showed negligible activity across our sites. Our study suggests that small‐scale patchy ecological burns may not lead to increased predation of small macropods in our landscape. We attribute this to sufficient post‐fire refugia and very low densities of foxes.

T1  - Development and evaluation of habitat suitability models for nesting white-headed woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus) in burned forest
AN  - 2403302136
AB  - Salvage logging in burned forests can negatively affect habitat for white-headed woodpeckers (Dryobates albolarvatus), a species of conservation concern, but also meets socioeconomic demands for timber and human safety. Habitat suitability index (HSI) models can inform forest management activities to help meet habitat conservation objectives. Informing post-fire forest management, however, involves model application at new locations as wildfires occur, requiring evaluation of predictive performance across locations. We developed HSI models for white-headed woodpeckers using nest sites from two burned-forest locations in Oregon, the Toolbox (2002) and Canyon Creek (2015) fires. We measured predictive performance by developing one model at each of the two locations and quantifying discrimination of nest from reference sites at two other wildfire locations where the model had not been developed (either Toolbox or Canyon Creek, and the Barry Point Fire [2011]). We developed and evaluated Maxent models based on remotely sensed environmental metrics to support habitat mapping, and weighted logistic regression (WLR) models that combined remotely sensed and field-collected metrics to inform management prescriptions. Both Maxent and WLR models developed either at Canyon Creek or Toolbox performed adequately to inform management when applied at the alternate Toolbox or Canyon Creek location, respectively (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC] range = 0.61–0.72) but poorly when applied at Barry Point (AUC = 0.53–0.57). The final HSI models fitted to Toolbox and Canyon Creek data quantified suitable nesting habitat as severely burned or open sites adjacent to lower severity and closed canopy sites, where foraging presumably occurs. We suggest these models are applicable at locations similar to development locations but not at locations resembling Barry Point, which were characterized by more (pre-fire) canopy openings, larger diameter trees, less ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and more juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Considering our results, we recommend caution when applying HSI models developed at individual wildfire locations to inform post-fire management at new locations without first evaluating predictive performance.

T1  - Harmony on the prairie? Grassland plant and animal community responses to variation in climate across land‐use gradients
AN  - 2396715346
AB  - Human induced climate and land‐use change are severely impacting global biodiversity, but how community composition and richness of multiple taxonomic groups change in response to local drivers and whether these responses are synchronous remains unclear. We used long‐term community‐level data from an experimentally manipulated grassland to assess the relative influence of climate and land use as drivers of community structure of four taxonomic groups: birds, mammals, grasshoppers, and plants. We also quantified the synchrony of responses among taxonomic groups across land‐use gradients and compared climatic drivers of community structure across groups. All four taxonomic groups responded strongly to land use (fire frequency and grazing), while responses to climate variability were more pronounced in grasshoppers and small mammals. Animal groups exhibited asynchronous responses across all land‐use treatments, but plant and animal groups, especially birds, exhibited synchronous responses in composition. Asynchrony was attributed to taxonomic groups responding to different components of climate variability, including both current climate conditions and lagged effects from the previous year. Data‐driven land management strategies are crucial for sustaining native biodiversity in grassland systems, but asynchronous responses of taxonomic groups to climate variability across land‐use gradients highlight a need to incorporate response heterogeneity into management planning.

T1  - Predators, fire or resources: What drives the distribution of herbivores in fragmented mesic forests?
AN  - 2389678615
AB  - Trophic interactions and disturbance events can shape the structure and function of ecosystems. However, the effects of drivers such as predation, fire and climatic variables on species distributions are rarely considered concurrently. We used a replicated landscape‐scale predator management experiment to compare the effects of red fox Vulpes vulpes control, time‐since‐fire, vegetation type and other environmental variables on native herbivore distributions. Occurrence data for four native herbivores and an invasive predator – the red fox – were collected from 240 sites across three baited (for lethal fox control) and three unbaited forest blocks (4659–9750 ha) in south‐western Victoria, Australia, and used to build species distribution models. The herbivore taxa were as follows: red‐necked wallaby Macropus rufogriseus, black wallaby Wallabia bicolour, grey kangaroo Macropus fuligenosus and Macropus giganteus and common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula. Fox control and fire had little effect on herbivore occurrence, despite the literature suggesting it can influence abundance, while climate, proximity to farmland and topography were more influential. This may be because the region’s high productivity and agricultural pastures subsidise food resources for both predators and prey within the forest blocks and so dampen trophic interactions. Alternatively, these drivers may affect herbivore abundance, but not herbivore occurrence. Understanding the drivers of herbivore distributions is an important step in predicting the effects of herbivory on other species, particularly after management interventions such as predator control and prescribed burns.

T1  - Caribou in the cross-fire? Considering terrestrial lichen forage in the face of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) expansion
AN  - 2396928470
AB  - Mountain pine beetle (MPB) has become an invasive forest pest of mature pine in western North America as it spreads beyond its former endemic range. Management actions such as timber harvest can reduce the spread of MPB but may affect species of conservation concern like woodland caribou. Our goal was to inform MPB management within caribou ranges by exploring the impacts of MPB on caribou habitat–focusing on terrestrial lichens, an important winter food for caribou. We evaluated differences in lichen cover among four MPB management actions: timber harvest, wildfires, leaving MPB killed trees as-is, and single-tree cut-and-burn control. We found little evidence that leaving MPB killed trees as-is or controlling MPB using single-tree cut-and-burn impacted lichen cover. However, we found that lichen cover was lower in timber harvested and burned areas compared to intact undisturbed forest but only 10 to 20 years post-disturbance, respectively. Our results suggest that despite short-term reductions in lichen cover, using timber harvesting and prescribed burns to control MPB may balance management needs for MPB while maintaining lichen cover over time. However, using timber harvesting and prescribed burns to manage MPB is likely to have detrimental population-level effects on caribou by increasing the proportion of disturbed habitat and thus predators within caribou ranges. Among the four management actions that we evaluated, the cut-and-burn control program balances the need to limit the spread of MPB while also limiting negative impacts on caribou food. Our work addresses some of the challenges of managing competing forest and ecosystem values by evaluating the consequence of forest pest management actions on an important food resource for a species-at-risk.

T1  - Assessment of Disturbances across Forest Inventory Plots in the Southeastern United States for the Period 1995–2018
AN  - 2396320086
AB  - Disturbances of varying frequency and intensity shape the species composition, stand structure, and functions of forests. This study assessed the frequency and distribution of disturbances caused by eight agents (insects, diseases, fire, animals, weather, other vegetation, human, and unknown) in the forests of the southeastern United States from 1995 to 2018. We used data from 88,722 inventory measurements of 33,531 plots from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis database to assess disturbance among different forest types and to different canopy strata. Disturbances were detected in approximately 14 percent of the plots, located mostly in pine-dominated forest types. Fire was the most frequent disturbance agent (occurring 6 percent of the time), followed by weather and animal agents. The agents that caused the highest mortality rate during the period for saplings were silvicultural treatments (8.6 percent), other vegetation (5.6 percent), and fire (4.4 percent), whereas for trees they were silvicultural treatments (9.8 percent), weather (1.9 percent) and insects (1.7 percent). The forest type that appeared to have been most affected by disturbances was longleaf-slash pine of the Coastal Plain. These results are useful for understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of disturbance events in different southeastern forest types and locations and for guiding forest management activities to mitigate potential impacts. Study Implications: This study examined the spatiotemporal variation in the occurrence of eight disturbance agents across the forest types of the southeastern United States. Forest managers can benefit from these results to plan for appropriate treatments for maintaining and restoring ecosystem resilience and function. We recommend a natural disturbance-based management approach that embraces and emulates the effect of natural disturbances, such as frequent and low-severity fires, moderate ice accumulations, and intermediate-scale winds. Foresters can use the results from our study as well as additional data and information to understand the disturbance regime of their forest type, physiographic region, or state and decide on whether to implement any silvicultural treatment. For example, since the observed frequency of damage because of suppression of overtopped trees, competition, and smothering by vines in large tree diameter stands of longleaf-slash pine in Alabama and Georgia was significantly higher than expected, control of undesired trees and vines through mechanical and chemical methods and use of prescribed fires would be an appropriate prescription for these stands. Recommendations for stands managed for objectives such as wildlife habitat or recreation would be different from those for stands being used primarily for timber production.

T1  - Composite Effects of Cutlines and Wildfire Result in Fire Refuges for Plants and Butterflies in Boreal Treed Peatlands
AN  - 2258471125
AB  - The challenge of understanding how composite disturbances affect ecosystems is a central theme of modern ecology. For instance, anthropogenic footprints and wildfire are increasing globally, but how they combine remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed how a disturbance legacy of about 10-m-wide cutlines, cleared for seismic assessments of fossil fuels, affects wildfire dynamics and species assemblages in boreal peatland forests. One year after the Fort McMurray Horse River wildfire of 2016 (Alberta, Canada), we assessed differences in plant and butterfly assemblages across forests and cutlines, from unburned and severely burned peatlands. We hypothesized that, by reducing fire severity, cutlines could support plants and butterflies in the presence of a severe wildfire (the “refuge hypothesis”). Proportion of burned duff was five times higher in burned forests compared to burned cutlines (53% vs. 11%). We found 107 plant and 46 butterfly taxa, with species richness being, respectively, about 1.4 and 1.7 times higher in lines than in forests, independently from wildfire. Models for single species demonstrated different responses to disturbance, including no responses (25% of species), dominant effects of fire or lines (50%), additive effects (10%), and interactive effects (15%). Cutline refuges occurred for 20% of plant and 70% of butterfly species. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that anthropogenic refuges from fire occur in these peatland forests, yet different patterns of responses confirm the complex effects occurring with composite disturbances. Given that cutlines dissect thousands of square kilometers of boreal forests in North America, further studies should investigate their implications on recovery trajectories of these forests’ succession after wildfire.

T1  - The burning question: does fire affect habitat selection and forage preference of the black rhinoceros <i>Diceros bicornis</i> in East African savannahs?
AN  - 2352900692
AB  - Copyright © Fauna & Flora International 20182018Fauna & Flora Internationalhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The conservation of threatened species requires information on how management activities influence habitat quality. The Critically Endangered black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis is restricted to savannahs representing c. 5% of its historical range. Fire is used extensively in savannahs but little is known about how rhinos respond to burning. Our aim was to understand rhino responses to fire by studying habitat selection and foraging at multiple scales. We used resource selection functions and locations of 31 rhinos during 2014–2016 to study rhino habitat use in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Rhino selectivity was quantified by comparing forage consumption to plant species availability in randomly sampled vegetation plots; rhino diets were subsequently verified through DNA metabarcoding analysis of faecal samples. Rhino habitat use was a unimodal function of fire history, with highly occupied sites having fire frequencies of < 0.6 fires/year and maximum occupancy occurring at a fire frequency of 0.1 fires/year. Foraging stations had characteristic plant communities, with 17 species associated with rhino foraging. Rhinos were associated with, and disproportionately consumed, woody plants, forbs and legumes, all of which decreased in abundance with increasing fire frequency. In contrast to common management practices, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the current fire regime in the Serengeti negatively influences rhino habitat use and foraging and that frequent fire limits access of rhinos to preferred forage. We outline a conceptual model to guide managers and conservationists in the use of fire under variable habitat conditions.

AB  - Woodpeckers are often focal species for informing management of recently burned forests. Snags generated by wildfire provide key nesting and foraging resources for woodpeckers, and nest cavities excavated by woodpeckers are subsequently used by many other species. Habitat suitability models applicable in newly burned forest are important management tools for identifying areas likely to be used by nesting woodpeckers. Here we present and test predictive models for mapping woodpecker nest-site habitat across wildfire locations that can be used to inform post-fire planning and salvage logging decisions. From 2009 to 2016, we monitored 313 nest sites of 4 species-Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Hairy Woodpecker (Dryobates villosus), White-headed Woodpecker (D. albolarvatus), and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus)-from 3 wildfires in the Northern Sierra Nevada and Southern Cascades 1–5 yr after fire. Using these data, we developed habitat suitability index models that compared nest vs. non-nest sites for each species using (1) exclusively remotely sensed covariates, and (2) combinations of remotely sensed and field-collected covariates. We emphasized predictive performance across wildfire locations when selecting models to retain generalizable habitat relationships useful for informing management in newly burned locations. We identified models for all 4 species with strong predictive performance across wildfire locations despite notable variation in conditions among locations, suggesting broad applicability to guide post-fire management in the Sierra Nevada region. Top models for nest-site selection underscored the importance of high burn severity at the local scale, lower burn severity at the 1-km scale, mid-sized nest-tree diameters, and nest trees with broken tops. Models restricted to remotely sensed covariates exhibited similar predictive performance as combination models and are valuable for mapping habitat across entire wildfire locations to help delineate project areas or habitat reserves. Combination models are especially relevant for design of silvicultural prescriptions.Alternate abstract:Los carpinteros son usualmente usados como especies focales para informar el manejo de bosques recientemente quemados.

T1  - Browsing and fire decreases dominance of a resprouting shrub in woody encroached grassland
AN  - 2350107243
AB  - North American grasslands have experienced increased relative abundance of shrubs and trees over the last 150 yr. Alterations in herbivore composition, abundance, and grazing pressure along with changes in fire frequency are drivers that can regulate the transition from grassland to shrubland or woodland (a process known as woody encroachment). Historically, North American grasslands had a suite of large herbivores that grazed and/or browsed (i.e., bison, elk, pronghorn, deer), as well as frequent and intense fires. In the tallgrass prairie, many large native ungulates were extirpated by the 1860s, corresponding with increased homesteading (which led to decreased fire frequencies and intensities). Changes in the frequency and intensity of these two drivers (browsing and fire) have coincided with woody encroachment in tallgrass prairie. Within tallgrass prairie, woody encroachment can be categorized in to two groups: non‐resprouting species that can be killed with fire and resprouting species that cannot be killed with fire. Resprouting species require additional active management strategies to decrease abundance and eventually be removed from the ecosystem. In this study, we investigated plant cover, ramet density, and physiological effects of continuous simulated browsing and prescribed fire on Cornus drummondii C.A. Mey, a resprouting clonal native shrub species. Browsing reduced C. drummondii canopy cover and increased grass cover. We also observed decreased ramet density, which allowed for more infilling of grasses. Photosynthetic rates between browsed and unbrowsed control shrubs did not increase in 2015 or 2016. In 2017, photosynthetic rates for browsed shrubs were higher in the unburned site than the unbrowsed control shrubs at the end of the growing season. Additionally, after the prescribed fire, browsed shrubs had ~90% decreased cover, ~50% reduced ramet density, and grass cover increased by ~80%. In the roots of browsed shrubs after the prescribed fire, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) experienced a twofold reduction in glucose and a threefold reduction in both sucrose and starch. The combined effects of browsing and fire show strong potential as a successful management tool to decrease the abundance of clonal‐resprouting woody plants in mesic grasslands and illustrate the potential significance of browsers as a key driver in this ecosystem.

T1  - What are the effects of climate variability and change on ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migration in North America? A systematic map protocol
AN  - 2444101349
AB  - Background 
Climate is an important driver of ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migratory behaviors, and can affect the growth, development, fecundity, dispersal, and demographic trends of populations. Changes in temperature and precipitation, and resulting shifts in plant phenology, winter severity, drought and wildfire conditions, invasive species distribution and abundance, predation, and disease have the potential to directly or indirectly affect ungulates. However, ungulate responses to climate variability and change are not uniform and vary by species and geography. Here, we present a systematic map protocol aiming to describe the abundance and distribution of evidence on the effects of climate variability and change on ungulate life-histories, population dynamics, and migration in North America. This map will help to identify knowledge gaps and clusters of evidence, and can be used to inform future research directions and adaptive management strategies.
 Methods 
We will catalogue evidence on how climate variability and change affect the life-histories, population dynamics, and migration patterns of the fifteen ungulate species native to North America. We will search both academic and grey literature, using academic journal databases and specialist websites. Articles will be screened for inclusion at the title/abstract and full-text levels, and data will be extracted from articles that pass the full-text review. These data will be summarized quantitatively, visually, and with a narrative review to describe the distribution and abundance of evidence on the effects of climate variability and change on ungulates in North America.

T1  - An Overview of Phytophthora Species Inhabiting Declining Quercus suber Stands in Sardinia (Italy)
AN  - 2441922164
AB  - Cork oak forests are of immense importance in terms of economic, cultural, and ecological value in the Mediterranean regions. Since the beginning of the 20th century, these forests ecosystems have been threatened by several factors, including human intervention, climate change, wildfires, pathogens, and pests. Several studies have demonstrated the primary role of the oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi Ronds in the widespread decline of cork oaks in Portugal, Spain, southern France, and Italy, although other congeneric species have also been occasionally associated. Between 2015 and 2019, independent surveys were undertaken to determine the diversity of Phytophthora species in declining cork oak stands in Sardinia (Italy). Rhizosphere soil samples were collected from 39 declining cork oak stands and baited in the laboratory with oak leaflets. In addition, the occurrence of Phytophthora was assayed using an in-situ baiting technique in rivers and streams located throughout ten of the surveyed oak stands. Isolates were identified by means of both morphological characters and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA. In total, 14 different Phytophthora species were detected. Phytophthora cinnamomi was the most frequently isolated species from rhizosphere soil, followed by P. quercina, P. pseudocryptogea, and P. tyrrhenica. In contrast, P. gonapodyides turned out to be the most dominant species in stream water, followed by P. bilorbang, P. pseudocryptogea, P. lacustris, and P. plurivora. Pathogenicity of the most common Phytophthora species detected was tested using both soil infestation and log inoculation methods. This study showed the high diversity of Phytophthora species inhabiting soil and watercourses, including several previously unrecorded species potentially involved in the decline of cork oak forests.

T1  - A flexible approach for predicting and mapping postfire wood borer attacks in black spruce and jack pine forests using the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR)
AN  - 2436411045
AB  - Postfire salvage logging is used to reduce economic losses; however, burned trees are rapidly colonized by wood-boring insects, which reduce the merchantable value of the wood. This study aims to predict wood borer (Monochamus Megerle in Dejean, 1821) attacks after wildfire as a function of rapidly available variables such as tree basal area, stem diameter, and burn severity using the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR). In 2011, we sampled 60 black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) or jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) plots in five burns from 2010 in the Haute-Mauricie region of Quebec, Canada. A 50 cm bole section was debarked on seven trees in each plot to estimate wood borer attack density. Wood borer attacks were more abundant in black spruce than in jack pine. As a continuous variable, dNBR unveiled a quadratic effect of burn severity on attack density in black spruce, which was higher at moderate burn severity. In jack pine, the highest levels of attack density were found at high burn severity. Models produced in this article will help forest managers to better prioritize areas for salvage logging and thus reduce economic losses due to wood borer activity.Alternate abstract:La coupe de récupération est utilisée pour réduire les pertes économiques après un feu de forêt. Cependant, les arbres brûlés sont rapidement colonisés par des insectes xylophages, ce qui réduit la valeur marchande du bois. L’objectif de cette étude consistait à prédire la densité des attaques de xylophages (Monochamus Megerle dans Dejean, 1821) après feu, en fonction de variables rapidement disponibles, soit la surface terrière par essence, le diamètre de la tige et la sévérité du feu, à l’aide du « differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) ». En 2011, nous avons échantillonné 60 sites d’épinette noire (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns et Poggenb.) et de pin gris (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) dans cinq brûlis de 2010, en Haute-Mauricie au Québec, Canada. Sur sept arbres par site, une section de tronc de 50 cm fut écorcée afin d’estimer la densité des attaques de xylophages. Les attaques de xylophages étaient plus abondantes sur l’épinette noire que sur le pin gris. L’utilisation du dNBR en tant que variable continue a révélé un effet quadratique de la sévérité du feu sur la densité des attaques sur l’épinette noire, qui était plus élevée après un feu de sévérité modérée. Dans le pin gris, la densité maximale des attaques de xylophages était associée à un feu de sévérité élevée. Les modèles produits dans cet article aideront les aménagistes forestiers à mieux prioriser les secteurs pour des coupes de récupération et ainsi réduire les pertes économiques dues aux activités des insectes xylophages.

T1  - Tree regeneration on industrial linear disturbances in treed peatlands is hastened by wildfire and delayed by loss of microtopography
AN  - 2436411011
AB  - The world’s forests are highly fragmented by linear disturbances, and many forests have failed to recover decades after abandonment. Lack of recovery is common in unproductive forests, such as treed peatlands, because of conditions that limit tree growth, including simplification of microtopography (loss of microsites). The persistence of these features affects biodiversity, but of particular concern in Canada is the detrimental effects on threatened woodland caribou. Although natural regeneration of trees in peatlands occurs in some places, it is not an effective recovery strategy for restoring the habitat of woodland caribou. This has led to restoration activities with costs exceeding CAD$12 500/km. However, current restoration does not consider wildfires, which can destroy planted trees but also initiate early seral conditions that favor natural regeneration. Here we compared tree regeneration on seismic lines and adjacent forest controls for burnt (75 sites) and unburnt (68 sites) treed peatlands in northeast Alberta, Canada. Tree regeneration (stems with a DBH < 1 cm/ha) varied from 28 500 in burnt lines, 11 440 in unburnt lines, and 18 210 in burnt forest, to 9520 in unburnt forest. Wildfires promoted denser regeneration in sites with a greater proportion of serotinous species and water table depth. Microtopography and terrain wetness explained regeneration on burnt lines, but not unburnt lines. In burnt and unburnt lines, sunlight, microtopography, and depth of water table most affected tree regeneration patterns.Alternate abstract:Les forêts du monde sont très fragmentées par les perturbations linéaires et plusieurs de ces forêts n’ont pas encore réussi à récupérer même si elles sont abandonnées depuis des décennies. L’absence de récupération est fréquente dans les forêts improductives telles que les tourbières boisées à cause des conditions qui limitent la croissance des arbres, incluant l’uniformisation de la microtopographie (perte de microsites). La persistance de ces caractéristiques est néfaste pour la biodiversité et le Canada est particulièrement inquiet des effets préjudiciables pour le caribou des bois qui est menacé. Bien que les arbres se régénèrent naturellement dans certaines tourbières, ce n’est pas une stratégie efficace de récupération pour restaurer l’habitat du caribou des bois. Cela a entraîné des activités de restauration dont les coûts excèdent 12 500 $CAN/km. Cependant, la restauration actuelle ne tient pas compte des feux de forêt qui peuvent détruire les plantations d’arbres, mais aussi instaurer des conditions de début de succession qui favorisent la régénération naturelle. Dans cet article, nous comparons la régénération arborescente dans les lignes sismiques et les forêts témoins adjacentes dans le cas de tourbières boisées qui ont brûlé (75 sites) ou non (68 sites) dans le nord-est de l’Alberta, au Canada. La régénération arborescente (tiges avec un DHP < 1 cm/ha) varie de 28 500 tiges dans les lignes qui ont brûlé, à 11 440 dans celles qui n’ont pas brûlé, à 18 210 dans les forêts qui ont brûlé et à 9520 dans celles qui n’ont pas brûlé. Les feux de forêt ont favorisé l’apparition d’une régénération plus dense dans les sites où la proportion d’espèces sérotineuses est plus élevée et la nappe phréatique plus basse. La microtopographie et l’humidité du terrain expliquent la régénération dans les lignes qui ont brûlé mais pas dans celles qui n’ont pas brûlé. Dans les lignes qui ont brûlé ou non, l’ensoleillement, la microtopographie et la profondeur de la nappe phréatique ont le plus d’impact sur les patrons de la régénération arborescente.

T1  - Limited Effects of Long-Term Repeated Season and Interval of Prescribed Burning on Understory Vegetation Compositional Trajectories and Indicator Species in Ponderosa Pine Forests of Northeastern Oregon, USA
AN  - 2430608336
AB  - Fire exclusion has dramatically altered historically fire adapted forests across western North America. In response, forest managers reduce forest fuels with mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning to alter fire behavior, with additional objectives of restoring forest composition, structure, and ecosystem processes. There has been extensive research on the effects of fuel reduction and restoration treatments on trees, fuels, regeneration, and fire behavior; but less is known about how these treatments influence understory vegetation, which contains the majority of vascular plant diversity in many dry conifer forests. Of particular interest is how understory vegetation may respond to the season and interval of prescribed burning. The season and interval of prescribed burning is often determined by operational constraints rather than historical fire regimes, potentially resulting in fire conditions and burn intervals to which native plants are poorly adapted. In this study, we examined how understory vegetation has responded to season and interval of prescribed burning in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon, USA. Using over a decade (2002–2015) of understory vegetation data collected in stands with different intervals (5 versus 15 year) and seasons (spring versus fall) of prescribed burning, we quantified how season and interval of prescribed burning has influenced understory vegetation compositional trajectories and indicator species over time. Season of prescribed burning resulted in different understory communities and distinct trajectories of understory composition over time, but interval of burning did not. Indicator species analysis suggests fall burning is facilitating early seral species, with native annual forbs displaying ephemeral responses to frequent burning, while invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increased in abundance and frequency across all treatments over time. These findings indicate that understory vegetation in these ecosystems are sensitive to seasonality of burning, but the responses are subtle. Our findings suggest season and interval of prescribed burning used in this study do not result in large changes in understory vegetation community composition, a key consideration as land managers increase the pace and scale of prescribed fire in these forests.

T1  - Increased Genetic Diversity via Gene Flow Provides Hope for Acacia whibleyana, an Endangered Wattle Facing Extinction
AN  - 2430226996
AB  - In this paper we apply a conservation genomics approach to make evidence-based management recommendations for Acacia whibleyana, an endangered shrub endemic to Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. We used population genomic analysis to assess genetic connectivity, diversity, and historical inbreeding across all known stands of the species sampling remnant stands, revegetated stands of unknown origin, and a post-fire seedling cohort. Our results indicate a degree of historical connectivity across the landscape, but habitat loss and/or pollinator community disruption are potential causes of strong genetic structure across the remnant stands. Remnant stands had low genetic diversity and showed evidence of historical inbreeding, but only low levels of intra-stand relatedness indicating that risks of contemporary inbreeding are low. Analysis of a post-fire first generation cohort of seedlings showed they likely resulted from intra-stand matings, resulting in reduced genetic diversity compared to the parents. However, admixed seedlings in this cohort showed an increase in heterozygosity relative to likely sources and the non-admixed seedlings of the same stand. Assisted inter-stand gene flow may prove an effective management strategy to boost heterozygosity and corresponding increases in adapting capacity in this endangered species.

T1  - Regeneration dynamics of Great Basin bristlecone pine in southern Nevada
AN  - 2406287049
AB  - Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva D.K. Bailey) is an important and long-lived tree species found at high elevations in the interior southwest of the United States, but little is known about its regeneration requirements and response to disturbance. We conducted extensive surveys of seedling regeneration and environmental attributes of regeneration sites in undisturbed forest dominated by this species in the Spring Mountains of southern Nevada. Additional surveys tallied new seedling densities and site attributes 4 years after a wildfire in the same area. Seedlings, saplings, and juvenile trees were less abundant than adult trees in the unburned forest, and soils had lower bulk density and greater depth, moisture, and soil organic matter under adult trees than in open areas. Seedling distributions in both unburned and burned forest showed a negative relationship to a heat load index governed by aspect. The density of new seedlings after the fire was negatively related to distance from unburned forest edges. Seedlings were found in clusters and were associated with adult trees (live or dead) in both unburned and burned stands. Seedling emergence from animal-dispersed caches was more frequent in burned habitats than in unburned habitats. These natural regeneration dynamics provide potential guidance for restoration efforts in this ecosystem.Alternate abstract:Le pin à longue vie (Pinus longaeva D.K. Bailey) est une espèce d’arbre importante et d’une grande longévité que l’on trouve en haute altitude dans le sud-ouest continental des États-Unis. Toutefois, on sait peu de choses sur les conditions requises pour sa régénération et sur sa réaction aux perturbations. Nous avons effectué des relevés détaillés de la régénération et des conditions environnementales associées à des stations régénérées dans une forêt non perturbée et dominée par cette espèce dans la chaîne Spring au sud du Nevada. Des relevés complémentaires ont permis de recenser la densité des semis et les caractéristiques des stations quatre ans après un feu de forêt dans la même région. Les semis, les gaules et les arbres juvéniles étaient moins abondants que les arbres adultes dans la forêt non brûlée alors que les sols avaient une densité apparente plus faible et une profondeur, une humidité et une teneur en matière organique plus grandes sous les arbres adultes que dans les zones dégagées. La distribution des semis dans les forêts non brûlées et brûlées était négativement reliée à un indice de charge thermique relié à l’exposition. La densité des nouveaux semis après le feu était négativement reliée à la distance des lisières de forêts non brûlées. Les semis étaient regroupés et associés à des arbres adultes (vivants ou morts) dans les peuplements non brûlés et brûlés. L’émergence de semis à partir de caches dispersées par des animaux était plus fréquente dans les habitats brûlés que non brûlés. Cette dynamique de régénération naturelle fournit des pistes intéressantes pour guider les efforts de restauration dans cet écosystème. [Traduit par la Rédaction]

T1  - Effectiveness of Restoration Treatments for Reducing Fuels and Increasing Understory Diversity in Shrubby Mixed-Conifer Forests of the Southern Rocky Mountains, USA
AN  - 2398406236
AB  - Exclusion of natural surface fires in warm/dry mixed-conifer forests of the western U.S. has increased potential for stand-replacing crown fires and reduced resilience of these systems to other disturbances, such as drought and insect attack. Tree thinning and the application of prescribed fire are commonly used to restore more resilient ecological conditions, but currently, there is a lack of long-term data with which to evaluate restoration treatment effectiveness in forest types where resprouting shrubs dominate understory communities. At a mixed-conifer site in southwestern Colorado, we compared forest structure and understory vegetation responses to three restoration treatments (thin/burn, burn, and control) over 10 years in a completely randomized and replicated experiment. Forest density, canopy cover, and crown fuel loads were consistently lower, and crown base height was higher, in thin/burn than burn or controls, but the effects diminished over time. Ten years following treatment, >99% of all plant species within both treatments and the control were native in origin. There were no differences between treatments in understory richness, diversity, cover, or surface fuels, but graminoid cover more than doubled in all treatments over the 15-year monitoring period. Similarly, there was more than a 250% increase post-treatment in shrub density, with the greatest increases in the thin/burn treatment. In addition, we saw an increase in the average shrub height for both treatments and the control, with shrub stems >80 cm becoming the dominant size class in the thin/burn treatment. Conifer seedling density was significantly lower in thin/burn compared with burn and control treatments after 10 years. Taken together, these conditions create challenges for managers aiming to reestablish natural fire patterns and sustain mixed-conifer forests. To limit the dominance of resprouting shrubs and facilitate conifer regeneration after overstory thinning and prescribed fire, managers may need to consider new or more intensive approaches to forest restoration, particularly given current and projected climate change.

T1  - Locating Forest Management Units Using Remote Sensing and Geostatistical Tools in North-Central Washington, USA
AN  - 2396609512
AB  - In this study, we share an approach to locate and map forest management units with high accuracy and with relatively rapid turnaround. Our study area consists of private, state, and federal land holdings that cover four counties in North-Central Washington, USA (Kittitas, Okanogan, Chelan and Douglas). This area has a rich history of landscape change caused by frequent wildfires, insect attacks, disease outbreaks, and forest management practices, which is only partially documented across ownerships in an inconsistent fashion. To consistently quantify forest management activities for the entire study area, we leveraged Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, LANDFIRE existing vegetation types and disturbances, monitoring trends in burn severity fire perimeters, and Landsat 8 Burned Area products. Within our methodology, Sentinel-2 images were collected and transformed to orthogonal land cover change difference and ratio metrics using principal component analyses. In addition, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Relativized Burn Ratio index were estimated. These variables were used as predictors in Random Forests machine learning classification models. Known locations of forest treatment units were used to create samples to train the Random Forests models to estimate where changes in forest structure occurred between the years of 2016 and 2019. We visually inspected each derived polygon to manually assign one treatment class, either clearcut or thinning. Landsat 8 Burned Area products were used to derive prescribed fire units for the same period. The bulk of analyses were performed using the RMRS Raster Utility toolbar that facilitated spatial, statistical, and machine learning tools, while significantly reducing the required processing time and storage space associated with analyzing these large datasets. The results were combined with existing LANDFIRE vegetation disturbance and forest treatment data to create a 21-year dataset (1999–2019) for the study area.

T1  - Social and Ecological Dimensions of Urban Conservation Grasslands and Their Management through Prescribed Burning and Woody Vegetation Removal
AN  - 2395483048
AB  - Natural grasslands are threatened globally. In south-eastern Australia, remnants of critically endangered natural grasslands are increasingly being isolated in urban areas. Urbanisation has led to reduced fire frequency and woody plant encroachment in some patches. Grasslands are currently being managed under the assumption that desirable management actions to address these threats (prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation) (1) lead to improved conservation outcomes and (2) are restricted by negative public attitudes. In this study, we tested these two assumptions in the context of native grassland conservation reserves in Melbourne, Australia. Firstly, we investigated differences in species and functional trait composition between patches that had been recently burnt, patches that were unburnt and patches subject to woody vegetation encroachment. We found that the functional traits of species converged in areas subject to woody plant encroachment and areas frequently disturbed by fire. Burning promoted native species, and patches of woody plants supressed the dominant grass, providing a wider range of habitat conditions. Secondly, we surveyed 477 residents living adjacent to these grassland conservation reserves to measure values, beliefs and attitudes and the acceptance of prescribed burning and removing woody vegetation. We found conflict in people’s attitudes to grasslands, with both strongly positive and strongly negative attitudes expressed. The majority of residents found prescribed burning an acceptable management practice (contrary to expectations) and removing trees and shrubs from grasslands to be unacceptable. Both cognitive factors (values and beliefs) and landscape features were important in influencing these opinions. This research provides some guidance for managing urban grassland reserves as a social–ecological system, showing that ecological management, community education and engagement and landscape design features can be integrated to influence social and ecological outcomes.

T1  - The effect of season and post-fire on habitat preferences of the endangered Swayne’s hartebeest (<i>Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei</i>) in Maze National Park, Ethiopia
AN  - 2357342693
AB  - Background 
The availability of preferred habitats determines the spatial and temporal distribution of herbivores in savanna ecosystems. Understanding habitat preference of a targeted wildlife species is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Habitat preference of large grazers in connection to grass height and post-fire effect has been debated for the last century. Here, we examined the effects of season, grass height and burning on the habitat preference on Swayne’s hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei) in Maze National Park. Data for seasonal habitat selection were collected using both direct observation along established transect lines and pellet counting using permanently established plots. Every month, we measured grass height commonly preferred by Swayne’s hartebeest in grassland habitat. Starting from the first week of burning, we recorded the abundance of Swayne’s hartebeest in both burned and unburned grassland patches.
 Results 
From detected pellets, 94.3% were recorded in the grassland habitat indicating that other habitat types are less used despite their extensive cover > 50% of the Park. During wet and early dry seasons, Swayne’s hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat. We found that 85.2% (n = 1079) and 85.3% (n = 593) of individuals observed in areas with a grass height below 30 cm during wet and early-dry seasons, respectively; while 70.9% (n = 2288) preferred grass height below 30 cm during the dry season. The density of Swayne’s hartebeest in burned grassland area was higher than unburned grassland areas up to 150 days since burning. However, in unburned grassland areas, the density was initially low but showed increasing trend for consecutive days, reaching similar density with burned areas after 150 days since burning.
 Conclusion 
Swayne’s hartebeest exclusively preferred grassland habitat, particularly during wet and early-dry seasons, shortest available grass height in all seasons and were attracted to burned grassland areas. Our results suggested that fire played an important role in maintaining habitat quality in grassland, and that management should continue using controlled burning as a tool for the conservation of Swayne’s hartebeest. However, we remain cautious of our findings given the paucity of information regarding other confounding factors and the absence of long-term data on fire disturbance.

T1  - Wildfire and fire mosaic effects on bird species richness and community composition in south-western Australia
AN  - 2348262341
AB  - BackgroundA fire management strategy of deliberate patch-mosaic burning (PMB) is postulated to promote biodiversity by providing a range of habitat patches with different fire histories, habitat qualities, and vegetation ages at a given scale. We investigated the response of avian fauna to fire, particularly species richness and community composition, in a landscape composed of a diversity of vegetation ages including long-unburned refuges (age 26 years), compared with a landscape of uniform vegetation ages recovering from an extensive and intense fire.ResultsThere was no effect of heterogeneity in vegetation age on species richness at whole forest management block (about 6000 ha), or local (2 ha) scales. There were different responses of particular species to vegetation age. Nine species showed responses to vegetation age at local (2 ha) scales, which is presumably a surrogate for availability of key resources and which changes over time. Australian Pipit (Anthus australis Vieillot, 1818) were absent from swamp vegetation <3.5 years old, while Spotted Pardalote (Pardalotus punctatus Shaw & Nodder, 1792) were only found in forest vegetation <3.5 years old. Year-to-year changes in local assemblages were detected after removing the effect of time since fire. There was no difference in effect of the two fire regimes on assemblage composition or feeding-guild structure.ConclusionsMosaics of different vegetation ages had no net benefit for biodiversity, as measured by species richness and assemblage composition, at the forest block management unit scale. Different responses to vegetation age among bird species did not lead to increased bird richness at the scale of forest management block. A potential advantage of mosaics in conservation of avian biodiversity is through preservation of patches of older vegetation ages in the landscape, compared to the periodic extensive loss of older vegetation ages in wildfires. However, the absence of large-scale effects of vegetation age on bird species richness, the tendency for birds to specialize to fuel ages >5.5 years in the landscape studied, and indications of flexible responses of some species at landscape scales allows some flexibility in fuel management strategies and the scale at which they are applied with respect to avifauna.

T1  - Fire-adapted traits of threatened shrub species in riparian refugia: implications for fire regime management
AN  - 2343352268
AB  - Fire management at the landscape scale may be detrimental to threatened species restricted to fire refugia, such as riparian zones, if their fire response is assumed based on the broader vegetation community type. Conserving threatened plant species in fire-prone habitats requires understanding how life-history traits allow persistence under prevailing fire regimes. Using three threatened Pomaderris species associated with riparian zones in south-east Australia, we tested for evidence of fire-adapted traits to identify if key life-history traits are coupled to specific fire cues and determine how their current distribution relates to prevailing fire regimes. We did this by (i) exposing seeds to heat-shock treatments with fire-related temperatures (60–100 °C) in germination trials; (ii) testing for the presence of a soil-stored seed bank and its response to fire by using ex-situ experimental burns on soil samples and (iii) conducting field surveys of post-fire demographic responses for P. adnata. All species showed maximum germination following heat-shock treatment at 100 °C, strongly suggesting adaptation to high severity fire. Seedling emergence from soil samples was positively affected by fire for P. bodalla and P. walshii, while there was an in situ post-fire germination pulse in P. adnata seedling recruitment and moderate increases in resprouting and survivorship of mature plants. The study demonstrates that these riparian-occurring species have life-history traits that may enable persistence under high severity fire and highlights how the possession of bet-hedging strategies may allow species to use riparian zones as fire refugia in a landscape dominated by an anthropogenically altered fire regime.

T1  - Fire-associated reptile mortality in Tembe Elephant Park, South Africa
AN  - 2343268041
AB  - BackgroundEven though fire has been used extensively as part of conservation management in South Africa, its impact on the life history and mortality of fossorial reptiles is poorly documented. We conducted post-fire transects after three controlled burns during different seasons in Tembe Elephant Park, recorded 14 reptile species, and found fewer mortalities in winter compared to spring.ResultsHistopathological examinations of species were conducted from different microhabitats to elucidate the possible cause of death. The unburned condition of most mortality specimens prompted suspicion of particulate smoke inhalation as a possible cause of death. However, the relative absence of carbon-rich particulate matter and the occasional presence of pulmonary oedema suggested asphyxiation, heat-induced cardiac arrest, or gas intoxication as the most likely cause of death. The association of most specimens with microhabitats rich in leaf litter may indicate higher reptile densities in this habitat or increased mortalities due to smoldering detrital material, or both. Detrital combustion and smoldering may result in advective transportation of heated gasses into underlying soil layers, with subsequent increased mortalities.ConclusionEven though burrowing could potentially offer protection from fire to fossorial vertebrates through vertical movements into deeper substrate, our results indicated that they are not necessarily protected from fire effects. We speculate that seasonal reproductive behavior may contribute to fire mortality. These observations may contribute to improved understanding and management of fire in areas where fossorial reptiles occur.

T1  - Can Mowing Substitute for Fire in Semiarid Grassland?
AN  - 2330519857
AB  - Accumulating data indicate the importance of fire in rangeland systems. Mowing is a common management technique sometimes considered a surrogate for fire. However, direct comparisons of fire and mowing effects are limited. Our objective was to determine whether mowing can substitute for fire in rangeland by comparing effects on plant biomass, composition, cover, soil nutrients, and forage quality. Three disturbance treatments (nontreated control, spring mowing with clipping removal, and spring fire) were randomly assigned to 21 plots (5 × 5 m) each on silty and claypan ecological sites in a completely randomized design, with seven replications per site. Current-yr biomass was similar among control, mowed, and burned treatments (1 003, 974, 1 022 ± 64 kg ● ha−1). Mowing shifted functional group composition by reducing C3 perennial grass 12% and increasing forbs 8%. Non-native species were a larger component of mowed (12%) than control (6%) or burned plots (4%). Fire increased bare ground 35%, reduced litter 32%, and eliminated previous yrs’ growth the first growing season. Plant-available soil N and S more than doubled with fire, and there was a trend for more P in burned plots. Mowing effects were limited to a trend for less soil Fe. Mowing affected 42% of the forage quality variables with a 2% average improvement across all variables. Fire affected 84% of the variables, with a 12% average improvement. Mowing increased forage P and K, whereas fire increased forage concentrations of N, K, P, S, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Cu. Total digestible nutrients increased 1.1% with mowing and 2.1% with fire. In vitro dry matter disappearance increased 2.2% with mowing and 6.7% with fire. Burned plots had greater in vitro fermentation than controls or mowed plots. Although mowing can be a useful management tool, it is not a substitute for the ecological effects of rangeland fire.

T1  - Den Site Selection by the Florida Spotted Skunk
AN  - 2324823190
AB  - The eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) is a species of conservation concern in much of its range and has experienced a decline since the early to mid‐1990s. But the subspecies that inhabits peninsular Florida, the Florida spotted skunk (S. p. ambarvalis), might still be abundant and is an important nest predator of the endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus). To gain insight on this little‐studied subspecies and inform potential management strategies, we conducted a resource selection study on the Florida spotted skunk. We examined 5 hypotheses for den site selection related to den type, vegetation, and landscape characteristics in a dry prairie ecosystem in central Florida. We tracked 36 individual skunks to 757 den sites. Using discrete choice analysis, we found that male and nonbreeding female skunks at our study site were 5 times more likely to select a mammal burrow over a gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) burrow, that selection of a den site increased 34% for each 1‐burrow increase in the number of nearby burrows, and that selection of a den site increased 3% for every 10‐cm increase in a visual obstruction index. Similarly, breeding female skunks were more likely to select mammal burrows and shallow depressions over gopher tortoise burrows by 16‐fold and 13‐fold, respectively, and selection of a den site increased by 75% for every 1‐burrow increase in the number of nearby burrows. In contrast to previous studies that occurred in forested, mountainous environments elsewhere in the species' range, our findings suggest that den characteristics might be more important than landscape or vegetation characteristics to Florida spotted skunk den site selection in dry prairie. Additionally, the frequency of prescribed fires on the landscape did not appear to affect Florida spotted skunk den site selection. Thus, Florida spotted skunks in this ecosystem might be landscape generalists, thereby potentially limiting the ability of managers to control nest predation by this subspecies through habitat management. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Female Greater Prairie‐Chicken response to energy development and rangeland management
AN  - 2333583686
AB  - Wildlife habitat use is the result of behaviors that occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The interactions between these behaviors can often result in complex patterns of selection that can make it challenging to select the most appropriate scale to implement management actions. Greater Prairie‐Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido), a declining grassland grouse species, face many conservation challenges throughout its distribution, including increased fragmentation from anthropogenic activities (e.g., energy development and altered disturbance regimes). However, much of the literature on this species has focused on a narrow portion of its lifecycle, specifically the breeding season. We examined habitat use of female Greater Prairie‐Chickens in a grassland that is managed with prescribed fire and grazing and that has also undergone considerable development for oil and gas production. We developed discrete choice models for four behaviorally distinct life‐history stages and two spatial scales to evaluate how rangeland management, energy development, and scale influence habitat use throughout the annual cycle. Additionally, we used cumulative distribution functions to determine response distances to landscape features. We found that time since fire, proximity to woodlands and proximity of lek sites were the most consistent predictors of habitat use during most periods and spatial scales. Greater Prairie‐Chickens consistently avoided woodlands and remained relatively close to lek sites during all parts of the year. Selection of time since fire varied through the year with Greater Prairie‐Chickens primarily using unburned patches in the lekking and nesting season and recently burned patches in the post‐nesting and nonbreeding season. Greater Prairie‐Chickens demonstrated a seasonally variable response to energy development, avoiding power lines and areas with a high densities of oil wells by as much as 300–600 m in the lekking, post‐nesting, and nonbreeding season. Management actions that promote vegetation heterogeneity will benefit Greater Prairie‐Chickens by creating a variety of seral stages used during different life stages, but efforts should be made to limit future fragmentation of grasslands by energy development.

T1  - Fire as a key driver of Earth's biodiversity
AN  - 2309621223
AB  - Many terrestrial ecosystems are fire prone, such that their composition and structure are largely due to their fire regime. Regions subject to regular fire have exceptionally high levels of species richness and endemism, and fire has been proposed as a major driver of their diversity, within the context of climate, resource availability and environmental heterogeneity. However, current fire‐management practices rarely take into account the ecological and evolutionary roles of fire in maintaining biodiversity. Here, we focus on the mechanisms that enable fire to act as a major ecological and evolutionary force that promotes and maintains biodiversity over numerous spatiotemporal scales. From an ecological perspective, the vegetation, topography and local weather conditions during a fire generate a landscape with spatial and temporal variation in fire‐related patches (pyrodiversity), and these produce the biotic and environmental heterogeneity that drives biodiversity across local and regional scales. There have been few empirical tests of the proposition that ‘pyrodiversity begets biodiversity’ but we show that biodiversity should peak at moderately high levels of pyrodiversity. Overall species richness is greatest immediately after fire and declines monotonically over time, with postfire successional pathways dictated by animal habitat preferences and varying lifespans among resident plants. Theory and data support the ‘intermediate disturbance hypothesis’ when mean patch species diversity is correlated with mean fire intervals. Postfire persistence, recruitment and immigration allow species with different life histories to coexist. From an evolutionary perspective, fire drives population turnover and diversification by promoting a wide range of adaptive responses to particular fire regimes. Among 39 comparisons, the number of species in 26 fire‐prone lineages is much higher than that in their non‐fire‐prone sister lineages. Fire and its byproducts may have direct mutagenic effects, producing novel genotypes that can lead to trait innovation and even speciation. A paradigm shift aimed at restoring biodiversity‐maintaining fire regimes across broad landscapes is required among the fire research and management communities. This will require ecologists and other professionals to spread the burgeoning fire‐science knowledge beyond scientific publications to the broader public, politicians and media.

T1  - Prescribed fire maintains host plants of a rare grassland butterfly
AN  - 2314540179
AB  - As grassland ecosystems transform globally due to anthropogenic pressures, improvements in our understanding of the effect of management on rare and threatened species in such landscapes has become urgent. Although prescribed fire is a very efficient tool for habitat restoration and endangered species management on fire-adapted ecosystems, the specific mechanisms underlying potential effects of burning on population dynamics of butterfly host plants are poorly understood. We analyzed a 12-year dataset (2004–2015), combining violet abundance, habitat physiognomy and fire history data from a fire-managed system, to determine factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution and abundance of violets (Viola spp.), the host plants of the threatened eastern regal fritillary (Speyeria idalia idalia) butterfly. Our results demonstrate a critical role for fire in driving both presence and abundance of violets, suggesting management with prescribed fires can effectively promote butterfly host plants. In addition, we determined the character of habitats associated with violet presence and abundance, in particular a strong positive association with biocrusts. These results provide a roadmap for efficient site selection to increase the effectiveness of restoration efforts, including assessment of potential reintroduction sites for regal fritillary and other grassland butterflies and actions to promote the re-establishment of host plants in these sites.

T1  - Growing or dormant season burns: the effects of burn season on bee and plant communities
AN  - 2275700984
AB  - Habitat management can play a critical role in increasing and maintaining species diversity, but timing of management techniques can have significant effects on biodiversity management. In tallgrass prairie systems, prescribed burns are a common method to promote diversity. Managers prefer winter dormant season burns but this timing differs significantly from the historic growing season burns that helped shape this community, and it is largely unexplored whether changing burn season has significant effects on higher trophic levels. Here we investigate how the timing of such burns affects the bee communities and their resources. Depending on life history traits such as above or below ground nesting, timing of fire management can have differential effects on bee diversity. In 2016 and 2017, bees were collected from prairies in south-central Illinois using active netting, pan traps, and vane traps, and measurements of plant species, flower abundance and ground cover were recorded. While both burns showed significant improvement over unburned areas, growing season burns had the greatest total bare ground area and an increase in overall bee abundances. This may suggest long term benefits of growing season burns. The results suggest that growing season burns are beneficial for bees, and the use of either burn season can be utilized for land management.

T1  - Megafire effects on spotted owls: elucidation of a growing threat and a response to Hanson et al. (2018)
AN  - 2301076283
AB  - The extent to which wildfire adversely affects spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) is a key consideration for ecosystem restoration efforts in seasonally dry forests of the western United States. Recently,Jones et al. (2016)demonstrated that the 2014 King Fire (a “megafire”) adversely affected a population of individually-marked California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) monitored as part of a long-term demographic study in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA because territory occupancy declined substantially at territories burned at high-severity and GPS-tagged spotted owls avoided large patches of high-severity fire.Hanson et al. (2018)attempted to reassess changes in territory occupancy of theJones et al. (2016)study population and claimed that occupancy declined as a result of post-fire salvage logging not fire per se and suggested that the avoidance of GPS-marked owls from areas that burned at high-severity was due to post-fire logging rather than a response to high-severity fire. Here, we demonstrate thatHanson et al. (2018)used erroneous data, inadequate statistical analyses and faulty inferences to reach their conclusion that the King Fire did not affect spotted owls and, more broadly, that large, high-severity fires do not pose risks to spotted owls in western North American dry forest ecosystems. We also provide further evidence indicating that the King Fire exerted a clear and significant negative effect on our marked study population of spotted owls. Collectively, the additional evidence presented here and inJones et al. (2016)suggests that large, high-severity fires can pose a threat to spotted owls and that restoration of natural low- to mixed-severity frequent fire regimes would likely benefit both old-forest species and dry forest ecosystems in this era of climate change. Meeting these dual objectives of species conservation and forest restoration will be complex but it is made more challenging by faulty science that does not acknowledge the full range of wildfire effects on spotted owls.

T1  - Predicting the distribution and abundance of invasive plant species in a sub-tropical woodland-grassland ecosystem in northeastern India
AN  - 2267279347
AB  - Invasive plant species have become increasingly problematic in tropical and sub-tropical ecosystems, with the potential to decrease native plant diversity, increase fire occurrence, and cause ecosystem degradation. Numerous factors including disturbance due to fire, grazing, roads, human activities, reduction of native diversity, and soil fertility are known to influence invasibility of a habitat and/or promote the spread of invasive species. We studied invasive species distribution and abundance in a 519 km2 wildlife reserve that has sub-tropical woodland and grasslands. We sampled 134 plots of size 30 × 30 m2 and found that Mikania micrantha (a climber) and Chromolaena odorata (a shrub) were the most prominent invasive plants. We then tested the influence of eleven environmental variables that are either direct measures or proxies of resource availability, vegetation density, disturbance, and moisture stress. Using these predictors, we performed a decision-tree-based regression and prediction to test the influence of these variables on invasive species abundance and to generate distribution maps. The model had significant predictive power in the case of Mikania (R2 = 0.469) but was poor for Chromolaena (R2 = 0.056). Annual precipitation, soil phosphorus, and vegetation attributes had a significant influence in Mikania, and fire frequency had the strongest influence on Chromolaena. We could not quantify direct disturbance such as cattle grazing and resource extraction, which could add to the predictive power for these species. Given that invasive species continue to expand in range and abundance, more directed ecological monitoring and analyses are needed to manage ecosystems under the threat of invasions.

T1  - Large scale burning for a threatened ungulate in a biodiversity hotspot is detrimental for grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Caelifera)
AN  - 2260277335
AB  - Habitat management strategies across the globe are often focusing on flagship species, such as large threatened mammals. This is also true for most protected areas of India, where large mammals such as the Tiger or Asian Elephant represent focal species of conservation management, although a shift towards other species groups can be observed in recent times. Prescribed burning is a controversially debated method to manage open habitat types. This method is practised as a tool to manage the habitat of the endangered Nilgiri tahr, Nilgiritragus hylocrius (an endemic goat) at a large scale (50 ha grids) in Eravikulam National Park of the Western Ghats (Kerala, India). However, the impact of prescribed burning on other biota of this unique environment in a global biodiversity hotspot has not been studied. We compared the impact of large-scale prescribed burning on grasshopper abundances in Eravikulam National Park with small-scale burning in Parambikulam Tiger Reserve from 2015 to 2018, to assess the impact of the different fire management practices of these reserves on this species-rich insect group. We observed a negative response of grasshoppers to burning of larger contiguous areas in terms of their recovery after fire events, whereas burning small patches in a mosaic pattern facilitated rapid recovery of grasshopper communities. Our results suggest that burning management can be optimized to benefit both, the flagship vertebrate species as well as species-rich invertebrate communities.

T1  - Vulnerability of forest ecosystems to fire in the French Alps
AN  - 2243876911
AB  - Forest fires are expected to be more frequent and more intense with climate change, including in temperate and mountain forest ecosystems. In the Alps, forest vulnerability to fire resulting from interactions between climate, fuel types, vegetation structure and tree resistance to fire is little understood. This paper aims at identifying trends in the vulnerability of Alpine forest ecosystems to fire at different scales (tree species, stand level and biogeographic level) and according to three different climatic conditions (cold season, average summer and extremely dry summer). To explore Alpine forest vulnerability to fire, we used surface fuel measurements, forest inventory and fire weather data to simulate fire behaviour and ultimately post-fire tree mortality across 4438 forest plots in the French Alps. The results showed that cold season fires (about 50% of the fires in the French Alps) have a limited impact except on low-elevation forests of the Southern Alps (mainly Oak, Scots pine). In average summer conditions, mixed and broadleaved forests of low elevations suffer the highest mortality rates (up to 75% in coppices). Finally, summer fires occurring in extremely dry conditions promote high mortality across all forest communities. Lowest mortality rates were observed in high forest stands composed of tree species presenting adaptation to surface fires (e.g. thick bark, high canopy) such as Larch forests of the internal Alps. This study provides insights on the vulnerability of the main tree species and forest ecosystems of the French Alps useful for the adaptation of forest management practices to climate changes.

T1  - Wandering spiders recover more slowly than web-building spiders after fire
AN  - 2264479215
AB  - Fire is a natural feature of many ecosystems, with some vegetation types highly adapted to fire. However, very little is known about the effect of fire on spiders, especially as fires have become more frequent owing to human activity. We determine whether different spider functional guilds (web builders vs. wanderers) respond differently to fires in the sclerophyllous fynbos. We determine also the effect of rockiness as refuge for these guilds and whether it influences their post-fire recovery. There were three site categories of time-since-last fire: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years. We found that fire caused a decline in spider richness and abundance, with the 3-month category supporting the lowest. In sites that were burned within 1 year, abundance of wanderers was as high as in sites that had 7 years to recover, whereas species richness and abundance of web builders in sites that were burned 1 year ago were as low as in recently burned sites. However, assemblages of wanderers differed among categories, while no differences were observed for web builders, highlighting that wanderers took longer time to recover than web builders. Species richness and abundance of both guilds were not affected by different levels of rockiness. However, rockiness is important in shaping assemblages of wanderers. The results emphasize that the assemblages of greatest conservation concern with increased fire frequencies are wanderers and are candidate surrogates for monitoring post-fire recovery. These results highlight the need to allow fynbos vegetation to recover fully between fire intervals and draws attention to the dangers of frequent unplanned fires.

T1  - Nest site selection and nest survival of Black-backed Woodpeckers after wildfire
TT  - Selección del sitio de anidación y supervivencia del nido de Picoides arcticus luego de un fuego silvestre
AN  - 2283078290
AB  - Recently burned coniferous forests host wildlife communities that respond to variation in burn severity, post-fire habitat structure, and patch configuration. Habitat selection theory predicts that birds inhabiting these variable post-fire landscapes will select nesting locations that confer an adaptive advantage through increased fitness and reproductive success. Understanding the effect of post-fire habitat on avian nesting ecology can provide valuable information to guide restoration and management after wildfire. The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forests in the western United States, where it is used as an indicator species for the effects of post-fire forest management. Between 2011 and 2018, we located and monitored 118 Black-backed Woodpecker nests in burned forests of northern California. We evaluated the influence of habitat and nest characteristics on nest site selection and daily nest survival. Our results demonstrate a pattern of neutral congruence between habitat selection and fitness. Black-backed Woodpeckers showed strong selection for each of the nest habitat variables that we measured: woodpeckers selected moderately sized trees in areas of high snag density burned at high severity, but also in areas relatively close to low-severity or unburned edges. However, only nest initiation date affected nest survival, with decreased survival in late-season nests. Our results suggest that management actions aimed at maintaining breeding habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers should prioritize retention and creation of pyrodiverse landscapes that include dense stands of snags (>5 snags per 100 m2) within ~500 m of forest that burned at low severity or remained unburned.Alternate abstract:Los bosques de coníferas recientemente quemados albergan comunidades de vida silvestre que responden a la intensidad del fuego, a la estructura del hábitat luego del fuego y a la configuración de los parches. La teoría de la selección de hábitat predice que las aves que habitan estos paisajes incendiados diversos seleccionarán aquellas ubicaciones de los nidos que les confieran una ventaja adaptativa a través de un aumento en la adecuación biológica y en el éxito reproductivo. Entender el efecto del hábitat incendiado en la ecología de anidación de las aves puede brindar información valiosa para guiar la restauración y el manejo luego de los fuegos silvestres. Picoides arcticus está fuertemente asociado con bosques recientemente quemados en el oeste de EEUU, donde es usado como una especie indicadora de los efectos del manejo del bosque luego del fuego. Entre 2011 y 2018, localizamos y monitoreamos 118 nidos de P. arcticus en bosques quemados del norte de California. Evaluamos la influencia de las características del hábitat y del nido en la selección del nido y en la supervivencia diaria del nido. Nuestros resultados demuestran un patrón de congruencia neutral entre la selección del hábitat y la adecuación biológica. P. arcticus mostró una fuerte selección de cada una de las variables del hábitat del nido que medimos: los carpinteros seleccionaron árboles de tamaño moderado en áreas de alta densidad de tocones severamente quemados, pero también en áreas relativamente cercanas a bordes con baja severidad o no quemados. Sin embargo, solo la fecha de inicio del nido afectó la supervivencia del nido, con una disminución en la supervivencia de los nidos de fines de estación. Nuestros resultados sugieren que las acciones de manejo destinadas al mantenimiento del hábitat reproductivo para P. arcticus debería priorizar la retención y creación de paisajes pirodiversos que incluyan rodales densos de tocones (>5 tocones por 100 m2) dentro de los ~500 m de bosque quemado con baja severidad o que permaneció no quemado.

T1  - Annual Fire Return Interval Influences Nutritional Carrying Capacity of White-Tailed Deer in Pine– Hardwood Forests
AN  - 2282422954
AB  - Prescribed fire is a cost-effective habitat management tool in pine stands to enhance the quantity and quality of forage available for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Management recommendations typically suggest a 3- to 5-year burn rotation in mixed pine-hardwood stands to increase quality forage production, but as fire frequency increases, forb and legume biomass increases, and woody browse decreases. A more frequent burn rotation may be a viable management option for deer managers, but there is still a lack of information regarding preferred forage and nutritional carrying capacity response to prescribed fire at these intervals. We measured the production and nutritional quality of forage within mature pine-hardwood stands after a 1- or 2-year fire-return interval during three nutritionally stressful periods for deer on a 640-acre (259-hectare) enclosure located in east-central Alabama during 2014 and 2015. These stands had previously been burned annually for over 15 years, resulting in an abundance of herbaceous vegetation. We then compared forage class biomass, nutritional carrying capacity estimates, and digestible protein between burn treatments. A 1-year fire return interval improved habitat quality to a greater degree than a 2-year fire return interval by increasing the production of forage able to support greater nutritional planes. An annual burn rotation is an effective option for managers to increase protein availability in pine-hardwood stands, but other factors such as decreased cover availability and soft mast production should also be considered.

T1  - Development and participatory evaluation of fireline intensity and flame property models for managed burns on <i>Calluna</i>-dominated heathlands
AN  - 2275793223
AB  - BackgroundPrescribed burning plays an important role in the management of many ecosystems and can also be used to mitigate landscape-scale fire risk. Safe and effective application of prescribed fire requires that managers have a robust understanding of potential fire behavior in order to decide on the appropriate tools and tactics for any burning operation. Shrubland ecosystems, including heaths and moors, are known to exhibit intense fire behavior under marginal burning conditions under which fire would not be expected to spread in other vegetation types. This makes developing fire behavior predictions for such systems important. Traditional managed burning is widely used as a tool in Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull-dominated heath and moorland landscapes in northwest Europe, but in some regions, especially the United Kingdom, there is significant debate over fire use. Despite the controversy, there is general agreement on the need to (1) understand relationships between fuel structure and potential fire behavior, and (2) improve burning practice to optimize potential trade-offs between different ecosystem services. Our aim was to provide knowledge to improve management practice by developing models of potential fireline intensity and flame length. We conducted 27 burns in three developmental stages of Calluna with different stand structures and estimated fireline intensity, flame length, flame height, and flame angle. Flame properties were assessed using photographs and visual observation. We evaluated our models using a participatory research approach for which conservation and land managers submitted basic observations on fire behavior and fire weather for their burns.ResultsFireline intensity and flame height increased significantly across age-related Calluna phases. Regression modeling revealed that fireline intensity could be adequately estimated by a combination of fuel height and wind speed, with taller fuels and higher wind speeds related to more intense fires. Predictions were, however, improved by accounting for live fuel moisture content. Flame length and height were modeled as a function of fireline intensity using standard approaches, but adequately performing models for flame angle could not be established. Evaluation data provided by land managers was noisy, but their qualitative assessments of fire behavior and estimates of flame length were significantly correlated with predictions from our models.ConclusionsFire intensities and flame properties seen in northern Calluna heathlands are similar to those encountered in shrublands associated with climates and fuels more commonly perceived as representing high fire danger. The results demonstrated that our models perform tolerably well although there is substantial uncertainty in their predictions. The models were used to develop a fire behavior nomogram that can provide an indication of potential fireline intensity and flame length prior to commencing a burn.Alternate abstract:AntecedentesLas quemas prescriptas juegan un rol importante en el manejo de varios ecosistemas y pueden también ser usadas para mitigar el riesgo de incendio a escala de paisaje. La aplicación efectiva y segura del fuego prescripto requiere que quienes lo aplican tengan un conocimiento robusto del comportamiento potencial del fuego para poder decidir sobre las tácticas y herramientas apropiadas en cualquier operación de quema. Los ecosistemas de arbustales, incluyendo brezales y páramos, son conocidos por exhibir un comportamiento de fuego intenso en condiciones marginales, bajo las cuales el fuego no se propagaría en otros ecosistemas. El manejo tradicional de quemas es ampliamente usado como una herramienta de manejo en Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull dominados por brezales y páramos en el noroeste de Europa, aunque en algunas regiones, especialmente en el Reino Unido, hay un debate significativo sobre el uso del fuego. A pesar de esa controversia, hay un consenso general sobre: 1) entender las relaciones entre estructura del combustible y comportamiento potencial del fuego, y 2) mejorar las prácticas de quemas para optimizar el potencial balance entre diferentes servicios ecosistémicos. Nuestro objetivo fue proveer del conocimiento para mejorar las prácticas de manejo mediante el desarrollo de modelos de intensidad de línea y longitud de llama. Condujimos 27 quemas en tres estados de desarrollo de Calluna en stands con diferentes estructuras, y estimamos intensidad de línea, longitud de llama, altura de llama, y ángulo de llama. Evaluamos nuestro modelo mediante la aproximación a una investigación participativa para la cual conservacionistas y manejadores de tierras enviaron observaciones básicas sobre comportamiento y meteorología del fuego de sus quemas.ResultadosLa intensidad de línea y la altura de llama se incrementaron significativamente a través de las fases relacionadas con la edad de Calluna. Los modelos de regresión revelaron que la intensidad de línea puede ser adecuadamente estimada mediante una combinación de la altura del combustible y la velocidad del viento, con combustibles más altos y mayores velocidades de viento relacionadas con fuegos más intensos. Las predicciones fueron por supuesto mejoradas cuando se tuvo en cuenta la humedad del combustible vivo. La longitud y altura de llama fueron modeladas usando aproximaciones standard, aunque aun usando modelos adecuados no fue posible establecer el ángulo de llamas. La evaluación de los datos provistos por manejadores de tierras fue intrincado, aunque las determinaciones cualitativa del comportamiento del fuego y las estimaciones de longitud de llama se correlacionaron significativamente con predicciones de nuestros modelos.ConclusionesLas intensidades de fuego y las propiedades de las llamas observadas en los brezales de Calluna del norte son similares a aquellos encontrados en arbustales asociados con climas que se perciben como representativos de un alto grado de peligro. Los resultados demostraron que nuestros modelos se comportan de manera aceptable, aunque hay cierto grado de incertidumbre en sus predicciones. Los modelos fueron usados para desarrollar un nomograma de comportamiento que puede proveer una indicación de la intensidad potencial de la línea de fuego y de la longitud de llama antes de comenzar con la quema.

T1  - The potential importance of unburned islands as refugia for the persistence of wildlife species in fire‐prone ecosystems
AN  - 2269331397
AB  - The persistence of wildlife species in fire‐prone ecosystems is under increasing pressure from global change, including alterations in fire regimes caused by climate change. However, unburned islands might act to mitigate negative effects of fire on wildlife populations by providing habitat in which species can survive and recolonize burned areas. Nevertheless, the characteristics of unburned islands and their role as potential refugia for the postfire population dynamics of wildlife species remain poorly understood.We used a newly developed unburned island database of the northwestern United States from 1984 to 2014 to assess the postfire response of the greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a large gallinaceous bird inhabiting the sagebrush ecosystems of North America, in which wildfires are common. Specifically, we tested whether prefire and postfire male attendance trends at mating locations (leks) differed between burned and unburned areas, and to what extent postfire habitat composition at multiple scales could explain such trends.Using time‐series of male counts at leks together with spatially explicit fire history information, we modeled whether male attendance was negatively affected by fire events. Results revealed that burned leks often exhibit sustained decline in male attendance, whereas leks within unburned islands or >1.5 km away from fire perimeters tend to show stable or increasing trends.Analyses of postfire habitat composition further revealed that sagebrush vegetation height within 0.8 km around leks, as well elevation within 0.8 km, 6.4 km, and 18 km around leks, had a positive effect on male attendance trends. Moreover, the proportion of the landscape with cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover >8% had negative effects on male attendance trends within 0.8 km, 6.4 km, and 18 km of leks, respectively.Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that maintaining areas of unburned vegetation within and outside fire perimeters may be crucial for sustaining sage‐grouse populations following wildfire. The role of unburned islands as fire refugia requires more attention in wildlife management and conservation planning because their creation, protection, and maintenance may positively affect wildlife population dynamics in fire‐prone ecosystems.

T1  - Estimating site occupancy and detectability of the threatened partridge pigeon (<i>Geophaps smithii</i>) using camera traps
AN  - 2260177287
AB  - Since European settlement, many granivorous birds of northern Australia's savanna landscapes have declined. One such example, the partridge pigeon (Geophaps smithii), has suffered a significant range contraction, disappearing from at least half of its pre‐European range. Multiple factors have been implicated in this decline, including the loss of traditional Aboriginal burning practices, grazing by large exotic herbivores and predation by feral cats (Felis catus). While populations of partridge pigeon on the Tiwi Islands may be particularly important for the long‐term persistence of this species, they too may be at risk of decline. However, as a reliable method to detect this species has not yet been developed and tested, we lack the ability to identify, at an early stage, the species' decline in a given location or region. This severely limits our capacity to make informed management decisions. Here, we demonstrate that the standard camera trapping approach for native mammal monitoring in northern Australia attained an overall probability of detecting partridge pigeon greater than 0.98. We thus provide a robust estimate of partridge pigeon site occupancy (0.30) on Melville Island, the larger of the two main Tiwi Islands. The information presented here for the partridge pigeon represents a critical first step towards the development of optimal monitoring programmes with which to gauge population trajectories, as well as the response to remedial management actions. In the face of ongoing biodiversity loss, such baseline information is vital for management agencies to make informed decisions and should therefore be sought for as many species as possible.

T1  - Spatio‐temporal gradients in food supply help explain the short‐term colonisation dynamics of the critically endangered central rock‐rat (<i>Zyzomys pedunculatus</i>)
AN  - 2260177273
AB  - Currently, the impact of introduced predators on small mammal population decline is a focal research direction in the Australian desert literature. In all likelihood though, single‐factor explanation of population dynamics is inadequate, leaving gaps in our knowledge of the multitude of potential influences on small mammal abundance and occupancy patterns in time and space. Here, we investigated floristic gradients across four potential refuge sites of the central rock‐rat, Zyzomys pedunculatus, a granivore rodent (50–120 g) that is endemic to central Australia and is categorised as critically endangered. The study took place in Tjoritja/West MacDonnell National Park in the MacDonnell Ranges bioregion. Floristic sampling was allocated across the four sites, the locations of which were predetermined by an established monitoring and management programme for the central rock‐rat. Our aim was to examine the relationship between environmental gradients and floristic composition across the four sites, and thereby test the extent to which the patterns of food type and food availability can inform central rock‐rat spatio‐temporal dynamics. We found high site‐scale floristic patterning that related foremost to elevation and then to antecedent rainfall and time‐since‐fire and fire‐severity effects. To interpret these results, we applied the principles of refuge theory and we described a gradient from core refuge habitat to intermittent and then marginal habitat within the current central rock‐rat stronghold area. Overall, our results implied a strong floristic basis to central rock‐rat site occurrence, and they thus compel us to take explicit account of spatial (elevation) and temporal (rainfall–productivity and fire‐disturbance) influences on the food axis of potential refuge sites of this critically endangered species.

T1  - Assessing soil compaction and micro-topography impacts of alternative heather cutting as compared to burning as part of grouse moor management on blanket bog
AN  - 2259979044
AB  - Background 
Over 25% of the UK land area is covered by uplands, the bulk of which are comprised of blanket bog. This not only contains most of the UK’s terrestrial carbon stocks, but also represents 15% of this globally rare habitat. About 30% of UK blanket bog is managed for red grouse by encouraging ling heather (Calluna vulgaris) with rotational burning, which has been linked to habitat degradation, with reduced carbon storage and negative impacts on water storage and quality. Alternative cutting is currently being pursued as a potential restoration management. However, the often used heavy cutting machinery could cause considerable compaction and damage to the peat surface. Two particular issues are (i) a potential increase in bulk density reducing water storage capacity (i.e., less pore volume and peat depth), and (ii) a possible reduction of the micro-topography due to cutting off the tops of hummocks (i.e., protruding clumps or tussocks of sedges).
 Methods 
We set up a fully replicated field experiment assessing cutting versus burn management impacts on peat physical and surface properties. Both managements reflected commonly used grouse moor management practice with cutting using heavy tractors fitted with load distributing double wheel and tracks (lowering ground pressure), whilst burning was done manually (setting heather areas alight with flame torches). We assessed management impacts on peat depth, bulk density and peat surface micro-topography which either included pre-management measurements or plot-level data for uncut plots. Total peat depth and bulk density in four 5 cm sections within the top 50 cm was assessed. Micro-topography was determined as the standard deviation of the height offsets measured over several plot transects in relation to the plot peat surface level at the start and end points of each transect.
 Results 
Despite an anticipated compaction from the heavy machinery used for cutting, the peat showed resilience and there was no lasting plot-level impact on either peat depth or bulk density. Notably, bulk density showed differences prior to, and thus unrelated to, management, and an overall increasing bulk density, even in uncut plots. However, cutting did reduce the plot micro-topography by about 2 cm, mostly due to removing the tops of hummocks, whereas burnt plots did not differ from uncut plots.
 Discussion 
Cutting is suggested as a suitable alternative to burning on grouse moors, although compaction issues might be site specific, depending on the nature of the peat, the machinery used and impacts at resting and turning points (which were not assessed). However, any observed bulk density differences could reflect natural changes in relation to changes in peat moisture, requiring adequate experimental comparisons. Moreover, where micro-topography is a priority, cutting equipment might need to consider the specific ground conditions, which could involve adjusting cutting height and the type of cutting machinery used.

T1  - Interactions among threats affect conservation management outcomes: Livestock grazing removes the benefits of fire management for small mammals in Australian tropical savannas
AN  - 2348242464
AB  - Conservation scientists and practitioners usually focus on understanding and managing individual threats to biodiversity. However, threats may interact, making management outcomes unpredictable. Here, we investigated whether interactions between fire regimes and introduced livestock affect the conservation goal of population recovery for small mammals in Australia's tropical savannas, using a long‐term and landscape‐scale study. Mammal richness and abundance increased as management reduced the average annual fire extent and frequency at large and medium scales. However, these relationships between fire and richness and abundance were only evident in areas where introduced livestock were removed. This interaction may arise because predation by feral cats is amplified in areas with reduced vegetation ground cover, and cover is reduced over longer periods when livestock have access to burnt areas, because they selectively graze regenerating grass. Fire management for conservation receives substantial investment across northern Australia, and in savannas worldwide; this study shows that without appropriate management of other factors, this investment may be ineffective. More broadly, managing single threats to biodiversity may be compromised if interactions between threats are not explicitly considered. This study provides an example of how such interactions can be evaluated for improved biodiversity conservation.

T1  - Contributions of fire refugia to resilient ponderosa pine and dry mixed‐conifer forest landscapes
AN  - 2266358937
AB  - Altered fire regimes can drive major and enduring compositional shifts or losses of forest ecosystems. In western North America, ponderosa pine and dry mixed‐conifer forest types appear increasingly vulnerable to uncharacteristically extensive, high‐severity wildfire. However, unburned or only lightly impacted forest stands that persist within burn mosaics—termed fire refugia—may serve as tree seed sources and promote landscape recovery. We sampled tree regeneration along gradients of fire refugia proximity and density at 686 sites within the perimeters of 12 large wildfires that occurred between 2000 and 2005 in the interior western United States. We used generalized linear mixed‐effects models to elucidate statistical relationships between tree regeneration and refugia pattern, including a new metric that incorporates patch proximity and proportional abundance. These relationships were then used to develop a spatially explicit landscape simulation model. We found that regeneration by ponderosa pine and obligate‐seeding mixed‐conifer tree species assemblages was strongly and positively predicted by refugia proximity and density. Simulation models revealed that for any given proportion of the landscape occupied by refugia, small patches produced greater landscape recovery than large patches. These results highlight the disproportionate importance of small, isolated islands of surviving trees, which may not be detectable with coarse‐scale satellite imagery. Findings also illustrate the interplay between patch‐scale resistance and landscape‐scale resilience: Disturbance‐resistant settings (fire refugia) can entrain resilience (forest regeneration) across the burn matrix. Implications and applications for land managers and conservation practitioners include strategies for the promotion and maintenance of fire refugia as components of resilient forest landscapes.

T1  - Using expressed behaviour of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to evaluate the vulnerability of upriver migrants under future hydrological regimes: Management implications and conservation planning
AN  - 2259006671
AB  - Globally, river systems have been extensively modified through alterations in riverscapes and flow regimes, reducing their capacity to absorb geophysical and environmental changes.In western North America and elsewhere, alterations in natural flow regimes and swimways through dams, levees, and floodplain development, work in concert with fire regime, forest management practices, as well as agriculture and urban development, to change recovery trajectories of river systems.Hydroregime scenarios for coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum, 1792), were investigated in Washington and Oregon, USA, where long‐term records of discharge, water temperature, and upstream fish passage are available. This novel approach combines hydrological and ecological data in a single visualization, providing empirical foundations for understanding upstream behavioural movement and tolerances of native fishes.The timing of coho salmon movement with respect to temperature and discharge were compared with scenarios representing possible future hydrological conditions associated with a changing climate.This approach provides a framework for the study of future hydrological alterations in other locations, and can inform local and regional conservation planning, particularly in view of water management policy. Management implications and recommendations for action that may expand the capacity of riverscapes to absorb perturbations are discussed.

T1  - Impacts of dead wood manipulation on the biodiversity of temperate and boreal forests. A systematic review
AN  - 2249674162
AB  - Dead wood (DW) provides critical habitat for thousands of species in forests, but its amount, quality and diversity have been heavily reduced by forestry. Therefore, interventions aiming to increase DW might be necessary to support its associated biodiversity, even in protected forests, which may be former production forests. Our aim was to synthesize the current state of knowledge drawn from replicated experimental studies into solid quantitative evidence of the effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity, with a focus on protected forests.We conducted a full systematic review of effects of DW manipulation on forest biodiversity in boreal and temperate regions. We included three intervention types: creation of DW from live trees at the site, addition of DW from outside the site and prescribed burning. Outcomes included abundance and species richness of saproxylic insects, ground insects, wood‐inhabiting fungi, lichens, reptiles and cavity‐nesting birds. In total, we included 91 studies, 37 of which were used in meta‐analyses.Although meta‐analysis outcomes were heterogeneous, they showed that increasing the amount of DW (“DW enrichment”) has positive effects on the abundance and richness of saproxylic insects and fungi. The positive effect on saproxylic pest insect abundance tended to be less than that on saproxylic insects in general. No significant effects were found for ground insects or cavity‐nesting birds.Although reviewed studies were mainly short term, our results support that management that increases DW amounts has the potential to increase the abundance of DW‐dependent species and, in most cases, also their species richness. Studies of burning showed positive effects on the abundance of saproxylic insects similar to those of other interventions, even though burning on average resulted in a smaller enrichment of DW amounts.Policy implications. The findings of the review suggest that manipulating dead wood (DW) can be an effective part of conservation management to support biodiversity in protected areas. The findings also indicate that the diversity of DW types is important, a mix of DW qualities should be favoured. Burning seems to be an effective method to increase biodiversity but to benefit cavity‐nesting birds, snag losses need to be minimized.Alternate abstract:SammanfattningDöd ved utgör ett viktigt habitat för tusentals skogslevande arter men mängden, kvaliteteten och dess diversitet har kraftigt minskat på grund av skogsbruket. Aktiva åtgärder som ökar mängden död ved kan därför bli nödvändigt för att förbättra situationen för arter kopplade till död ved. Dessa åtgärder kan även bli aktuella i skyddade skogar, varav många områden utgörs av skogar som har en historik av mänsklig påverkan. Vårt syfte med denna studie var att kvantitativt sammanfatta befintlig kunskap som handlar om död ved‐manipulation och dess inverkan på biodiversitet med huvudfokus på skyddade skogar.Vi har genomfört en komplett systematisk översiktssammanfattning om effekterna av död ved‐manipulation på biodoversiteten i tempererade och boreala skogar. Vi inkluderade tre typer av aktiva åtgärder: skapande eller adderande av död ved samt naturvårdsbränning. Vi inkluderade effekterna på förekomst och artmångfald av vedlevande insekter, marklevande insekter, vedlevande svampar, lavar, reptiler och hålhäckande fåglar. Vi hittade relevanta 91 studier och 37 av dessa användes i en meta‐analys.Resultaten från meta‐analysen visade på att en ökning av död ved hade en tydlig positiv effekt på både förekomst och artmångfald av vedlevande insekter och svampar. Förekomsten av vedlevande insekter som klassades som skadegörare ökade också men inte i samma utsträckning som vedlevande insekter totalt sett. Vi hittade ingen signifikant effekt på marklevande insekter eller hålhäckande fåglar.I de flesta studier som ingick i vår studie hade det gått endast en kort tid efter den aktiva åtgärden men resultaten visar ändå på att skötsel som ökar mängden död ved har potential att öka förekomst, samt i de flesta fall, även artförekomst, av arter kopplade till död ved. Även studierna som inkluderade naturvårdsbränning ökade förekomst av vedlevande insekter, trots att mängden död ved denna skötselmetod resulterade i var ungefär hälften jämfört med de övriga åtgärderna.Riktlinjer för praktiker: Denna studie visade på att åtgärder som ökar mängden död ved kan vara en effektiv naturvårdande skötselåtgärd som ökar biodiversiteten i skyddade skogar. Resultaten indikerar även att diversiteten av den döda veden är viktig och att en mix av kvalité bör gynnas. Naturvårdsbränning verkar vara en effektiv metod för att gynna biodiversitet men för att gynna hålhäckande fåglar bör torrakor skyddas.

T1  - An outback oasis: the ecological importance of bilby burrows
AN  - 2249639534
AB  - Ecosystem engineers are species that have a role in creating and maintaining certain habitat traits that are important for other species. Burrowing species do this by creating subterranean refugia from predation and thermal extremes, but also providing foraging opportunities through soil movement and by increasing local landscape heterogeneity. In this study, we used camera traps to monitor the burrows of greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis), a vulnerable Australian marsupial, in an area subject to frequent disturbance by fire. We tested the hypothesis that bilby burrows provide refuge for other species and therefore their presence increases biodiversity. In total, 45 taxa – 22 bird, 16 reptile and 7 mammal taxa – were recorded interacting with 127 burrows across 7 sites. Species richness was greater at burrows compared with vegetation away from burrows, while abundance was no different. There was no difference in species assemblage for bilby burrows that were actively maintained by bilbies compared with abandoned burrows, although there was more activity at bilby maintained burrows. A wildfire allowed us to test the ad hoc hypothesis that the use of bilby burrows was greater when vegetation cover was removed by fire. We recorded significant differences in species assemblage interacting with burrows after fire, although overall species richness and abundance did not change. The response of individual species was variable; for example, burrows provide a refuge for smaller species (such as mice and small reptiles), and may therefore protect them from the effects of fire. Where they persist, bilbies provide an important ecosystem engineering service, as their burrows support a broad range of species. Further reduction in the distribution of the bilby is therefore likely to have a flow‐on effect on biodiversity, impacting species that use their burrows for refuge.

T1  - Volume 72, Issue 3: Influences of Groundwater and Climatic Factors on Grassland in Xiliao River Plain, Northern China
AN  - 2239610153
AB  - The most sensitive areas to water depletion include arid and semiarid rangelands, where high intensity sunlight and warm temperatures can be combined with large amounts of groundwater to become some of the most productive cropland in the world.

In many cool season rangeland areas, winter and spring precipitation can increase soil moisture to near field capacity, and water declines in the soil profiles as the growing season progresses.

The serious overexploitation of groundwater makes it necessary to understand the influence of groundwater decline on grassland vegetation growth, especially in the context of climate change, which could compound the problem.

T1  - Divergent fire management leads to multiple beneficial outcomes for butterfly conservation in a production mosaic
AN  - 2233656138
AB  - Fire is an intrinsic component of many natural ecosystems. In human‐modified landscapes that occur in fire‐driven ecosystems, it can be difficult to make fire management decisions, as there must be a trade‐off between ideal conservation management and the practicalities of management in an altered landscape.We assess how biodiversity is influenced by differences in fire regime in a landscape fragmented by timber production. Here, optimal fire management for maintaining grassland integrity is not always possible, due to logistical constraints and fire risk to plantations. We investigate thicket establishment arising from reduced fire frequency, and how this affects butterfly diversity, assemblage structure, indicator species and species associations to larval host plants with different growth forms. Butterflies were sampled along a gradient of woodiness in large‐scale conservation corridors that separate timber compartments.The two extreme stages along the successional gradient, recently burned grassland and natural forests, supported relatively diverse and complementary butterfly assemblages. Grassland corridors without fire for 2 years were as high in butterfly diversity and similar in composition to recently burned grasslands. However, corridors without fire for >5 years were encroached by thicket and supported lower butterfly diversity. Thicket, with its intermediate vegetation character, was poor habitat for species adapted to either open grassland or to forests. Also, thicket‐encroached areas carry high fire risk to plantations.Synthesis and applications. In this fragmented, fire‐driven ecosystem, there is more than one burning strategy for achieving positive biodiversity outcomes. We recommend a divergent management approach that covers both extremes of the fire frequency continuum, with the choice depending on the stage of succession and management logistics for each site: (a) frequent burning to prevent woody encroachment in less‐encroached, logistically easier sites or (b) letting succession run its course through thicket to forest by excluding fire in heavily encroached, logistically challenging sites. Both options are practicable and maintain biotopes that have high value for butterfly conservation and low fire risk to plantations. This divergent management approach is a flexible strategy that benefits both conservation and commercial interests across fire‐prone plantation mosaics.

T1  - Advances in science and applications of air pollution monitoring: A case study on oil sands monitoring targeting ecosystem protection
AN  - 2232150971
AB  - The potential environmental impact of air pollutants emitted from the oil sands industry in Alberta, Canada, has received considerable attention. The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant's chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides [NOx], sulfur dioxide [SO2], volatile organic compounds [VOCs], particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 μm [PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg). This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region, in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components, in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts.Implications: Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation, particularly where uncertainties are the largest. Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure, both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments.

T1  - Spatiotemporal distribution dynamics of elephants in response to density, rainfall, rivers and fire in Kruger National Park, South Africa
AN  - 2227708178
AB  - AimAfrican elephants are ecosystem engineers. As such, their long‐term patterns of distribution and abundance (i.e., space‐use intensity) will influence ecosystem structure and function. We elucidate these patterns for bull versus herd groups, by analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of an increasing elephant population in relation to key ecological drivers: rainfall, distance to major rivers and time since last fire. Significant changes to the long‐term patterns of elephant density and group‐type probabilities are identified and explained.LocationKruger National Park, South Africa.MethodsUsing almost three decades of census records (1985–2012), we applied Multiple Point Process Models to assess the influence of rainfall, rivers and fire in shaping elephant space‐use. Significant changes to the long‐term patterns of elephant density and group type were also identified using kernel density estimates and the spatially varying probability of encountering either bull or herd group.ResultsBull and herd groups are no longer clearly segregated as available empty space becomes more limited. Bull and herd groups have dichotomous resource selection functions, in that bulls concentrate in areas receiving lower rainfall but more frequent fires while herds concentrate in higher rainfall areas experiencing less frequent fires. Both bull and herd groups concentrate closer to major rivers, emphasizing rivers as important spatial drivers. Overall, densities increased most significantly closer to rivers and in areas experiencing fewer fires. Fire was also a strong agent of group‐type change, as the probability of finding bulls, contrary to herds, significantly increased as fire return periods shortened.Main conclusionsElephant distribution and abundance patterns have homogenized in response to increased space limitations, with group‐specific, fire‐driven distribution patterns emerging overtime. Results herein should be used to help manage elephant space‐use through the establishment of possible refuge areas and the development of more empirical research into elephant impacts in future.

T1  - Passerine and secretive marsh bird responses to cattail management in temperate wetlands
AN  - 2193894624
AB  - Hybrid cattails (Typha x glauca) are an invasive, emergent aquatic plant that often form monodominant stands, which can alter wetland vegetation structure and negatively affect wildlife populations. Wetland managers often apply prescribed burning, grazing, and herbicide treatments to reduce cattail density but how these management actions influence wetland wildlife is largely unknown. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of hybrid cattail control methods on secretive marsh bird and wetland passerine abundance in central Minnesota, USA. Specifically, we assessed how environmental variables and cattail treatments (e.g., burning, grazing, and herbicide) influenced bird densities and community composition. We used the North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol to assess wetland bird communities across sixteen wetlands comprised of eight treatments with a full-factorial design. Species-specific density estimates and community-wide ordination offered little evidence for a substantial effect of treatments on marsh birds and passerines. However, gradients in vegetation height and mean biomass did have a significant relationship with both passerine and marsh bird community composition, which suggests changes in the bird community following cattail management might require time to develop. To support diverse wetland bird communities, treatments must create contrast among wetland habitats with high and low vegetative biomass. Because secretive marsh birds are under-surveyed, our baseline population estimates are valuable for future local and regional management and for gaining preliminary understanding of the effect of invasive species management on wetland birds in the Upper Midwest.

T1  - Refuges from fire maintain pollinator–plant interaction networks
AN  - 2250319470
AB  - Fire is a major disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems, leading to landscape transformation in fire‐prone areas. Species in mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are unclear. We use bipartite insect–flower interaction networks across a recently burned landscape to explore how plant–pollinator interaction networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level, and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower‐visiting insects during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of flower‐visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However, species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower‐rich fire refuges sustain plant–pollinator interactions, especially those involving specialized species, in fire‐disturbed landscape. This may be an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.

T1  - Seed moisture content as a primary trait regulating the lethal temperature thresholds of seeds
AN  - 2209792565
AB  - Fire has long shaped biological responses of plants and plant communities in many ecosystems; yet, uncontrolled wildfire frequently puts people and infrastructure at risk. Fuel or hazard reduction burning outside of the historic fire season is a common and widespread practice aimed at reducing the risk of high‐severity fires, which ideally also considers biodiversity values. Within fire‐prone systems, seed banks are critical for plant species’ regeneration, and seeds are typically adapted to survive the passage of fire and to regenerate in response to cues associated with historic fire regimes. However, species‐specific tolerances to the heat from fire exist; likely influenced by a range of physical, physiological, and morphological seed traits, which may differ between seasons. The identification of these tolerances and associated seed traits may inform fire and species management.We determined the lethal temperatures for seeds in relation to their moisture content, and other key traits that we hypothesised may be associated with survival. Seeds from 14 native species and 4 species non‐native to fire‐prone Mediterranean climate Banksia woodlands of south‐west Western Australia were exposed to temperatures between 50 and 180°C for 3 min at three different moisture contents. The temperature at which half the seeds were killed (T50) was estimated using nonlinear modelling. Seed mass, seed shape, embryo type, plant resprouting ability, seed storage syndrome, and native/non‐native status were quantified and modelled for their relationship with T50.Increased moisture content was a significant predictor of elevated seed mortality. Seeds with higher moisture (95% relative humidity [RH]) content perished at much lower temperatures. Seeds with low moisture content (15% or 50% RH) were able to survive significantly higher temperatures (median increase of 38 and 31°C higher respectively). Seeds with basal embryos showed significantly lower T50 than other embryo types.Synthesis. Seeds with elevated moisture contents have lower lethal temperature thresholds, leading to increased seed mortality during fire events when seeds (and soils) are moist. Thermal tolerance varied among coexisting species within this fire‐prone system. These data suggest potential concern for the impacts of aseasonal burning practices (i.e., cool/wet season burning), and highlight the importance of taking seed moisture content into account when planning and implementing prescribed burning.

T1  - All the eggs in one basket: Are island refuges securing an endangered passerine?
AN  - 2205244336
AB  - Refuges for threatened species are important to prevent species extinction. They provide protection from a range of environmental and biotic stressors, and ideally provide protection against all threatening processes. However, for some species it may not be clear why some areas are refuges and others are not. The forty‐spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus) is an endangered, sedentary, cryptic and specialised bird endemic to the island of Tasmania, Australia. Having undergone an extreme range contraction over the past century the species is now mostly confined to a few small offshore island refuges. Key threatening processes to the species include habitat loss, wildfire, competition and predation. The ways in which these processes have molded the species’ contemporary range have not been clearly evaluated. Furthermore, the security of the remnant population within refuges is uncertain. To overcome this uncertainty we assessed key threats and established the population status in known refuges by developing a robust survey protocol within an occupancy modelling framework. We discuss our results in the context of planning trial reintroductions of this endangered species in suitable habitat across its former range. We found very high occupancy rates (0.75–0.96) at two refuges and in suitable conditions, the species was highly detectable (p, 0.43–0.77). At a third location our surveys indicated a local extinction, likely due to recent wildfire. We demonstrate that all refuges are at high risk of one or more threatening processes and the current distribution across island refuges is unlikely to secure the species from extinction. We identified large areas of potential habitat across the species’ former mainland range, but these are likely too distant from source populations for natural recolonisation. We propose that establishing new populations of forty‐spotted pardalotes via reintroduction is essential to secure the species and that this is best achieved while robust source populations still exist.

T1  - Ashes to ashes: Intense fires extinguish populations of urban short‐range endemics
AN  - 2205243336
AB  - Native bushland fragmented by urbanization often experiences increased cover of flammable weeds, reduced biomass turnover and an absence of fuel management combined with increased ignitions. Depending on species’ mobility and dispersal traits, and the extent of burns within urban remnants, such fires may reduce individual survival rates or limit natural recolonization. We monitored the survival of mygalomorph spiders for a year following high‐intensity and low‐intensity fires in Banksia woodland remnants in urban Perth. Of the 257 burrows found, 115 spiders were confirmed to initially survive after intense wildfire, but none were confirmed alive after 12 months. In sharp contrast, only one spider from 103 observed burrows was confirmed dead after a low‐intensity prescribed fire. As there were instances of our monitored mygalomorphs relocating a short distance following only low intensity fires, we also tested whether predation rates were higher in burnt than unburnt areas. Higher rates of predation were found in burnt areas, but this was strongly influenced by both site and predator type. We recommend further consideration of low‐intensity prescribed fire as well as alternative fuel management approaches in urban remnants to better conserve mygalomorph spider populations and other taxa with limited dispersal and/or mobility capabilities.

T1  - Post-burn and long-term fire effects on plants and birds in floodplain wetlands of the Russian Far East
AN  - 2193894937
AB  - Wildfires affect biodiversity at multiple levels. While vegetation is directly changed by fire events, animals are often indirectly affected through changes in habitat and food availability. Globally, fire frequency and the extent of fires are predicted to increase in the future. The impact of fire on the biodiversity of temperate wetlands has gained little attention so far. We compared species richness and abundance of plants and birds in burnt and unburnt areas in the Amur floodplain/Russian Far East in the year of fire and 1 year after. We also analysed vegetation recovery in relation to time since fire over a period of 18 years. Plant species richness was higher in burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. This suggests that fire has a positive short-term effect on plant diversity. Bird species richness and abundance were lower on burnt compared to unburnt plots in the year of the fire, but not in the year after. Over a period of 18 years, high fire frequency led to an increase in herb cover and a decrease in grass cover. We show that the effects on biodiversity are taxon- and species-specific. Fire management strategies in temperate wetlands should consider fire frequency as a key driving force of vegetation structure, with carry-over effects on higher trophic levels. Designing fire “refuges”, i.e., areas that do not burn annually, might locally be necessary to maintain high species richness.

T1  - Propagule pressure and priority seeding effects on the demography of invasive annual and native perennial grass species
AN  - 2262593282
AB  - Background: Annual grass invasion and dominance creates a self-sustaining cycle that promotes wildfires and reduces forage abundance. Restoring native plant species to annual grass-invaded ecosystems is fundamental to fostering self-sustaining native plant communities.Aims: We sought to clarify varying restoration strategies on invasive annual and native perennial grass assembly, including strategically modified seeding times, seeding rates, and added water.Methods: We tested the effects of seeding perennial grasses in autumn, spring, or seeding half in autumn and the remaining half in spring, adding water, and varying annual and perennial grass seeding rates on annual and perennial grass life history.Results: While varying perennial grass seeding times did not affect perennial grass germination rates, annual grass germination rates were highest when perennial grasses were seeded in autumn. Seeding perennial grasses in spring produced the highest adult perennial grass density in the first-growing season, but adult perennial grass density in the second-growing season was greatest when seeding occurred in autumn. Second-growing season perennial grass density was highest where annual grass seeding rates were lowest and perennial grass seeding rates were highest. Adding water in the first-growing season produced almost two-times more second-year adult perennial grasses compared to where water was not added.Conclusions: High water availability during the seeding year appears to be the most important factor for retaining perennial grasses in annual grass-invaded ecosystems.

T1  - Grassland Bird and Butterfly Responses to Sericea Lespedeza Control via Late-Season Grazing Pressure
AN  - 2226384613
AB  - Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) is a high-tannin, late-season invasive forb species that reduces biodiversity in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. The largest tallgrass prairie remnant exists in the Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma, where the most common grazing management practice involves prescribed fire in early spring followed by intensive slocking with yearling beef cattle from April to July. Sericea has continued to spread under this management regime. From 2013 to 2016, in Kansas Flint Hills tallgrass prairie, we tested the effects of using spring burning with early-season steer grazing, followed by late-season sheep grazing (Steer+Sheep) compared to spring burning followed by steer grazing only (Steer) on sericea vigor, grassland birds, and pollinators. Density and nest success of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were not negatively affected by Steer+Sheep relative to Steer treatments, whereas there was evidence of a negative effect in these same metrics for Dickcissels (Spiza americana). Abundance of butterflies and their nectar sources were similar between treatments but abundance of grassland specialist butterfly species was low, overall. Comprehensively, Steer+Sheep effectively controls the spread of sericea but may not create habitat for all tallgrass prairie wildlife species.

T1  - Evaluating support for rangeland‐restoration practices by rural Somalis: an unlikely win‐win for local livelihoods and hirola antelope?
AN  - 2205124521
AB  - In developing countries, governments often lack the authority and resources to implement conservation outside of protected areas. In such situations, the integration of conservation with local livelihoods is crucial to species recovery and reintroduction efforts. The hirola Beatragus hunteri is the world's most endangered antelope, with a population of <500 individuals that is restricted to <5% of its historical geographic range on the Kenya–Somali border. Long‐term hirola declines have been attributed to a combination of disease and rangeland degradation. Tree encroachment—driven by some combination of extirpation of elephants, overgrazing by livestock, and perhaps fire suppression—is at least partly responsible for habitat loss and the decline of contemporary populations. Through interviews in local communities across the hirola's current range, we identified socially acceptable strategies for habitat restoration and hirola recovery. We used classification and regression trees, conditional inference trees, and generalized linear models to identify sociodemographic predictors of support for range‐restoration strategies. Locals supported efforts to conserve elephants (which kill trees and thus facilitate grass growth), seed and fertilize grass, and remove trees, but were opposed to livestock reduction. Locals were ambivalent toward controlled burns and soil ripping (a practice through which soil is broken up to prevent compaction). Livestock ownership and years of residency were key predictors of locals’ perceptions toward rangeland‐restoration practices. Locals owning few livestock were more supportive of elephant conservation, and seeding and fertilization of grass, while longer term residents were more supportive of livestock reduction but were less supportive of elephant conservation. Ultimately, wildlife conservation outside protected areas requires long‐term, community‐based efforts that are compatible with human livelihoods. We recommend elephant conservation, grass seeding and fertilization, manual tree removal and resting range from livestock both to enhance the potential for hirola recovery and to build positive rapport with local communities in the geographic range of this critically endangered species.

T1  - Influences of long-term changes in land cover on mammal populations: an example from Mexico
AN  - 2199076654
AB  - Changes in vegetative cover and land use in the southern part of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, were identified by analysing satellite images from 2001 and 2014. Fluctuations in population density of mammal species during 2001–2016 in response to these changes were analysed. During 2001–2014 the types of land use that increased in area (per year) were prescribed burning (uncontrolled burning caused by humans) by 105.11 ha, seasonal agricultural plots by 58.14 ha, areas without vegetation by 24.54 ha, and human settlements by 4.13 ha. In the same period, savannahs decreased by 103.94 ha, tropical dry forest by 39.5 ha, secondary forests by 14.46 ha, and human-induced grassland by 0.13 ha per year. The loss of these habitats resulted in low population densities of mammals, including the eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus and the Tehuantepec jackrabbit Lepus flavigularis, which is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. We recommend establishing a communal ecological reserve in the study area to implement appropriate management strategies for grassland communities and develop a programme of semi-captive breeding to conserve L. flavigularis.

T1  - Optimizing reproductive opportunity for Florida grasshopper sparrows: When to burn?
AN  - 2194680555
AB  - The critically endangered Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus) is dependent on dry prairies managed with prescribed fires that are applied every 1–3 years. Timing of prescribed fires shifted from predominantly the dormant season (Jan–Mar) to the transition (Apr–Jun) and growing (Jul–Aug) seasons starting in the early 2000s to better mimic natural fire regimes. Populations have continued to decline, however, and the presumption that natural fire regimes are beneficial to the small extant Florida grasshopper sparrow populations needs to be evaluated. We monitored 167 Florida grasshopper sparrow nests across 6 fire treatments at Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area, Osceola County, Florida, USA, 2013–2016, and investigated the role of fire season and interval on clutch initiation date, nest site selection, nest survival, productivity, and nestling mass. Clutch initiation was delayed by ≥33 days in prairies burned during the current transition season and we found no nests in prairies burned during the current growing season. Transition season burns also overlapped with the early breeding season, which could result in the destruction of nests. Clutches were larger at the beginning of the breeding season and nestling mass was highest in the middle of the breeding season, indicating that early and mid‐season nests may be more valuable to annual fecundity than late‐season nests. Florida grasshopper sparrows nested in prairies burned in the current dormant season or previous growing season more than expected based on their availability and as expected or less than expected in prairies burned in the current transition season, previous transition season, previous dormant season, or >2 years ago. However, we found no effect of fire treatment on daily nest survival, clutch size, number of fledglings per successful nest, or nestling mass. We recommend dormant season burning in prairies occupied by Florida grasshopper sparrows to increase reproductive potential given the subspecies’ small population and the importance of each nest attempt to population growth. We recommend transition or growing season burns in unoccupied adjacent prairies to maintain high‐quality dry prairie for nesting in future years. Prescribed fire management goals for Florida grasshopper sparrow populations should be guided by demographic responses rather than natural fire regimes. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Pockets of resistance: Response of arid‐land fish communities to climate, hydrology, and wildfire
AN  - 2190830371
AB  - Disturbance regimes of arid regions throughout the world are changing along with global warming. Severity of drought associated with decreased stream discharge and increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are increasing in many of these systems. Combined, these factors can have potentially devastating effects on stream fish communities.To quantify the response of fish communities to annual variation in climate, hydrology, and wildfire, we used long‐term and spatially extensive datasets from the Gila River drainage, NM, U.S.A. Additionally, we tracked the recovery of multiple fish communities within the study area following extreme drought and associated wildfires that occurred between 2011 and 2013.Twenty‐nine years of monitoring at six sites, beginning in 1988, indicated that fish community richness and density were negatively associated with drought, as quantified by the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Ordination of fish species densities across these sites further suggested that native species were more sensitive to inter‐annual variation in climate than non‐native fishes.The resistance and resilience of fishes to drought and ash flows following the most severe series of wildfires on record between 2011 and 2013 were highly variable across sites and species. The percent of common species that were able to resist a significant decline ranged from 0 to 70%, depending on location. As of 2017, all but two species (one native and one non‐native) had recovered at one or more sites.Although we hypothesised that the response to wildfire and drought that occurred between 2011 and 2013 should vary with body size and species provenance (native or non‐native), this was not supported. Rather, resistance of fish communities to these events appeared to be driven primarily by spatial factors, such as intensity of disturbance, and resilience was driven by species ability to rapidly rebound from severely depressed numbers or immigrate from nearby refuge populations.Current climate trends suggest an increase in the intensity of disturbance associated with wildfire and drought; thus, maintenance of native biodiversity should focus on preservation of habitat integrity and connectivity among habitats that allows for recolonisation of disturbed habitats.

T1  - Resilience and restoration of tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and grassy woodlands
AN  - 2190287971
AB  - Despite growing recognition of the conservation values of grassy biomes, our understanding of how to maintain and restore biodiverse tropical grasslands (including savannas and open‐canopy grassy woodlands) remains limited. To incorporate grasslands into large‐scale restoration efforts, we synthesised existing ecological knowledge of tropical grassland resilience and approaches to plant community restoration. Tropical grassland plant communities are resilient to, and often dependent on, the endogenous disturbances with which they evolved – frequent fires and native megafaunal herbivory. In stark contrast, tropical grasslands are extremely vulnerable to human‐caused exogenous disturbances, particularly those that alter soils and destroy belowground biomass (e.g. tillage agriculture, surface mining); tropical grassland restoration after severe soil disturbances is expensive and rarely achieves management targets. Where grasslands have been degraded by altered disturbance regimes (e.g. fire exclusion), exotic plant invasions, or afforestation, restoration efforts can recreate vegetation structure (i.e. historical tree density and herbaceous ground cover), but species‐diverse plant communities, including endemic species, are slow to recover. Complicating plant‐community restoration efforts, many tropical grassland species, particularly those that invest in underground storage organs, are difficult to propagate and re‐establish. To guide restoration decisions, we draw on the old‐growth grassland concept, the novel ecosystem concept, and theory regarding tree cover along resource gradients in savannas to propose a conceptual framework that classifies tropical grasslands into three broad ecosystem states. These states are: (1) old‐growth grasslands (i.e. ancient, biodiverse grassy ecosystems), where management should focus on the maintenance of disturbance regimes; (2) hybrid grasslands, where restoration should emphasise a return towards the old‐growth state; and (3) novel ecosystems, where the magnitude of environmental change (i.e. a shift to an alternative ecosystem state) or the socioecological context preclude a return to historical conditions.

T1  - Combining optimization and simulation modelling to measure the cumulative impacts of prescribed fire and wildfire on vegetation species diversity
AN  - 2186930113
AB  - Growth‐stage optimization (GSO) offers a new approach to biodiversity conservation in fire‐prone regions by estimating the optimal distribution of vegetation growth stages that maximize a species diversity index. This optimal growth‐stage structure provides managers an operational goal explicitly linked to a positive conservation outcome but does not define the fire regime needed to achieve it.We paired GSO with LANDIS II, a landscape succession and disturbance simulation model, to (a) estimate the optimal growth‐stage structure that maximized vegetation diversity in a south‐east Australian heathy woodland, (b) define the fire regime needed to achieve it, and (c) determine the cumulative effects of different fire‐regime scenarios on vegetation diversity over a 60‐year period. Scenarios included 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of the landscape burnt per year by prescribed fire only, or in combination with three alternative wildfire regimes. Furthermore, we investigated the differences in the optimal growth‐stage structure relating to above‐ground, soil seedbank, and total (above and soil seedbank) diversity datasets.The growth‐stage structure that maximized total vegetation diversity comprised approximately even proportions of all stages. In contrast, separately analysed above‐ground and soil seedbank data resulted in a greater proportion of younger and older growth‐stages, respectively.Scenarios including 5% prescribed burning per year (with and without wildfire) resulted in diversity values within 1.5% of the theoretical maximum value. Scenarios including 2% and 10% prescribed fire resulted in diversity values 8%–12% and 1.5%–5% lower than the maximum, respectively. Scenarios without prescribed fire caused diversity to fall 30%–70%. Trends across the 60 years showed that wildfire depressed diversity and subsequent prescribed fire drove recovery within 15 years. The largest threat to vegetation diversity was the absence of fire.Synthesis and applications. Combining growth‐stage optimization and simulation modelling is a powerful way of defining a conservation‐based fire management goal and identifying the prescribed fire regime needed to achieve it. We demonstrated that vegetation diversity in heathy woodland was increased by prescribed fire, with and without the cumulative effect of wildfire, and declined sharply when fire was excluded. Our method provides a flexible platform for developing long‐term fire management strategies that seek to balance human safety and biodiversity conservation. Including both plants and animals in GSO will help land managers meet the needs of multiple taxa.

T1  - Increases in heat-induced tree mortality could drive reductions of biomass resources in Canada’s managed boreal forest
AN  - 2188502620
AB  - ContextThe Canadian boreal forest provides valuable ecosystem services that are regionally and globally significant. Despite its importance, the future of the Canadian boreal forest is highly uncertain because potential impacts of future climate change on ecosystem processes and biomass stocks are poorly understood.ObjectivesWe investigate how anticipated climatic changes in coming decades could trigger abrupt changes in the biomass of dominant species in Canada’s boreal forests.MethodsUsing the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-LMfire, which was parameterized for the dominant tree genera in Canada’s boreal forests (Picea, Abies, Pinus, Populus) and driven by a large range of climate scenarios grouped by two forcing scenarios (RCP 4.5/8.5), we simulated forest composition, biomass, and the frequency of disturbance, including wildfire, from Manitoba to Newfoundland.ResultsResults suggest that responses of this region to a warmer future climate will be very important, especially in southern boreal areas and under the RCP 8.5 forcing scenario. In these areas, reductions of total aboveground biomass incurred by fire and heat-induced tree mortality events are projected; the fertilizing effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 on forest productivity is unlikely to compensate for these losses. Decreases in total forest stocks would likely be associated with forest cover loss and a shift in composition in particular from needleleaf evergreen (softwood) to broadleaf deciduous (hardwood) taxa.ConclusionThe simulated future reduction in softwood biomass suggests that forest management strategies will have to be adapted to maintain a sustainable level of forest harvest and tree density that meets demands for wood products, while maintaining other ecosystem services.

T1  - Spotted owl foraging patterns following fuels treatments, Sierra Nevada, California
AN  - 2166620094
AB  - Western dry conifer forests continue to experience increased severe, stand‐replacing wildfire that is outside of historical precedent. Fuels treatments, landscape‐scale modifications of forest fuels and structure, are likely to remain a management tool to modify fire behavior and restore ecological resilience. The impacts of fuels treatments to listed species such as spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) remain uncertain and are contested because of limited available information. To evaluate spotted owl foraging habitat selection in a landscape recently modified by forest fuels‐reduction treatments, we radio‐marked and tracked 10 California spotted owls (S. o. occidentalis) for 2 years immediately following fuels treatment installation in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We categorized fuels treatments into 3 types: mechanical thin, installed within the study area as landscape‐scale fire breaks characterized by even tree spacing, open understory, and low canopy cover, or group selections; understory thin, a hand‐removal of small trees and shrubs; and understory thin followed by underburn, a controlled surface‐fuel burn that left the overstory intact. We described post‐treatment habitat using forest structural metrics derived from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset that was collected 1 year after fuels treatments were completed. We collected 436 spotted owl foraging locations during 2 breeding seasons and evaluated breeding season home range size and composition using a resource selection function. We assessed possible contributors to owl foraging patterns by comparing a priori hypotheses in an information‐theoretic approach and using randomly generated points that estimated available habitat. Spotted owl breeding season home ranges contained fuels treatments in proportion to their availability on the landscape and averaged 17.1% treated area. Within the home range, owl foraging locations in the post‐treatment landscape were best predicted by lower proportions of gaps than anticipated at random, steeper slopes, and minimized distance from the owl's site center. Our results suggest that moderate to high proportions of gaps, typically a feature of forest fuels reduction and restoration treatments, may reduce the probability of spotted owl foraging. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - The Impacts of Prescribed Fire on PM<sub>2.5</sub> Air Quality and Human Health: Application to Asthma-Related Emergency Room Visits in Georgia, USA
AN  - 2329435954
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is a major component of air pollution that comes from both primary (e.g., dust, biomass burning, coal-fired power plant) and secondary (e.g., reactions of chemicals emitted from primary sources) sources [2].

Prescribed burning, another type of biomass burning, is a land management practice used to improve native vegetation and wildlife habitat, control insects and disease, and reduce wildfire risk [9].

[...]we employed a general health impact function to estimate the impacts of prescribed burning on asthma-related ER visits in Georgia during the first four months of 2015–2018.

Health Impact Function We used a log-linear relationship between air pollutant concentration change and health outcome incidence to quantify the health impact from prescribed burning as follows: ΔY= Y0(1−e−βΔPM)×Pop where Y0 is the baseline incidence rate for the health endpoint, β is the health effect estimate from the epidemiological study, ΔPM is the change in air pollutant concentration, and Pop is the population exposed to the air pollution [23].

T1  - Satellite-Based Assessment of Grassland Conversion and Related Fire Disturbance in the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska
AN  - 2303983627
AB  - Spruce beetle-induced (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby)) mortality on the Kenai Peninsula has been hypothesized by local ecologists to result in the conversion of forest to grassland and subsequent increased fire danger. This hypothesis stands in contrast to empirical studies in the continental US which suggested that beetle mortality has only a negligible effect on fire danger. In response, we conducted a study using Landsat data and modeling techniques to map land cover change in the Kenai Peninsula and to integrate change maps with other geospatial data to predictively map fire danger for the same region. We collected Landsat imagery to map land cover change at roughly five-year intervals following a severe, mid-1990s beetle infestation to the present. Land cover classification was performed at each time step and used to quantify grassland encroachment patterns over time. The maps of land cover change along with digital elevation models (DEMs), temperature, and historical fire data were used to map and assess wildfire danger across the study area. Results indicate the highest wildfire danger tended to occur in herbaceous and black spruce land cover types, suggesting that the relationship between spruce beetle damage and wildfire danger in costal Alaskan forested ecosystems differs from the relationship between the two in the forests of the coterminous United States. These change detection analyses and fire danger predictions provide the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KENWR) ecologists and other forest managers a better understanding of the extent and magnitude of grassland conversion and subsequent change in fire danger following the 1990s spruce beetle outbreak.

T1  - Pyrogenic flowering of Aristida beyrichiana following 50&#xa0;years of fire exclusion
AN  - 2290594618
AB  - Fire‐stimulated or pyrogenic flowering is one of many traits that enable plants in fire‐prone ecosystems to persist or dominate following frequent fires. Obligate pyrogenic flowering has long been observed in wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana), a foundation bunchgrass in frequently burned longleaf pine ecosystems in the southeastern United States. Widespread fire exclusion in this ecosystem has contributed to well‐documented declines in plant and animal biodiversity prompting the need for restoration efforts. We studied the effect of fire reintroduction on the flowering of wiregrass in northern Florida, USA. Prescribed fires were ignited in a 50‐yr unburned site and an adjacent frequently burned site in the summer of 2017. Wiregrass was measured eight months after the burns in both stands. As expected, the frequently burned stand had higher density, basal area, and percent flowering of wiregrass tussocks. Logistic regression revealed that wiregrass initiated flowering at significantly larger sizes in the long‐unburned stand. Despite these differences, wiregrass size distributions were similar in both stands, with the long‐unburned stand lacking tussocks in the largest (100+ cm2) size class. We did not find differences in the number of flower culms per unit of mass between the two stands. Even though diminished in nearly every measure, the ability of wiregrass to flower after five decades of fire exclusion, and presumably no sexual reproduction, provides evidence of resilience of the dominant herb of these ecosystems.

T1  - Asian needle ant ( Brachyponera chinensis ) and woodland ant responses to repeated applications of fuel reduction methods
AN  - 2290590178
AB  - Ants (Formicidae: Hymenoptera) are important components of forest ecosystems and can be affected by fuel reduction forest management practices. We assessed the impact of repeated applications of fuel reduction treatments on abundance and diversity of ants within upland mixed‐hardwood forests in the Southern Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (~56 ha each) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments, which included prescribed burning (B), mechanical felling (M), a combination of prescribed burning and mechanical felling (MB), and a control (C; i.e., no treatment). We implemented treatments multiple times (two mechanical thinnings and four prescribed burns) over the course of a 15‐yr period. Due to tree mortality and resultant canopy gaps from high‐severity burns, forest structure was dramatically altered in MB. Over a 3‐yr period (2014–2016), we captured 54,219 ants comprised of 23 genera using pitfall and colored pan traps. Prenolepis imparis was the most common ant species collected, and it was significantly lower in abundance in MB than all other treatments. However, the non‐native species Brachyponera chinensis was more abundant in MB than all other treatments. Thus, some fuel reduction treatments may have consequences for invasive ant colonization in forests. Most ant taxa did not differ in abundance among treatments, suggesting that some fuel reduction practices may affect some, but not all ant species. Our results indicate that some fuel reduction treatments can alter forest ant communities, thus contributing to changing forest ecosystem dynamics. Monitoring of ants and other bioindicators after repeated rounds of fuel reduction treatments could provide useful knowledge that can be used to help balance forest management and biological diversity.

T1  - Physiological stress levels in wild koala sub-populations facing anthropogenic induced environmental trauma and disease
AN  - 2210008296
AB  - Australian small mammals such as koalas must cope with immense pressure from anthropogenic induced stressors or trauma such as bushfires, vehicle collision impacts and habitat disturbance and land clearance. In addition, they must cope with diseases such as chlamydia. To date, there is no published literature on physiological stress levels in wild koala populations compared with identified environmental stressors. This study investigated physiological stress levels within sub-populations of wild koalas encountering environmental trauma and disease from New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA). Physiological stress was determined using a faecal glucocorticoid (or cortisol) metabolites (FGMs) enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) from 291 fresh faecal samples collected from wild koalas at the point of rescue. A healthy breeding sub-population from a forest reserve in QLD acted as a control group. Clearance of prime Eucalyptus habitat had the largest impact on FGMs, followed by bushfire related factors (e.g. flat demeanour, dehydration and burns injury). Koalas with other sources of physical injury (dog-attacks and vehicle collisions) and disease (chlamydia) also had higher FGMs compared to healthy wild koalas. Healthy wild koalas expressed the lowest median levels of FGMs. Overall, the results highlight that anthropogenic-induced stressors tend to increase physiological stress in wild koalas. Thus, the ultimate stressors such as habitat clearance and bush fire events could increase the incidences of proximate stressors such as dog attacks and vehicle collisions, and increase risks of foliage shortage, diseases and mortality. Therefore, there is need for ecological monitoring, conservation management actions and policy changes to curb the koala population crisis, especially within on-going and future land and road development programs.

T1  - Recalling open old growth forests in the Southeastern Mixed Forest province of the United States
AN  - 2186068805
AB  - Historical forests in the Southeastern Mixed Forest province of the United States have been less researched than other regions using historical tree surveys. We used 81,000 tree records from surveys during the 1800s to quantify composition of this ecological province. Upland oaks and pines comprised about 75% of all trees, with relatively equal composition. Oak composition may have comprised > 45% to the northern and eastern sides of the province. Hickories were about 10% of composition and a few species were present at 1% to 2% composition. Currently, pine has increased to 49% composition; loblolly pine was 46% of all trees. Upland oaks decreased to 8% composition. Paralleling other historically oak- or pinedominated regions, fire-intolerant species increased to 40% of composition, particularly early-successional sweetgum. Historical oak-pine forests mostly have converted to loblolly pine plantations and broadleaf forests in this region. A large extent of the eastern United States historically was dominated by oak or pine forests, which likely were open old growth forests due to a frequent, low-to-moderate severity fire regime that reduced tree densities and infrequently disturbed overstory trees. Open old growth forests should be recognized as distinct ecosystems with unique characteristics, ecological functioning, and associated management practices.Alternate abstract:Les relevés historiques d'arbres ont été moins utilises pour étudier les forets mixtes du sudest des États-Unis que les forets d'autres provinces écologiques. Nous avons utilisé 81 000 mentions d'arbres provenant de relevés du XIXe siécle pour quantifier la composition de cette province écologique. Les chénes de milieux secs et les pins représentaient environ 75% de tous les arbres, en proportions relativement égales. La composition en chénes pouvait étre > 45% au nord et â l'est de la province. Les caryers représentaient environ 10% de la composition et quelques espéces étaient présentes â 1-2%. Présentement, les pins ont augmenté â 49%; le pin â encens représentant 46% de tous les arbres. Les chénes de milieux secs ont diminué â 8%. Comme dans d'autres régions historiquement dominées par les chénes et les pins, les espéces tolérantes au feu ont augmenté â 40%, particuliérement le copalme (espéce pionniére). Les foréts historiques de chénes et de pins ont surtout été converties en plantations de pin â encens et en foréts feuillues. Une large part de l'est des États-Unis était historiquement dominée par des foréts de chénes et de pins, probablement des peuplements ouverts et ágés dus â un régime de feux fréquents et de sévérité faible â modérée qui réduisait la densité d'arbres et perturbait rarement les arbres de l'étage dominant. Les foréts ouvertes et ágées devraient étre reconnues comme des écosystémes distincts avec des caractéristiques, un fonctionnement écologique et des pratiques d'aménagement uniques.

T1  - Partitioning drivers of spatial genetic variation for a continuously distributed population of boreal caribou: Implications for management unit delineation
AN  - 2169269841
AB  - Isolation by distance (IBD) is a natural pattern not readily incorporated into theoretical models nor traditional metrics for differentiating populations, although clinal genetic differentiation can be characteristic of many wildlife species. Landscape features can also drive population structure additive to baseline IBD resulting in differentiation through isolation‐by‐resistance (IBR). We assessed the population genetic structure of boreal caribou across western Canada using nonspatial (STRUCTURE) and spatial (MEMGENE) clustering methods and investigated the relative contribution of IBD and IBR on genetic variation of 1,221 boreal caribou multilocus genotypes across western Canada. We further introduced a novel approach to compare the partitioning of individuals into management units (MU) and assessed levels of genetic connectivity under different MU scenarios. STRUCTURE delineated five genetic clusters while MEMGENE identified finer‐scale differentiation across the study area. IBD was significant and did not differ for males and females both across and among detected genetic clusters. MEMGENE landscape analysis further quantified the proportion of genetic variation contributed by IBD and IBR patterns, allowing for the relative importance of spatial drivers, including roads, water bodies, and wildfires, to be assessed and incorporated into the characterization of population structure for the delineation of MUs. Local population units, as currently delineated in the boreal caribou recovery strategy, do not capture the genetic variation and connectivity of the ecotype across the study area. Here, we provide the tools to assess fine‐scale spatial patterns of genetic variation, partition drivers of genetic variation, and evaluate the best management options for maintaining genetic connectivity. Our approach is highly relevant to vagile wildlife species that are of management and conservation concern and demonstrate varying degrees of IBD and IBR with clinal spatial genetic structure that challenges the delineation of discrete population boundaries.

T1  - Variable retention harvesting in Victoria’s Mountain Ash (<i>Eucalyptus regnans</i>) forests (southeastern Australia)
AN  - 2167565684
AB  - Variable retention harvesting is a silvicultural system that focuses on retaining key elements of stand structure at the time of logging and is increasingly being used worldwide. We describe the design and establishment of a variable retention harvesting experiment established in the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The experiment was instigated in 2003, and the work to date has shown that it has environmental benefits for certain groups of small mammals, birds, and vascular plants. The experiment has been integrated with an ongoing long-term monitoring program as well as other experiments such as those in post-fire salvage-logged areas. Collectively, the results of various studies suggest that the potential value of variable retention harvesting extends beyond green-tree logging to post-fire salvage logging environments.We outline some of the challenges in, and new perspectives derived from, implementing and maintaining our experiment. This included difficulties protecting islands from high-intensity post-harvest regeneration burns and threat of declining funding undermining ongoing project viability. A critically important perspective concerns the ecological and economic context in which variable retention harvesting is implemented. In the particular case of Mountain Ash forests, assessments using formal IUCN criteria classify the ecosystem as being Critically Endangered under the Red Listed Ecosystem approach. As a result, Mountain Ash forests are at a high risk of ecosystem collapse. Further logging will increase that risk, making the basis for continued harvesting questionable. In addition, economic analyses suggest that the value of natural assets, like water production, far outweigh the value of the wood products harvested from the Mountain Ash ecosystem, again leading to questions about the viability of ongoing harvesting. We therefore conclude that whilst variable retention harvesting has the potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in Mountain Ash forests, broader ecological and economic contextual issues (such as the values of competing resources like water yields and the heavily degraded state of the forest) may erode the case for its broader application.

T1  - Barriers to natural regeneration in temperate forests across the USA
AN  - 2159929999
AB  - For millennia, natural disturbance regimes, including anthropogenic fire and hunting practices, have led to forest regeneration patterns that created a diversity of forest lands across the USA. But dramatic changes in climates, invasive species, and human population, and land use have created novel disturbance regimes that are causing challenges to securing desired natural regeneration. Climate is an ever-present background disturbance and determinant of species distribution. Changes in certain other factors such as large herbivore populations, wildfire, and pests modify forest composition and structure, and are common barriers to natural regeneration of desired species. Changes in long-standing disturbance regimes have led to the homogenization of forest landscape composition and structure. Today, forests have low regeneration potential and are low in resilience. They have reduced productivity and are prone to widespread health issues including severe forest mortality. In addition to epidemics of native invasive species due to climate change and availability of habitat at landscape scales, the continued introduction and spread of non-native pests and diseases are causing large-scale forest mortality. These ecological changes have cascading ecological consequences such as increases in severe wildfire, which pose new barriers to natural regeneration. Equally challenging are the barriers to natural regeneration that arise from social, political and economic factors. To address many of these issues requires active management that links all critical stages in the regeneration niche necessary for achieving desired regeneration to sustain forest development and production in a socially acceptable manner and economically viable market system.

T1  - Land management alters traditional nutritional benefits of migration for elk
AN  - 2157922138
AB  - Ungulates typically migrate to maximize nutritional intake when forage varies seasonally. In western North America, however, increasing numbers of ungulates reside on low‐elevation winter range year‐round rather than migrating. These residents often occupy irrigated agricultural areas, but it is not known whether the nutrition provided by agricultural land exceeds that gained by migration. We evaluated the nutrition available to a partially migratory population of elk (Cervus canadensis) in west‐central Montana where some individuals summered on low‐elevation agricultural lands, whereas others summered on traditional higher‐elevation ranges. We sampled elk forage plants from ground plots and adult female elk movements from global positioning system (GPS) collar locations during late summer for 2 years. We tested for differences in the nutrition provided by 11 vegetative communities commonly available to elk in the Rocky Mountains and the nutrition available in areas used by individuals whose behaviors ranged from residency to migration. We found the nutrition available to elk decreased along the continuum from resident to migratory behavior, contrary to our hypothesis that all behaviors would provide access to equivalent forage quality. The relatively small summer home ranges of migrants suggest other factors (e.g., decreased competition) may compensate for their lower nutritional value, because the size of a home range is often inversely related to its fitness benefits. We found irrigated agriculture provided the highest forage quality in low elevations, but recently burned (1–6 yr prior) dry forests at higher elevations provided forage quality approximately equivalent to that of irrigated agriculture. Excluding elk from irrigated agricultural areas should therefore reduce nutritional incentives for elk to reside at low elevations year‐round. Additionally, fire in higher‐elevation dry forests may temporarily increase forage quality for elk and improve nutritional benefits of migratory behavior. Our results indicate land management practices can affect nutritionally mediated fitness benefits of differing behaviors in partially migratory populations of ungulates. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Fire regimes and shifting community patterns: a case study and method for species with complex fire requirements
AN  - 2136319742
AB  - Anthropogenic alteration of fire regimes is implicated in the extinction or decline of species across the globe. Active management of fire regimes using specified guidelines can help sustain diversity and counter this loss. However, some species occur across multiple communities with differing fire regime requirements or may exploit the dynamics of associated ecotones. These complexities are not easily understood via a simple consideration of life history traits or unravelled by a simple experimental framework. Population modelling, however, may provide valuable insights in these instances, but to date this remains unexplored. A population model based on detailed demographic, habitat and fire regime data was developed for the species Prostanthera askania. The species occurs across rainforest/eucalypt forest ecotones subject to long-term alteration, fragmentation and invasion by exotic species. Modelling revealed that current recommended fire guidelines will not sustain this species under these novel conditions. Fire regimes that minimised extinction risk in some scenarios had double or five times the fire frequencies of recommended regimes. Managing fire was also more important in specific habitat (gully habitat rather than on slopes or ridges). Currently applied management actions for Prostanthera askania do not include any fire management and the regimes that apply to most habitat in which the species occurs (no fire or fire at up to 50-year intervals in gully habitat) is not optimal for the species. Management will be substantially more effective if specific fire treatments revealed by this study are employed (e.g. fire intervals of 20–30 years in gully habitat). The study demonstrates that a conceptualisation and consideration of communities as both temporally and spatially dynamic can substantially contribute to better fire management outcomes. The approach used herein can be readily adapted and applied to a plethora of species via a range of software packages and codes.

T1  - Navigating fragmented landscapes: Canada lynx brave poor quality habitats while traveling
AN  - 2154241980
AB  - Anthropogenic and natural habitat fragmentation inhibit movement of animals through landscapes. An important challenge for connectivity conservation is determining which conditions facilitate or limit movements, so that these areas can be prioritized for protection or restoration. We examine Canada lynx Lynx canadensis habitat connectivity in the fragmented North Cascade Mountains of Washington, as an example of a highly mobile species that is specialized both on prey and in habitat needs. We identify lynx Habitat Concentration Areas based on Core Habitat Models, parameterize resistance surfaces from our Matrix Habitat Model, and develop linkages of habitat lynx use to move between patches of high quality habitat. We identify a number of linkages for lynx comprised of habitat conditions that differed from high quality core patches identified from our habitat modeling. Radio‐locations from lynx confirm lower‐quality habitats of low resistance to movement were used by traveling lynx. Our results thus suggest traveling lynx do indeed use a much broader range of habitats than do lynx moving within core areas. For lynx in the North Cascades, our results show that maintaining connectivity will require preserving habitats and linkages that would previously have been deemed unsuitable for lynx. Maintaining connectivity for lynx is particularly important given the many recent large wildfires in this region that have reduced the number of mature forest stands that form prime habitat for lynx. Policy implications. Our results strongly suggest that habitat connectivity models should be based on empirical information of animal location data and focused on matrix habitat analysis. Traveling predators use a wide suite of habitats, resulting in more and broader linkage zones that should inform conservation efforts. Failure to identify these areas of functional connectivity could result in the oversight of usable linkage zones, leaving them without protection and vulnerable to degradation.

T1  - Mechanical thinning to restore oak savanna promoted predator assemblages of gypsy moth pupae in Michigan
AN  - 2115764197
AB  - The United States Forest Service conducted an oak savanna restoration using thinning and prescribed burning in the Manistee National Forest in Michigan to provide additional habitat for species dependent on this rare community type, including the Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis). Because the Karner blue butterfly is a federally endangered species, managers cannot spray Bt‐k (Bacillus thurigiensis var kurstaki) in areas undergoing restoration to control exotic invasive defoliators, such as European gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar).Although gypsy moths are invasive in North America, several native predators, such as white‐footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), other small mammals and invertebrates, help keep gypsy moth populations at nondestructive levels.The present study investigated whether the small mammal community and gypsy moth predation rates were affected by the type of mechanical forest thinning method (bulldozer, masticator, shear cutter) used during an oak savanna restoration at two sites in Michigan within the suppression zone in 2010 and 2011.Predation rates on gypsy moth pupae were higher in bulldozer and shear cutter thinned compared with control plots at both sites in 2010. White‐footed mice relative abundance was significantly higher in thinned compared with control plots at one site in 2010 and 2011.Thinning maintained or promoted white‐footed mice abundance, which will maintain or enhance predation on gypsy moth pupae during oak savanna restoration.

T1  - Salvage logging in the world’s forests: Interactions between natural disturbance and logging need recognition
AN  - 2127059288
AB  - AimLarge disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests. Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance‐interaction theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been addressed in empirical research globally.InsightsFirst, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely result from interaction modifications—i.e., from non‐additive effects– between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging disturbance due to complex socio‐ecological interactions. Both interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that, whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date.ConclusionsInteractions between natural disturbance and logging imply that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.

T1  - Conservation of disappearing cultural landscape’s biodiversity: are people in Belarus willing to pay for wet grassland restoration?
AN  - 2088813923
AB  - Abandonment of traditional farming practices, such as hay-making and pasturing, has resulted in rapid loss of open wet grassland habitats in Europe. The globally threatened Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola L.) is a bird species that occurs almost exclusively in open fen mires, which have virtually disappeared in Western Europe, but still persist locally in Eastern Europe. Focusing on the world’s most important breeding site for Aquatic Warbler, the Zvaniec fen mire in Belarus, we estimated Belarusian citizens’ willingness-to-pay for adequate conservation management of this fen mire and its focal species the Aquatic Warbler. Results from a discrete choice experiment indicated that Belarusian citizens were willing to pay for appropriate conservation programmes of the Zvaniec fen mire. Scything and mechanical mowing were preferred compared to controlled burning, and especially over herbicide treatment of encroaching shrubs. Conservation management was preferred over legal protection of wetland areas without management. Respondents considered such passive conservation to be insufficient to maintain open fen mire habitat and gave a higher priority to active conservation management programmes. These preferences are consistent with evidence-based knowledge about what is effective conservation management for the Aquatic Warbler. Given the gradual disappearance of Europe’s traditional cultural landscapes, we discuss the challenge to fund the maintenance of this biocultural biodiversity legacy.

T1  - RESPONSES OF A MONTANE LIZARD ASSEMBLAGE TO AN EXTENDED DROUGHT
AN  - 2414424258
AB  - Modern climate change will increase temperatures, as well as the frequency and severity of droughts and wildfires across the semiarid montane regions of the southwestern United States. Predictions of reduced habitat suitability and increases in extinctions precipitated by climate change derive from modeled responses to these conditions, especially increased temperatures. What is often lacking are empirical tests of those modeled predictions. Here I report findings from surveys of montane lizard assemblages during a period of increased temperatures, extended drought, and including a wildfire. i selected survey routes that included upper-elevation limits for western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), granite spiny lizards (Sceloporus orcuttii), and side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), as well as the lower limits for southern sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus vandenburgianus), to measure the extent to which habitat occupancy shifted as drought conditions changed over 4 years. At the onset of drought, the abundance of all species declined. After initial declines, populations stabilized and i observed recruitment, positive population growth, and elevation shifts with only modest increases in rainfall. once the drought abated, there were further increases in recruitment and population growth, but a colder winter and heavy snows in 2017 were coincident with declines and range contractions in both western fence and side-blotched lizards on the higher-elevation survey route. There was no indication that any of these species populations were at risk of local extinctions; rather, shifts at range margins and use of microclimates revealed resilience and mechanisms of how these species might deal with future conditions, including occupying climate refugia.Alternate abstract:El cambio climático actual aumentarálas temperaturas, asícomo la frecuencia y severidad de las sequías e incendios forestales en las regiones montãnosas semiáridas del suroeste de los Estados Unidos. Las predicciones de la reducción en la idoneidad de hábitat y el aumento de las extinciones por causa del cambio climático se derivan de respuestas modeladas a estas condiciones, especialmente al aumento de las temperaturas. Con frecuencia se carece de pruebas empíricas de esas predicciones modeladas. Aquíse presentan los resultados de muestreos en comunidades de lagartijas de montãna durante un período de aumento de temperatura, sequía prolongada e incluso un incendio forestal. Se seleccionaron rutas de muestreo que incluyeron límites superiores de altura para la lagartija escamosa del occidente (Sceloporus occidentalis), lagartija espinosa de granito (Sceloporus orcuttii) y lagartija de mancha lateral norteña (Uta stansburiana), asícomo límites inferiores para la lagartija de salvia meridional (Sceloporus vandenburgianus), para medir el grado en que la ocupación del hábitat se modificócuando las condiciones de sequía cambiaron durante 4 ãnos. Al inicio de la sequía, la abundancia de todas las especies disminuyó. Después de los descensos iniciales, las poblaciones se estabilizaron y se observóreclutamiento, crecimiento poblacional positivo y cambios de elevación con solo incrementos moderados en la precipitación. Cuando la sequía disminuyó, se incrementaron el reclutamiento y el crecimiento poblacional, pero un invierno más frío y fuertes nevadas en 2017 coincidieron con descensos y reducción de la distribución tanto en la lagartija escamosa del occidente como en la de mancha lateral norteña en la elevación superior de la ruta de muestreos. No se observaron indicios de que alguna de las poblaciones de estas especies estuviera en riesgo de extinción local; más bien, los cambios en los límites de distribución y el uso de microclimas revelaron resiliencia y mecanismos con los que estas especies podrían hacer frente a las condiciones futuras, incluyendo la ocupación de refugios climáticos.

T1  - Occupancy and detectability modelling of vertebrates in northern Australia using multiple sampling methods
AN  - 2111726267
AB  - Understanding where species occur and how difficult they are to detect during surveys is crucial for designing and evaluating monitoring programs, and has broader applications for conservation planning and management. In this study, we modelled occupancy and the effectiveness of six sampling methods at detecting vertebrates across the Top End of northern Australia. We fitted occupancy-detection models to 136 species (83 birds, 33 reptiles, 20 mammals) of 242 recorded during surveys of 333 sites in eight conservation reserves between 2011 and 2016. For modelled species, mean occupancy was highly variable: birds and reptiles ranged from 0.01–0.81 and 0.01–0.49, respectively, whereas mammal occupancy was lower, ranging from 0.02–0.30. Of the 11 environmental covariates considered as potential predictors of occupancy, topographic ruggedness, elevation, maximum temperature, and fire frequency were retained more readily in the top models. Using these models, we predicted species occupancy across the Top End of northern Australia (293,017 km2) and generated species richness maps for each species group. For mammals and reptiles, high richness was associated with rugged terrain, while bird richness was highest in coastal lowland woodlands. On average, detectability of diurnal birds was higher per day of surveys (0.33 ± 0.09) compared with nocturnal birds per night of spotlighting (0.13 ± 0.06). Detectability of reptiles was similar per day/night of pit trapping (0.30 ± 0.09) as per night of spotlighting (0.29 ± 0.11). On average, mammals were highly detectable using motion-sensor cameras for a week (0.36 ± 0.06), with exception of smaller-bodied species. One night of Elliott trapping (0.20 ± 0.06) and spotlighting (0.19 ± 0.06) was more effective at detecting mammals than cage (0.08 ± 0.03) and pit trapping (0.05 ± 0.04). Our estimates of species occupancy and detectability will help inform decisions about how best to redesign a long-running vertebrate monitoring program in the Top End of northern Australia.

T1  - Variation in habitat management alters risk aversion behavior in lizards
AN  - 2092359536
AB  - Habitat management can generate variation in a cascade of organismal traits linked to the environment, particularly in small, endemic species such as the Florida scrub lizard (Sceloporus woodi). For example, reduction of arboreal perches through clear-cutting in managed Florida scrub may alter lizard behavior, and predation risk, which in turn, may alter lizard abundance. We ask whether risk aversion behavior is habitat-specific, and potentially reflects predation intensity. Four predator avoidance traits were quantified in S. woodi from longleaf pine and Florida scrub habitats. We also asked if habitat type was linked to phenotypic traits (e.g., body size, hind limb length) that might alter risk aversion behaviors. Lizards in longleaf pine had greater detection distance and flight distance and were farther from refuges, indicating higher risk aversion compared to populations in Florida scrub. Given this, males may be more sensitive to predation than females, especially during the breeding season. Males were encountered more often than females in both habitats, and detected from a greater distance in longleaf, but not Florida scrub. Population density may affect lizard behavior, yet we found no difference in population density between the habitats for stands sampled, nor any relationship of population density to risk aversion behaviors. These results demonstrate that management activities, which alter vegetation and substrate characteristics, also alter aspects of lizard behavior that subsequently may influence predation pressure among sub-populations.Significance statementHuman activity has fundamentally changed most habitats on Earth such that management is now required for conservation of native species and preservation of resources. We hypothesized that differential management between longleaf pine and Florida scrub habitats might alter risk aversion behavior. Our results show that lizards use different refuges between habitat types, and that lizards are more weary in the more open habitat (longleaf pine). Frequent prescribed fire in longleaf pine maintains a suitable thermal microclimate and access to key refuges (mature trees), whereas clear-cutting of Florida scrub yields more shrubs, no vertical perches, and higher temperatures. Thus, habitat management fundamentally alters predator avoidance behavior, which in turn is linked to predation intensity and the probability of population persistence. This study highlights the challenge of designing management plans that are beneficial to all constituent species.

T1  - An experimental test of whether pyrodiversity promotes mammal diversity in a northern Australian savanna
AN  - 2087491853
AB  - The increasing awareness that a fire regime that promotes biodiversity in one system can threaten biodiversity in another has resulted in a shift away from fire management based on vague notions of maximising pyrodiversity, towards determining the optimal fire regime based on the demonstrated requirements of target species.We utilised a long‐running, replicated fire experiment on Melville Island, the largest island off the northern Australian coast, to test the importance of pyrodiversity for native mammals in a northern Australian savanna landscape. We first developed statistical models to determine how native mammal abundance has responded to nine years of experimentally‐manipulated fire frequency. Next, given each species' modelled response to fire frequency, we identified the level of pyrodiversity and optimal mix of fire frequencies that would be expected to maximise mammal diversity and abundance, and minimise extinction risk. This was done for both the entire mammal assemblage and for the mammal species currently declining on Melville Island.Fire frequency was a significant predictor of abundance of the northern brown bandicoot Isoodon macrourus, black‐footed tree‐rat Mesembriomys gouldii, brush‐tailed rabbit‐rat Conilurus penicillatus, grassland melomys Melomys burtoni, pale field‐rat Rattus tunneyi, and mice/dunnarts but not for the common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula.The geometric mean abundance (GMA) of the entire mammal assemblage was positively associated with pyrodiversity, but peaked at an intermediate value. Hence, maximising pyrodiversity would reduce native mammal assemblage GMA below its potential maximum. The fire history for an area that maximised the entire native mammal assemblage GMA consisted of 57% long‐unburnt, 43% triennially burnt and <1% annually burnt. Pyrodiversity did not reduce the extinction risk, nor increase the GMA of declining mammals above that predicted in areas entirely annually or triennially burnt.Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a useful approach with which to develop fire management strategies based on the demonstrated requirements of target species. By comparing the optimal fire regime identified for the conservation of threatened species and that identified for the entire mammal assemblage, we demonstrate the flexibility of this approach to tailor fire management to address specific management priorities in other fire‐prone environments.

T1  - Toward a better understanding of climate and human impacts on late Holocene fire regimes in the Pacific Northwest, USA
AN  - 2177129938
AB  - In order to fully appreciate the role that fire, both natural and anthropogenic, had in shaping pre-Euro-American settlement landscapes in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), it is necessary to develop a more robust method of evaluating paleofire reconstructions. Here we demonstrate an approach that includes the identification of charcoal morphotypes (i.e. visually distinct charcoal particles), and incorporates both paleoecological and archaeological data sets, to more specifically determine both the nature of past fire regimes (i.e. fuel type and fire severity) and the likely ignition source of those fires. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by reconstructing the late Holocene fire and vegetation histories of Lake Oswego (Clackamas County), Oregon, and Fish Lake (Okanogan County), Washington, using macroscopic charcoal and pollen analysis of sediment cores. The histories were compared with climatic records from the PNW as well as archaeological, ethnographic, and historical records from the Lower Columbia River Valley and Southern Columbia Plateau cultural regions. Our results indicate that while centennial-to-millennial-scale climate change had limited influence on the fire regimes at the study sites during the past ∼3800 years, the use of fire by Native Americans for a variety of reasons, particularly after ca. 1200 calendar years before present (AD 750), had a far greater impact. Charcoal morphotype ratios also indicate that fires in the two watersheds were fundamentally different in their severity and impact, and led to major shifts in the forests and woodlands surrounding Lake Oswego, but helped maintain the ponderosa pine-dominated forest at Fish Lake. The elimination of fire from the two study sites during the past 100–300 years is likely the combined result of Euro-American contact and the arrival of disease in the PNW, as well as 20th-century fire suppression and grazing effects on fuel continuity, which has implications for future forest management and restoration efforts in the PNW.

T1  - Impact of intense disturbance on the structure and composition of wet-eucalypt forests: A case study from the Tasmanian 2016 wildfires
AN  - 2072699731
AB  - Fire is a key process in eucalypt communities, exerting a strong influence on the composition, structure and functioning of forests. Much of the research on the fire response of temperate, wet-sclerophyll trees in Australia comes from Victoria, where the dominant eucalypt is Eucalyptus regnans. In contrast, central and northern Tasmanian forests, dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis, are relatively understudied. There is a need to determine whether Tasmanian wet-sclerophyll forests, though the same forest type in name, are functionally different in floristics and response to fire. Here we document the forest community response to a natural wildfire event in Tasmania—using opportunistic before/after control/impact (BACI) data from pre-existing monitoring plots. Uniting pre- and post-fire floristic data, we quantified mortality and regeneration of eucalypt, acacia and other dominant tree species, and tree ferns, Dicksonia antarctica, in response to wildfire. We also evaluated the density of eucalypt and acacia seedling establishment between burnt and unburnt forests, and quantified faunal responses to fire. Despite moderate-to-high intensity burning in patches across the plot, mortality of eucalypts, acacias and tree ferns due to fire were low. By contrast, fire-sensitive rainforest species showed low survival, though were able to persist in unburnt refugia. Eucalypt and acacia seedling regeneration was high in the burnt plot, suggesting that E. delegatensis forests regenerate without stand-replacing fire events. This contrasts to Victorian E. regnans forests, whose persistence is dependent on high-severity stand-replacing events. We also found some group-specific avifaunal and invertebrate responses to the fire event, which are broadly reflective of responses documented in other Victorian-based studies. Our results have implications for Tasmanian wet-forest silvicultural practices, which are based on the principle of stand-replacement after fire. The broader relevance of this work to forest ecology is in demonstrating the serendipitous opportunities that can arise with baseline monitoring plots.

T1  - Eastern massasauga demography and extinction risk under prescribed‐fire scenarios
AN  - 2057174514
AB  - The use of poorly estimated or surrogate population parameter estimates to assess population viability may result in misleading predictions. Consequently, a critical first step to understanding population health and the effects of land management practices on threatened species is estimation of site‐specific demographic parameters. A major threat to the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is habitat loss due to encroachment of woody vegetation and invasive species. Current land management practices require periodic burning or mowing to maintain habitat suitability. Although these methods improve habitat quality, they may also increase the risk of depredation due to reduced ground cover if burns are too extensive or cause mortality if conducted when snakes are active. We fitted contemporary capture–recapture and matrix models to an 8‐year dataset to estimate population parameters for an eastern massasauga population near the range center of the species, where the largest number of eastern massasauga populations may still persist. From 2009 to 2016, we captured 826 eastern massasaugas 1,776 times. In general, annual survival increased with increasing age (age 0 = 0.38, age 1 = 0.65, age 2 = 0.67, age ≥3 females = 0.71, age ≥3 males = 0.66). Abundance estimates ranged from 84 to 140 adults and annual reproductive frequency was 0.44 (95% CI = 0.29–0.59). We simulated increased mortality due to prescribed burns during spring, fall, and late fall for 50 and 100 years. The baseline model, which incorporated current prescribed‐fire practices, indicated a stable population with only a 0.2–0.6% probability of extinction over 100 years, suggesting that management practices at this site are sustainable if they remain unchanged. Simulations of conservative increases in mortality due to fire changed the probability of extinction little over 50 years (≤0.7%) but increased probability of extinction up to 24.5% over 100 years in the most pessimistic prescribed‐burn scenario. These prescribed‐burn simulations may be comparable to burn regimes used at other eastern massasauga sites. The population parameters estimated here provide information needed for assessing range‐wide population viability and investigating geographic variation in eastern massasauga demography. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Trade‐offs in berry production and biodiversity under prescribed burning and retention regimes in boreal forests
AN  - 2053275846
AB  - Green tree retention and prescribed burning are the practices used to mitigate negative effects of boreal forestry. Beside their effects on biodiversity, these practices should also promote non‐timber forest products (NTFPs). We assessed: (1) how prescribed burning and tree retention influence NTFPs by examining the production of bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry, Vaccinium vitis‐idaea; (2) if there are synergies or trade‐offs in the delivery of these NTFPs in relation to the delivery of species richness, focusing on five groups of forest‐dwelling species.We used a long‐term experiment located in eastern Finland, with three different harvesting treatments: clear‐cut logging, logging with retention patches and unlogged, which were combined with or without prescribed burning. Eleven years after the treatment application, we scored plant cover and berry production in different microhabitats within these treatments, while species richness data for five species groups (ground layer lichens and bryophytes, vascular plants, saproxylic beetles, pollinators—here bees and hoverflies) were collected at the stand level.Logging favoured cowberry production, particularly for plants growing in the vicinity of stumps. Logging was detrimental for cover and berry production of bilberry. Retention mitigated these negative effects slightly, but cover and berry production were still substantially lower compared to unlogged forests. Prescribed burning increased the cowberry production in retention patches and in unlogged forest. Bilberry production decreased with burning, except in unlogged forest where the effect was neutral.No single management treatment simultaneously favoured all values—NTFPs and richness—and trade‐offs among values were common. Only bilberry production and beetle diversity were higher under retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, compared to logged stands. Prescribed burning favoured many values when performed in combination with retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, but different treatment combinations favoured different species groups.Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that widely applied conservation practices in managed boreal forests are unlikely to benefit all ecosystem values everywhere. If high multifunctionality is desired, managing at a landscape scale, countering the local trade‐offs among values, may be more appropriate than the stand‐scale conservation practices commonly practiced today.

T1  - Chaparral bird community responses to prescribed fire and shrub removal in three management seasons
AN  - 2053272543
AB  - Chaparral, a type of shrubland common throughout the California Floristic Province, is subject to management and removal in regions where wildfire threatens human lives and property. Management practices include conducting prescribed burns outside of the historical fire season and employing mechanical fuel reduction (mastication). As the wildland–urban interface grows, particularly in coastal California, more of this ecosystem is subject to active management.To understand the ecological implications of current California chaparral fire management practices, we studied bird species composition, abundance and foraging guilds in managed and unmanaged chaparral over 5 years. Study areas were located in Mendocino County in the coast ranges of northern California. We contrast six chaparral removal or “fuels manipulation” treatments: (1) fall fire, (2) winter fire, (3) spring fire, (4) fall mastication, (5) spring mastication and (6) untreated control. Treatments and controls were implemented in plots 2 ha or larger, and replicated four times each.We find that species richness in prescribed fire treatments reaches comparable levels to controls in the first 3 years following treatment, whereas masticated units always have lower species richness. Generalized linear mixed models additionally confirm that mastication has highly negative effects on observed abundances of birds compared to controls and to prescribed fire.The season in which fuels reduction occurred was less important to species richness, although fall fire was more beneficial to bird abundance than spring or winter fire. Fire treatments in all seasons maintain the same general bird community structure as controls, while mastication results in strongly differentiated assemblages, increasing granivores while nearly excluding foliage gleaners.Synthesis and applications. We compare two California chaparral management techniques, prescribed fire and mastication, in three seasons (fall, winter and spring) in northern California, USA. We tracked chaparral bird community response in 23 experimental units for 2–5 years. We conclude that prescribed fire and mastication are not interchangeable management techniques, and that mastication negatively impacts bird communities, altering guild structure and reducing both diversity and abundance.

T1  - Incorporating disturbance into trophic ecology: Fire history shapes mesopredator suppression by an apex predator
AN  - 2053272526
AB  - Apex predators can suppress smaller bodied “mesopredators.” In doing so, they can provide refuge to species preyed upon by mesopredators, which is particularly important in regions where mesopredators are invasive. While most studies of mesopredator suppression focus on the response of mesopredators to human control of apex predators, other factors—including natural and anthropogenic disturbance—also drive the occurrence of apex predators and, in doing so, might shape spatial patterns of mesopredator suppression.We examined the role of fire in shaping the occurrence of an apex predator and, by extension, mesopredators and small mammals in a fire‐prone region of semiarid Australia. We measured the activity of an apex predator (the dingo Canis dingo); an invasive mesopredator it is known to suppress (the red fox Vulpes vulpes); and two species of native small mammal (Mitchell's hopping mouse Notomys mitchelli; silky mouse Pseudomys apodemoides) that are potential prey, across 21 fire mosaics (each 12.56 km2). We used piecewise structural equation modelling and scenario analysis to explore the interactions between fire, predators and prey.We found that dingoes were affected by fire history at the landscape scale, showing a preference for recently burned areas. While foxes were not directly affected by fire history, a negative association between dingoes and foxes meant that fire had an indirect impact on foxes, mediated through dingoes. Despite the suppression of foxes by dingoes, we did not observe a trophic cascade as small mammals were not negatively associated with foxes or positively associated with dingoes.Synthesis and applications. Disturbance regimes have the capacity to shape patterns of mesopredator suppression when they alter the distributions of apex predators. Environmental change that promotes native predators can therefore help suppress mesopredators—a common conservation objective in regions with invasive mesopredators. The indirect consequences of disturbance regimes should be considered when managing disturbance (e.g. fire) for biodiversity conservation.

T1  - Interactions Among Fuel Management, Species Composition, Bark Beetles, and Climate Change and the Potential Effects on Forests of the Lake Tahoe Basin
AN  - 2047851179
AB  - Climate-driven increases in wildfires, drought conditions, and insect outbreaks are critical threats to forest carbon stores. In particular, bark beetles are important disturbance agents although their long-term interactions with future climate change are poorly understood. Droughts and the associated moisture deficit contribute to the onset of bark beetle outbreaks although outbreak extent and severity is dependent upon the density of host trees, wildfire, and forest management. Our objective was to estimate the effects of climate change and bark beetle outbreaks on ecosystem carbon dynamics over the next century in a western US forest. Specifically, we hypothesized that (a) bark beetle outbreaks under climate change would reduce net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and increase uncertainty and (b) these effects could be ameliorated by fuels management. We also examined the specific tree species dynamics—competition and release—that determined NECB response to bark beetle outbreaks. Our study area was the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB), CA and NV, USA, an area of diverse forest types encompassing steep elevation and climatic gradients and representative of mixed-conifer forests throughout the western United States. We simulated climate change, bark beetles, wildfire, and fuels management using a landscape-scale stochastic model of disturbance and succession. We simulated the period 2010–2100 using downscaled climate projections. Recurring droughts generated conditions conducive to large-scale outbreaks; the resulting large and sustained outbreaks significantly increased the probability of LTB forests becoming C sources over decadal time scales, with slower-than-anticipated landscape-scale recovery. Tree species composition was substantially altered with a reduction in functional redundancy and productivity. Results indicate heightened uncertainty due to the synergistic influences of climate change and interacting disturbances. Our results further indicate that current fuel management practices will not be effective at reducing landscape-scale outbreak mortality. Our results provide critical insights into the interaction of drivers (bark beetles, wildfire, fuel management) that increase the risk of C loss and shifting community composition if bark beetle outbreaks become more frequent.

T1  - Annual burning of semi‐natural grasslands for conservation favours tall‐grown species with high nectar production
AN  - 2047459797
AB  - Species‐rich semi‐natural grasslands in Europe are a main target for conservation efforts, and alternative methods to the traditional management of mowing or grazing would be welcome due to the difficulties in maintaining traditional management practices. One such method proposed is burning of grassland vegetation during late winter or spring. To evaluate the effects of annual spring burning vs annual mowing on semi‐natural grassland vegetation, we compared the frequency of species in eleven field experiments in southern Sweden after ca 14 years. Out of the 88 species analyzed, five were more frequent in burnt plots compared with mowed plots (Vicia cracca, Cirsium arvense, Urtica dioica, Galium verum, Convallaria majalis). In contrast, 37 species were significantly less frequent in burnt plots compared with mowed ones, those with the largest differences being Ranunculus acris, Briza media, Veronica chamaedrys, Festuca ovina, Plantago lanceolata and Anthoxanthum odoratum. Tall‐grown species and those with preferences for N‐rich soils increased in frequency under an annual spring‐burn regime, compared with annual mowing, as did species producing larger amounts of nectar. Hence, although vegetation composition becomes more trivial with annual spring burns, there might be long‐term benefits for nectar‐feeding insects.

T1  - Sagebrush treatments influence annual population change for greater sage‐grouse
AN  - 2047457298
AB  - Vegetation management practices have been applied worldwide to enhance habitats for a variety of wildlife species. Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp.) communities, iconic to western North America, have been treated to restore herbaceous understories through chemical, mechanical, and prescribed burning practices thought to improve habitat conditions for greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other species. Although the response of structural attributes of sagebrush communities to treatments is well understood, there is a need to identify how treatments influence wildlife population dynamics. We investigated the influence of vegetation treatments occurring in Wyoming, United States, from 1994 to 2012 on annual sage‐grouse population change using yearly male sage‐grouse lek counts. We investigated this response across 1, 3, 5, and 10‐year post‐treatment lags to evaluate how the amount of treated sagebrush communities and time since treatment influenced population change, while accounting for climate, wildfire, and anthropogenic factors. With the exception of chemical treatments exhibiting a positive association with sage‐grouse population change 11 years after implementation, population response to treatments was either neutral or negative for at least 11 years following treatments. Our work supports a growing body of research advocating against treating big sagebrush habitats for sage‐grouse, particularly in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. t. wyomingensis). Loss and fragmentation of sagebrush habitats has been identified as a significant threat for remaining sage‐grouse populations. Because sagebrush may take decades to recover following treatments, we recommend practitioners use caution when designing projects to alter remaining habitats, especially when focused on habitat requirements for one life stage and a single species.

T1  - Effects of rotational prescribed burning and sheep grazing on moorland plant communities: Results from a 60‐year intervention experiment
AN  - 2047323880
AB  - The effect of prescribed burning for conservation management of plant communities is controversial for moorlands growing on peat. These ecosystems provide many services that may be damaged by fire, hence it is important to fully assess its impact on all aspects of ecosystem structure and function experimentally over relatively long time‐scales. This paper describes change in community composition, major plant species, and plant functional types on moorland on peat in upland Britain over 60 years subject to 3 burning treatments after an initial burn in 1954/1955: no further burn and burning at 10‐ and 20‐year intervals (all ± sheep grazing). Data were analysed using multivariate and univariate methods. Vegetation composition and individual species abundance reflected the degree of disturbance. The least disturbed was dominated by Calluna vulgaris and pleurocarpous mosses, whereas the most disturbed treatment (burned every 10 years) had greater Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum spp., acrocarpous mosses, liverworts, and lichens. The 20‐year treatment was intermediate in response disturbance. Repeated burning increased species abundance‐weighted Ellenberg values for moisture, reaction, light through time, and fertility; the exception was the 10‐year rotation for fertility. These confirm that prescribed burning is not deleterious to peat‐forming species (Eriophorum spp. and Sphagnum spp.), indeed these species were found in greater abundance in frequently burned treatments. It also confirms that a no‐burn policy will lead to increasing dominance of C. vulgaris, a flammable, fire‐adapted shrub, which increases summer wildfire risk. These results inform conservation management policy for moorland vegetation growing on peat; for this site, a 20‐year prescribed burning rotation is recommended.

T1  - Adult bobcat (<i>Lynx rufus</i>) habitat selection in a longleaf pine savanna
AN  - 2035206862
AB  - BackgroundPine savannas are primarily managed with frequent prescribed fire (≤ 3 years) to promote diversity of flora and fauna, and to maintain open, park-like conditions needed by species such as the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management decisions.MethodsWe examined bobcat habitat selection in a pine savanna managed with frequent fires at two spatial scales (i.e., study area boundary [hereafter, landscape scale]) and annual area of use [95% kernel density; local scale]), and assessed effects of prescribed fire on bobcat habitat selection. Specifically, we monitored 45 bobcats (16 males and 29 females) during 2001–2007.ResultsWe found differential habitat selection by sex. At the landscape scale, female bobcats were closer to mixed pine-hardwoods, young pine, and secondary roads, but farther from mature pine and hardwoods stands relative to males. We found no difference in selection of agriculture, shrub-scrub, and primary roads between sexes. At the annual area of use scale, female bobcats were closer to secondary roads, but farther from agriculture and shrub-scrub relative to males. We found no difference in selection of mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and primary roads between sexes. Bobcats primarily selected for stands burned ≤ 1.1 years post-fire.ConclusionsOur results show that bobcats exploit a broad range of habitat types in pine landscapes managed with frequent fire and commonly use recently burned stands (≤ 1.1 year post-fire), suggesting prey in many areas of this system are at risk of bobcat predation. Additionally, we suggest land managers consider scale of selection by bobcats when developing habitat management strategies.

T1  - Relationships Between Cattle and Biodiversity in Multiuse Landscape Revealed by Kenya Long-Term Exclosure Experiment
AN  - 2033242725
AB  - On rangelands worldwide, cattle interact with many forms of biodiversity, most obviously with vegetation and other large herbivores. Since 1995, we have been manipulating the presence of cattle, mesoherbivores, and megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes) in a series of eighteen 4-ha (10-acre) plots at the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment. We recently (2013) crossed these treatments with small-scale controlled burns. These replicated experimental treatments simulate different land management practices. We seek to disentangle the complex relationships between livestock and biodiversity in a biome where worldwide, uneasy coexistence is the norm. Here, we synthesize more than 20 yr of data to address three central questions about the potentially unique role of cattle in savanna ecology: 1) To what extent do cattle and wild herbivores compete with or facilitate each other? 2) Are the effects of cattle on vegetation similar to those of wildlife, or do cattle have unique effects? 3) What effects do cattle and commercial cattle management have on other savanna organisms? We found that 1) Cattle compete at least as strongly with browsers as grazers, and wildlife compete with cattle, although these negative effects are mitigated by cryptic herbivores (rodents), rainfall, fire, and elephants. 2) Cattle effects on herbaceous vegetation (composition, productivity) are similar to those of the rich mixture of ungulates they replace, differing mainly due to the greater densities of cattle. In contrast, cattle, wild mesoherbivores, and megaherbivores have strongly guild-specific effects on woody vegetation. 3) Both cattle and wild ungulates regulate cascades to other consumers, notably termites, rodents, and disease vectors (ticks and fleas) and pathogens. Overall, cattle management, at moderate stocking densities, can be compatible with the maintenance of considerable native biodiversity, although reducing livestock to these densities in African rangelands is a major challenge.

AB  - An understanding of the hydrogeology of Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) in northern Arizona, USA, is critical for future resource protection. The ~750 springs in GRCA provide both perennial and seasonal flow to numerous desert streams, drinking water to wildlife and visitors in an otherwise arid environment, and habitat for rare, endemic and threatened species. Spring behavior and flow patterns represent local and regional patterns in aquifer recharge, reflect the geologic structure and stratigraphy, and are indicators of the overall biotic health of the canyon. These springs, however, are subject to pressures from water supply development, changes in recharge from forest fires and other land management activities, and potential contamination. Roaring Springs is the sole water supply for residents and visitors (>6 million/year), and all springs support valuable riparian habitats with very high species diversity. Most springs flow from the karstic Redwall-Muav aquifer and show seasonal patterns in flow and water chemistry indicative of variable aquifer porosities, including conduit flow. They have Ca/Mg-HCO3 dominated chemistry and trace elements consistent with nearby deep wells drilled into the Redwall-Muav aquifer. Tracer techniques and water-age dating indicate a wide range of residence times for many springs, supporting the concept of multiple porosities. A perched aquifer produces small springs which issue from the contacts between sandstone and shale units, with variable groundwater residence times. Stable isotope data suggest both an elevational and seasonal difference in recharge between North and South Rim springs. This review highlights the complex nature of the groundwater system.Alternate abstract:Une compréhension de l’hydrogéologie du Parc National du Grand Canyon (GRCA) dans le nord de l’Arizona, Etats-Unis d’Amérique, est. nécessaire pour la future protection de la ressource. Les quelques 750 sources du GRCA apportent des flux aussi bien pérennes que saisonniers à de nombreux cours d’eau du désert, de l’eau de boisson à la faune sauvage et aux visiteurs dans un environnement aride sans cela, et un habitat pour des espèces rares, endémiques et menacées. Le comportement des sources et modalités de flux représentent les schémas locaux et régionaux de la recharge des aquifères, reflètent la structure géologique et stratigraphique, et sont des indicateurs de la santé globale du biote du canyon. Ces sources, toutefois, sont sujettes à diverses pressions exercées par le développement de l’approvisionnement en eau, par les modifications de la recharge du fait des feux de forêts et d’autres activités de gestion du territoire, et à des contaminations potentielles. La source Roaring est. l’unique approvisionnement en eau pour les résidents et les visiteurs (>6 millions/an), et toutes les sources soutiennent les habitats riverains caractérisés par une très grande diversité d’espèces. La plupart du flux des sources provient de l’aquifère karstique de Redwall-Muay et montre une variabilité saisonnière de flux et de qualité des eaux indiquant des porosités d’aquifère variables, y compris les écoulements en conduits. Elles ont une chimie de type Ca/Mg-HCO3 dominant et des éléments traces en accord avec celle des puits profonds forés dans l’aquifère de Redwall-Muav. Les techniques de traçage et de datation des eaux indiquent une large gamme de temps de résidence pour de nombreuses sources, confirmant ainsi le concept de porosité multiple. Un aquifère perché produit des petites sources au niveau des contacts entre les grès et les schistes, caractérisées par des temps de résidence variable des eaux souterraines. Les données d’isotopes stables suggèrent à la fois une différence d’altitude et de saison de la recharge entre les sources du Nord et du Sud de Rim. Cette revue met en évidence la nature complexe du système aquifère.Alternate abstract:Una comprensión de la hidrogeología del Parque Nacional del Gran Cañón (GRCA) en el norte de Arizona, EE.UU., es fundamental para la futura protección de los recursos. Los ~750 manantiales en GRCA proporcionan el flujo estacional y perenne a las numerosas corrientes del desierto, agua de bebida para la fauna y los visitantes en un ambiente de otra manera árido, y el hábitat para las especies raras, endémicas y amenazadas. Los patrones de comportamiento y flujo del manantial representan patrones locales y regionales en la recarga del acuífero, reflejan la estructura geológica y la estratigrafía, y son indicadores de la salud biótica general del cañón. Estos manantiales, sin embargo, están sujetos a presiones del desarrollo del suministro de agua, cambios en la recarga a partir de los incendios forestales y otras actividades de manejo de la tierra, y la potencial contaminación. Roaring Springs es el único abastecimiento de agua para residentes y visitantes (> 6 millones/año), y todos los manantiales apoyan hábitats ribereños valiosos con una diversidad muy alta de especies. La mayoría de los manantiales fluyen por el acuífero kárstico de Redwall-Muav y muestran patrones estacionales en el flujo y la química del agua indicativa de porosidades variables del acuífero, incluyendo el flujo de conducto. La química dominante es Ca/Mg-HCO3 y elementos trazas congruentes con los pozos profundos cercanos perforados en el acuífero Redwall-Muav. Las técnicas de trazabilidad y la datación de la edad del agua indican un amplio rango de tiempos de residencia para muchos manantiales, apoyando el concepto de porosidades múltiples. Un acuífero colgado produce pequeños manantiales que descargan en los contactos entre unidades de arenisca y pizarra, con tiempos variables de residencia en el agua subterránea. Los datos de isótopos estables sugieren una diferencia de elevación y estacional en la recarga entre los manantiales del borde Norte y Sur.

O comportamento das nascentes e padrões de escoamento representam os padrões locais e regionais na recarga subterrânea, refletem a estrutura geológica e estratigráfica, e são indicadores da saúde biótica do canyon em geral. Essas nascentes, no entanto, estão sujeitas à pressões geradas em razão da demanda de água necessárias ao desenvolvimento, mudanças na recarga devido aos incêndios nas florestas e outras atividades de gestão da terra, e contaminação potencial. “Roaring Springs” é o único abastecimento de água para residentes e visitantes (> 6 milhões/ano), e todas as nascentes dão suporte para habitats ripários valiosos com uma diversidade de espécies bastante elevada. A maioria das nascentes fluem do aquífero cárstico Redwall-Muav e apresentam padrões sazonais no escoamento e química da água indicando porosidades variáveis do aquífero, inclusive escoamento preferencial por condutos. Quimicamente, essas nascentes são dominadas por Ca/Mg-HCO3 e elementos traço consistentes com poços profundos da redondeza perfurados no aquífero Redwall-Muav. Técnicas com traçadores e datação da idade da água indicam ampla variedade de tempos de residência para muitas nascentes, embasando o conceito de múltiplas porosidades. Um aquitardo produz pequenas nascentes que fluem dos contatos entre unidades de arenito e xisto, com variáveis tempos de residência da água subterrânea. Dados de isótopos estáveis sugerem tanto uma elevação quanto uma diferença sazonal na recarga entre as nascentes da borda/margem norte e sul. Essa revisão destaca a natureza complexa do sistema da água subterrânea.

T1  - THE INFLUENCE OF A CONTROLLED PRE-BREEDING SEASON BURN ON BIRD SPECIES ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY IN A NATIVE WARM-SEASON PRAIRIE PATCH
AN  - 2137840554
AB  - Few studies have examined fire as a management tool for obligate grassland birds on eastern warm-season prairie patches. Line transects were conducted during the May to June 2017 breeding season on a 24-hectare warm-season tall-grass prairie patch that had been burned 3 months earlier in February 2017. Prior to burning, this patch was dominated by an accumulation of tall, dead switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and a few forbs. The goal was to monitor for a potential change in the post-fire bird species abundance and richness compared to the pre-fire grassland bird occupancy. Prior to burning, obligate grassland species were essentially absent from the patch. In May post-burn, the mean height of the patch was ~30 cm and a substantial amount of bare ground persisted. In the May post-burn transects there was detected a modest number of savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis) and grasshopper (Ammodramus savannarum) sparrows, species attracted to shorter vegetation with less ground cover. Conversely, no Henslow's sparrows (A. henslowii) were detected. By June post-burn, as the mean vegetation height approached 140 cm, the dominant species once again were red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus), common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana). Observations suggest that a pre-breeding season burn on this warm-season patch did promote a change in species diversity in May post-burn, but not in June post-burn. In order to attract obligate grassland species to warm-season patches, instead of weed/shrub generalists, additional management strategies such as fall or spring mowing might need to be implemented.

T1  - EFFECTS OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON TERRESTRIAL VERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY IN AN OAK SAVANNA ECOSYSTEM
AN  - 2137838661
AB  - Oak savanna and its associated species in the midwest United States are being depleted and degraded. Oak savanna, a globally rare ecosystem, is dwindling because of hardwood encroachment, agricultural conversion and fire suppression. Disturbance is critical in an oak savanna ecosystem to maintain proper habitat structures for native species. Land management practices like herbicide applications, mechanical vegetation removal, and prescribed fire are all utilized to restore and maintain these early successional habitats in northwest Ohio by subduing tree encroachment. It is critical to understand the relationship between management intensity and wildlife diversity and abundance in such a highly managed and diverse ecosystem. To examine these relationships, 15 sites were established in two parks in Lucas County, in northwest Ohio. Point counts were conducted to detect and count avian and mammalian species day and night, May to October. Camera traps were used to assess wildlife within sites. Management data, provided by land managers, was aggregated per site via GIS and compared to diversity and abundance measures. Analysis included using a pair-wise correlation test, found that increasing management instances per site yielded a significantly higher avian abundance per site (p = 0.0417). We also found, using non-parametric Spearman's test, that sites with more instances of prescribed fires had a greater abundance of snags (p = 0.025). These snags provide a resource for many wildlife species including woodpeckers, which were significantly and positively related to snag density (non-parametric Spearman's test, p = 0.0475). Adaptive and properly mimicked management practices are critical to sustaining the structure of these globally rare oak savanna ecosystems.

T1  - Coordination through databases can improve prescribed burning as a conservation tool to promote forest biodiversity
AN  - 2015714060
AB  - Prescribed fires are a common nature conservation practice. They are executed by several parties with limited coordination among them, and little consideration for wildfire occurrences and habitat requirements of fire-dependent species. Here, we gathered data on prescribed fires and wildfires in Sweden during 2011–2015 to (i) evaluate the importance and spatial extent of prescribed fires compared to wildfires and (ii) illustrate how a database can be used as a management tool for prescribed fires. We found that on average only 0.006% (prescribed 65%, wildfires 35%) of the Swedish forest burns per year, with 58% of the prescribed fires occurring on clearcuts. Also, both wildfires and prescribed fires seem to be important for the survival of fire-dependent species. A national fire database would simplify coordination and make planning and evaluation of prescribed fires more efficient. We propose an adaptive management strategy to improve the outcome of prescribed fires.

T1  - Wildfires managed for restoration enhance ecological resilience
AN  - 2268300936
AB  - Expanding the footprint of natural fire has been proposed as one potential solution to increase the pace of forest restoration programs in fire‐adapted landscapes of the western USA. However, studies that examine the long‐term socio‐ecological trade‐offs of expanding natural fire to reduce wildfire risk and create fire resilient landscapes are lacking. We used the model Envision to examine the outcomes that might result from increased area burned by what we call “restoration” wildfire in a landscape where the ecological benefits of wildfire are known, but the need to suppress high‐risk fires that threaten human values is also evident. Our study area, in the eastern Cascades of Oregon, USA, includes the Deschutes National Forest where large tracts of mixed conifer forest structure are outside the historical range of variation and characterized by multi‐layer, closed‐canopy stands. We found that simulation of one restoration wildfire per year in addition to high‐risk wildfires in the regular fire season and over the course of 50 yr resulted in a 23% increase in total area burned, but the same probability of fire‐on‐fire interactions. This translated into 0.3% of the national forest burned by restoration wildfire per year and had a small impact in area burned by high‐risk fires albeit more likely in extreme fire years. Smoke production doubled in the restoration scenario relative to the scenario without restoration wildfire, but still resulted in minimal smoke production in most years. Restoration fires burned with low‐ to mixed‐severity and led to a steady reduction in canopy cover and increase in resilient forest structure in dry‐forest types. Habitat for the federally protected northern spotted owl declined with the inclusion of restoration fire, while habitat for species that use recently burned forest stands (e.g., black‐backed woodpecker) increased. Our results suggest that restoration wildfire can improve forest resilience and contribute to restoration efforts in fire‐adapted forests, but there are trade‐offs (wildlife habitat, smoke, area burned in fire‐sensitive forest types), and the level of restoration fire use we simulated is unlikely to have a significant impact on the occurrence of high‐severity wildfires.

T1  - Demographic and genetic viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal in a fire prone, rapidly urbanizing landscape
AN  - 2021372998
AB  - The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population abundance than small-scale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local extirpation of I. obesulus and other small- to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however, adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-active conservation approach is required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-term probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and currently relatively common species from becoming rare.

T1  - Fire effects and ecological recovery pathways of tropical montane cloud forests along a time chronosequence
AN  - 1995032581
AB  - Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCFs) harbour high levels of biodiversity and large carbon stocks. Their location at high elevations make them especially sensitive to climate change, because a warming climate is enhancing upslope species migration, but human disturbance (especially fire) may in many cases be pushing the treeline downslope. TMCFs are increasingly being affected by fire, and the long‐term effects of fire are still unknown. Here, we present a 28‐year chronosequence to assess the effects of fire and recovery pathways of burned TMCFs, with a detailed analysis of carbon stocks, forest structure and diversity. We assessed rates of change of carbon (C) stock pools, forest structure and tree‐size distribution pathways and tested several hypotheses regarding metabolic scaling theory (MST), C recovery and biodiversity. We found four different C stock recovery pathways depending on the selected C pool and time since last fire, with a recovery of total C stocks but not of aboveground C stocks. In terms of forest structure, there was an increase in the number of small stems in the burned forests up to 5–9 years after fire because of regeneration patterns, but no differences on larger trees between burned and unburned plots in the long term. In support of MST, after fire, forest structure appears to approximate steady‐state size distribution in less than 30 years. However, our results also provide new evidence that the species recovery of TMCF after fire is idiosyncratic and follows multiple pathways. While fire increased species richness, it also enhanced species dissimilarity with geographical distance. This is the first study to report a long‐term chronosequence of recovery pathways to fire suggesting faster recovery rates than previously reported, but at the expense of biodiversity and aboveground C stocks.

T1  - Snowshoe hare multi-level habitat use in a fire-adapted ecosystem
AN  - 1989597015
AB  - Prescribed burning has the potential to improve habitat for species that depend on pyric ecosystems or other early successional vegetation types. For species that occupy diverse plant communities over the extent of their range, response to disturbances such as fire might vary based on post-disturbance vegetation dynamics among plant communities. Although responses of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) to fire have been studied in conifer-dominated forests in northern parts of the species' range, there is a lack of information on snowshoe hare habitat use in fire-dependent communities in southern parts of their range. We used global positioning system (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF) radio-collars to monitor the habitat use of 32 snowshoe hares in a scrub-oak (Quercus ilicifolia)-pitch pine (Pinus rigida) barrens complex in northeastern Pennsylvania where prescribed fire has been used for habitat restoration. The area contained stands that underwent prescribed burning 1-6 years prior to our study. Also, we investigated fine-scale determinants of habitat use within stands. We found that regardless of season, hares did not select for areas that had been burned within 6 years prior. Hares primarily used stands of older scrub oak, conifer, or hardwoods, which contained dense understory vegetation and canopy cover. Hare habitat use also was positively associated with stand edges. Our results suggest that hares do not respond to prescribed burning of scrub oak in the short-term. In addition, by focusing on structural determinants of habitat use, rather than broad-scale characteristics such as stand type, management strategies for snowshoe hares can be adapted over the extent of their range despite the multitude of different land cover types across which the species occurs. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.
Snowshoe hares in Pennsylvania selected for stands of older scrub oak, conifer, or hardwoods that contained dense understory vegetation and canopy cover. Regardless of season, hares did not select for areas that had been burned within 6 years prior, suggesting that hares do not respond to prescribed burning of scrub oak in the short-term.

AN  - 2209506130
AB  - Disturbance, both natural (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreaks, disease, windstorms, drought) and anthropogenic (e.g., timber harvesting, land conversion), can have a profound effect on hydrological processes through the impacts on vegetation dynamics.

(2016) found that reforestation of watersheds in the upper reach of the Poyang Lake watershed with subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest types in southeastern China decreased high flows but increased low flows, indicating that hydrological recovery through reforestation is largely dependent on watershed properties when impacts of forest change and climate are similar and comparable.

The results indicate that future ecological restoration should emphasize the importance of soil factors in this area.

Since desert riparian forests provide a variety of ecosystem services in arid environments and are also endangered ecosystem types, these results will facilitate conservation efforts of this community under a changing climate. 2 New observations of large-scale changes in water and carbon cycling and their underlying drivers Understanding the processes controlling evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) is essential in order to assess the impact of climate change on agro-ecosystems and develop adaptation strategies.

(2016) linked an ecosystem service model (Water Supply and Stress Index, WaSSI) with WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model) downscaled climate data to evaluate future (2031–2060) changes in ET, water yield and gross primary productivity compared with the baseline period of 1979–2007 across 82 773 watersheds in the conterminous United States.

T1  - Modeling anthropogenic and natural fire ignitions in an inner-alpine valley
AN  - 2185492530
AB  - Modeling and assessing the factors that drive forest fire ignitions is critical for fire prevention and sustainable ecosystem management. In southern Europe, the anthropogenic component of wildland fire ignitions is especially relevant. In the Alps, however, the role of fire as a component of disturbance regimes in forest and grassland ecosystems is poorly known. The aim of this work is to model the probability of fire ignition for an Alpine region in Italy using a regional wildfire archive (1995–2009) and MaxEnt modeling. We analyzed separately (i) winter forest fires, (ii) winter fires on grasslands and fallow land, and (iii) summer fires.  Predictors were related to morphology, climate, and land use; distance from infrastructures, number of farms, and number of grazing animals were used as proxies for the anthropogenic component. Collinearity among predictors was reduced by a principal component analysis. Regarding  ignitions, 30 % occurred in agricultural areas and 24 % in forests. Ignitions peaked in the late winter–early spring. Negligence from agrosilvicultural activities was the main cause of ignition (64 %); lightning accounted for 9 % of causes across the study time frame, but increased from 6 to 10 % between the first and second period of analysis. Models for all groups of fire had a high goodness of fit (AUC 0.90–0.95). Temperature was proportional to the probability of ignition, and precipitation was inversely proportional. Proximity from infrastructures had an effect only on winter fires, while the density of grazing animals had a remarkably different effect on summer (positive correlation) and winter (negative) fires. Implications are discussed regarding climate change, fire regime changes, and silvicultural prevention.  Such a spatially explicit approach allows us to carry out spatially targeted fire management strategies and may assist in developing better fire management plans.

T1  - Is cattle grazing more important than landscape heterogeneity for grasshoppers in Afromontane grassland?
AN  - 2162781665
AB  - Overgrazing is a major driver of habitat degradation, especially in southern Africa. Although grasshoppers are adapted to and benefit from natural disturbances, such as grazing by indigenous game and burning, we do not know how they respond to heavy cattle grazing, and how this response interacts with different fire regimes. We also do not know whether grasshoppers respond principally to these disturbances, to changes in the vegetation layer, or to larger landscape attributes (e.g. elevation). We addressed these questions in the topographically heterogeneous Central Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. We compared grasshopper assemblages among sites differing in grazing intensity (light, moderate and heavy), fire regime, rocky outcrops and vegetation structure, and attributes of landscape heterogeneity. The local environment (rocky outcrops, bare ground cover, grass height and total vegetation cover) was more important than landscape attributes for all measures of diversity. Grasshopper species richness was best explained by grazing intensity, with the specific response determined by fire regime. Greatest species richness was consistently recorded in heavily-grazed grassland. Thus, we found no evidence in support of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis. Grasshopper assemblage composition of areas with light grazing was different from those with heavy grazing, but areas with light grazing were similar to those with moderate grazing under all fire regimes. Different suites of grasshopper species were adapted to changes in the local environment, with greatest diversity (Shannon H’) associated with elevated levels of bare ground and sparse vegetation cover. The greatest proportion of rare, endemic and sensitive grasshoppers (incl.  Lentula minuta ,  Machaeridia conspersa  and  Qachasia fastigiata  ) was associated with a greater proportion of vegetation cover. The sensitivity of grasshopper assemblages to fire-grazing interactions, and the habitat requirements of different suites of species necessitates consideration of different types (fire and grazing) as well as levels of disturbances when adjusting management practices. We recommend that conservation of rare, endemic and sensitive grasshoppers should be prioritized, as these are most vulnerable to local extirpation.

T1  - Salvage logging effects on regulating and supporting ecosystem services — a systematic map
AN  - 2127681104
AB  - Wildfires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are increasingly common forest disturbances. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e., the felling and removal of the affected trees; however, this practice may represent an additional disturbance with effects on ecosystem processes and services. We developed a systematic map to provide an overview of the primary studies on this topic and created a database with information on the characteristics of the retrieved publications, including information on stands, disturbance, intervention, measured outcomes, and study design. Of 4341 retrieved publications, 90 were retained in the systematic map. These publications represented 49 studies, predominantly from North America and Europe. Salvage logging after wildfire was addressed more frequently than after insect outbreaks or windstorms. Most studies addressed logging after a single disturbance event, and replication of salvaged stands rarely exceeded 10. The most frequent response variables were tree regeneration, ground cover, and deadwood characteristics. This document aims to help managers find the most relevant primary studies on the ecological effects of salvage logging. It also aims to identify and discuss clusters and gaps in the body of evidence, relevant for scientists who aim to synthesize previous work or identify questions for future studies.Alternate abstract:Les feux de forêt, les épidémies d’insectes et les tempêtes de vent sont des perturbations forestières de plus en plus fréquentes. À la suite d’une perturbation, l’aménagement implique souvent une coupe de récupération, c.-à-d., l’abattage et le prélèvement des arbres endommagés. Cependant, cette pratique peut constituer une perturbation additionnelle et avoir des effets sur les services et processus de l’écosystème. Nous avons développé une carte systématique destinée à fournir un aperçu des études originales sur ce sujet et créé une base de données contenant de l’information sur les caractéristiques des publications retenues, incluant des informations sur les peuplements, la perturbation, l’intervention, les résultats mesurés et la méthodologie de l’étude. Des 4341 publications trouvées, 90 ont été retenues dans la carte systématique. Ces publications représentaient 49 études menées principalement en Amérique du Nord et en Europe. La coupe de récupération après feu a été étudiée plus fréquemment qu’après des épidémies d’insectes ou des tempêtes de vent. La plupart des études portaient sur la coupe après une seule perturbation et le nombre de répétitions de peuplements récupérés dépassait rarement 10. Les variables réponse les plus fréquentes étaient la régénération de la strate arborescente, le couvert végétal et les caractéristiques du bois mort. Ce document vise à aider les gestionnaires à trouver les études les plus pertinentes portant sur les effets écologiques de la coupe de récupération. Il vise aussi à identifier et examiner les points forts et les lacunes parmi l’ensemble des arguments pertinents pour les scientifiques qui cherchent à synthétiser les travaux antérieurs ou à identifier les sujets de futures études.

T1  - Overlapping Bark Beetle Outbreaks, Salvage Logging and Wildfire Restructure a Lodgepole Pine Ecosystem
AN  - 2026393774
AB  - The 2010 Church’s Park Fire burned beetle-killed lodgepole pine stands in Colorado, including recently salvage-logged areas, creating a fortuitous opportunity to compare the effects of salvage logging, wildfire and the combination of logging followed by wildfire. Here, we examine tree regeneration, surface fuels, understory plants, inorganic soil nitrogen and water infiltration in uncut and logged stands, outside and inside the fire perimeter. Subalpine fir recruitment was abundant in uncut, unburned, beetle-killed stands, whereas lodgepole pine recruitment was abundant in cut stands. Logging roughly doubled woody fuel cover and halved forb and shrub cover. Wildfire consumed all conifer seedlings in uncut and cut stands and did not stimulate new conifer regeneration within four years of the fire. Aspen regeneration, in contrast, was relatively unaffected by logging or burning, alone or combined. Wildfire also drastically reduced cover of soil organic horizons, fine woody fuels, graminoids and shrubs relative to unburned, uncut areas; moreover, the compound effect of logging and wildfire was generally similar to wildfire alone. This case study documents scarce conifer regeneration but ample aspen regeneration after a wildfire that occurred in the later stage of a severe beetle outbreak. Salvage logging had mixed effects on tree regeneration, understory plant and surface cover and soil nitrogen, but neither exacerbated nor ameliorated wildfire effects on those resources.

T1  - Assessing vulnerabilities and adapting to climate change in northwestern U.S. forests
AN  - 1993571685
AB  - Multiple climate change vulnerability assessments in the Pacific Northwest region of the USA provide the scientific information needed to begin adaptation in forested landscapes. Adaptation options developed by resource managers in conjunction with these assessments, newly summarized in the Climate Change Adaptation Library of the Western United States, provide an extensive choice of peer-reviewed climate-smart management strategies and tactics. More adaptation options are available for vegetation than for any other resource category, allowing vegetation management to be applied across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Good progress has been made in strategic development and planning for climate change adaptation in the Northwest, although on-the-ground implementation is in the early stages. However, recent regulatory mandates plus the increasing occurrence of extreme events (drought, wildfires, insect outbreaks) provide motivation to accelerate the adaptation process in planning and management on federal lands and beyond. Timely implementation of adaptation and collaboration across boundaries will help ensure the functionality of Northwest forests at broad spatial scales in a warmer climate.

T1  - Savanna Restoration Using Fire Benefits Birds Utilizing Dead Trees, Up to a Point
AN  - 1993302194
AB  - The decline of savanna habitat in the upper Midwest has resulted in a decline of savanna and grassland birds. Many savanna restoration efforts involve the re- introduction of fire, a method which kills fire-sensitive trees, often leaving them standing as snags. The purpose of this study was to assess how the number of snags (standing dead trees) is associated with the breeding bird community and to document how the number of snags at a site varied over a 23 y period of restoration by fire. The effect of snags on bird communities was studied by establishing bird census plots along a wide range of snag abundances. To determine for what purposes birds utilized snags, observers documented all visits during an hour-long period for pairs of a dead and live tree. Change in the abundance of snags over tíme was documented over 23 y in a 16 ha grid. We found both bird species richness and abundance were positively associated with the number of snags and that birds used dead trees for mating and reproductive purposes more than live trees. We found the introduction of fire for restoration purposes initially resulted in an increase in the number of snags, but repeated fires eventually caused the number of snags to decline substantially. If a primary goal of savanna restoration is to enhance breeding bird community, our results show how burn regimes can be managed to maximize the number of dead tree snags for as long as possible.

T1  - Effects of rangeland management on survival of female greater prairie‐chickens
AN  - 1973843661
AB  - Identifying relationships between habitat selection and population processes is important for habitat management and wildlife conservation. For prairie‐obligate species, space use and demography in extant grasslands are influenced by habitat conditions caused by rangeland management practices associated with livestock production. Greater prairie‐chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) are an indicator species for native tallgrass prairie ecosystems, but populations have declined in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas, USA because of intensification of rangeland management practices, including annual prescribed fire and high stocking densities. Patch‐burn grazing is a rotational system that provides heterogeneous habitats and can improve productivity of grassland birds, but the effects of grazing systems on habitat use or survival of greater prairie‐chickens are unknown. We used 3 types of survival analyses to investigate impacts of rangeland management on female greater prairie‐chickens in the central Flint Hills during 2011–2013: Kaplan–Meier models and Cox proportional hazards to examine factors affecting annual survival rates, hazard functions to assess seasonal patterns of mortality, and Andersen–Gill models to explore the links between habitat selection and cause‐specific mortality risk. Females captured at properties managed with patch‐burn grazing had annual survival rates (0.61 ± 0.07 SE) that were 35% higher than females on properties managed with annual burning and intensive early cattle stocking (0.45 ± 0.06). Moreover, females that selected habitats associated with intensive management had increased mortality risk and were particularly vulnerable to avian predators, whereas females that selected habitats created by patch‐burn grazing experienced lower overall mortality risk but were more vulnerable to mammalian predators. Overall mortality risk was significantly reduced under patch‐burn grazing management, and widespread implementation of annual spring burning and intensive early stocking is likely depressing survival of greater prairie‐chickens in the Flint Hills ecoregion. Our results join a growing body of evidence that patch‐burn grazing can provide higher quality grassland habitats for native wildlife species than current rangeland management associated with intensive cattle production. © 2017 The Wildlife Society

T1  - Valuation of terrestrial and marine biodiversity losses caused by forest wildfires
AN  - 1999642608
AB  - This study presents an economic valuation survey to estimate the social demand of a convenience sample for undertaking forest management measures aimed at reducing the negative impact of forest fires on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The paper spans the traditional focus in forest economics by considering also the negative effects caused by forest fires in coastal areas, highlighting this way how the externalities go beyond the terrestrial area and can also affect marine ecosystems. Results from a willingness to pay in space modelling approach show that people are sensitive to the biodiversity losses produced by forest fires and are willing to pay (work on a voluntary basis) to undertake activities that reduce their impact. The main negative externalities are concerned to the terrestrial wildlife (animals and vegetation), following by the erosion and marine biodiversity losses and the pests and diseases prevention.

T1  - Living in a burned landscape: woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) use of postfire residual patches for calving in a high fire – low anthropogenic Boreal Shield ecozone
AN  - 1988894864
AB  - Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) calculated that 55% of Saskatchewan's Boreal Shield has been disturbed by wildfire in the last 40 years. The 2012 Canadian Federal Recovery Strategy for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) states that these large-scale natural disturbances can cause caribou to cease use of portions of their range. This assumption neglects the potential habitat value of postfire residuals. We tested this assumption using 2 years of GPS data obtained from 56 female caribou to identify calving site selection. Seventy-nine calving events were identified from 91 individual calving seasons. For both calving and postcalving periods, woodland caribou preferred nonburned (>40 years) over burned habitats (≤40 years). Within burned areas, residual patches dominated by bogs-fens were preferred, indicating that burns with residuals are important woodland caribou calving habitat. The residuals may act as island refuges providing food-security, while surrounding burns provide reduced visual obstruction from which caribou can detect approaching predators. Although more data are necessary to make robust conclusions, this study provides novel insight into the ecological interactions of forest fires with woodland caribou in northern Saskatchewan, and offers important considerations regarding critical habitat identification and range-level planning to ensure all suitable caribou habitats are identified.

T1  - Ground-dwelling arthropod response to fire and clearcutting in jack pine: implications for ecosystem management
AN  - 1986339599
AB  - We tested the response of species composition of three dominant litter-dwelling arthropod taxa (carabid beetles, spiders, and rove beetles) to wildfire and harvest. This study was conducted in north-central Ontario (47°42'N, 83°36'W) in jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) dominated stands in 2013 using pitfall trapping. Using 222 species (12 015 individuals), we compared the effects of disturbance using recently burned (3 years since fire) and clearcut sites (3 years since harvest; tree length, full tree, stump removal, and blading), as well as older, closed-canopy stands that have regenerated following clearcutting (51 years since harvest) and fire (92 years since fire), with multivariate regression trees. Taxa were more similar in the three controls (including recent fire) than between controls and harvest treatments, with increased forest floor disturbance in harvested plots being a likely explanation. In addition, taxa were different in the younger (51 years) harvest-origin plots than in the older (92 years) fire-origin plots, suggesting that communities had not yet recovered from the harvest disturbance possibly due to insufficient coarse woody debris in the younger stand. These results indicate that forest management practices that match natural forest floor disturbance could ameliorate short-term effects, whereas the maintenance of more coarse woody debris could reduce the recovery time of epigaeic communities.

We explored the influence of environmental factors (precipitation, topography, geology, hydrology and waterhole density) and historical land use in the Tsavo ecosystem bushland. We mapped vegetation patterns in the region using remote sensing, GIS and field data and tested relationships with physical factors. We used regression analysis to explore the interaction of physical factors and human influence by including a protected and a nonprotected area, representing contrasting historical land use policies, as factors in the regression model. Bushland vegetation had the largest proportion in the region as a whole, but its proportion was notably greater in the nonprotected area. Precipitation, elevation, geology and historical land use were significant predictors of vegetation patterns in the regression models. Higher precipitation and elevation make woody plants superior competitors over grasses, resulting in predominance of bushland in such areas. Geologically, marine deposits result in shallow calcareous soils that favour grasses over trees, hence, absence of bushland. Wildlife management policies such as providing water for wildlife, protective boundaries and controlling wildfires influence distribution of wildlife and result in conditions that prevent regeneration and recruitment of trees.RésuméLa brousse est un type de végétation qui se compose d'une dense couverture de plantes ligneuses et d'un sous-étage herbeux. Nous avons étudié l'influence de facteurs environnementaux (précipitations, topographie, géologie, hydrologie et densité des points d'eau) et de l'utilisation traditionnelle des sols dans l'écosystème de brousse du Tsavo. Nous avons cartographié les schémas de la végétation de la région par télédétection, SIG et données de terrain et nous en avons testé les relations avec des facteurs physiques. Nous avons employé une analyse de régression pour rechercher l'interaction de facteurs physiques et de l'influence humaine en incluant une zone protégée et une zone non protégée représentant des historiques contrastés de politiques d'utilisation des sols comme facteurs dans le modèle de régression. La végétation de brousse constitue la plus grande proportion dans l'ensemble de la région, mais sa proportion est particulièrement plus élevée dans la zone non protégée. Les précipitations, l'élévation, la géologie et l'utilisation traditionnelle des sols étaient des indicateurs importants de schémas de végétation dans les modèles de régression. Des précipitations et une élévation supérieures font des plantes ligneuses des compétiteurs supérieurs aux graminées, ce qui aboutit à la prédominance de la brousse dans ce genre d'endroits. Géologiquement, des dépôts marins donnent des sols calcaires peu profonds qui favorisent davantage les herbes, d'où l'absence de broussailles. Les politiques en matière de gestion de la faune sauvage, telles que l'apport d'eau pour les animaux, des limites protectrices et le contrôle des feux, influencent la distribution de la faune et aboutissent à des conditions qui empêchent la régénération et le recrutement des arbres.

T1  - Forest restoration as a double-edged sword: the conflict between biodiversity conservation and pest control
AN  - 1963788326
AB  - Summary
Forestry has markedly changed a large proportion of the world's boreal forests, often with negative effects on biodiversity. As a result, forest restoration is increasingly implemented to counteract the negative effects. However, restoration measures aimed at mimicking natural disturbance regimes could simultaneously increase the risk of unwanted negative effects, such as damage by forest pest species. This study compares the effect of two restoration methods (prescribed burning and gap-cutting), on both biodiversity conservation and pest control, to provide a basis for solutions to this potential conflict.
Bark beetles are ideal for studying this conflict, as this group is both species-rich and contains notorious pest species. We conducted a unique, large-scale field experiment in which we compared the effect of two different restoration methods on the abundance, species richness and assemblage composition of bark beetles. In addition, we estimated uncontrolled tree mortality by the number of trees that died post-restoration.
Beetles were divided in two groups, primary and secondary, the former with an ability to kill growing trees. Bark beetle diversity did not differ between treatment groups prior to restoration. However, after restoration, assemblage composition and primary bark beetle abundance differed between the treatments. Furthermore, species richness was higher in burned and gap-cut stands compared to reference stands.
The number of trees that died post-restoration was highest on burned sites, whereas no difference was found between gap-cut and reference stands. The number of dead trees was correlated with the number of primary beetles.
Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the potential for a conflict between forest restoration for biodiversity conservation and the potential risk for tree mortality caused by forest pests. This is likely to become a problem in many boreal forests; however, our results suggest that this conflict can be moderated by the choice of restoration method. The restoration method gap-cutting had a similar positive impact on bark beetle species richness as compared to the burning method, but did not as burning, increase tree mortality. Thus, in areas where there is an apparent risk for pest outbreaks, our data suggest that gap-cutting should be the chosen method to avoid an unwanted increase in tree mortality at the stand level.

T1  - Species and functional trait re-assembly of ground beetle communities in restored grasslands
AN  - 1963351203
AB  - Ecosystem restoration provides unique opportunities to study community dynamics under succession and can reveal how consumer communities re-assemble and respond to successional changes. Studying community dynamics from both taxonomic and functional trait perspectives also may provide more robust assessments of restoration progress or success and allow cross-system comparisons. We studied ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) communities for three years in a restored grassland chronosequence with sites from 0 to 28 years old. We measured traditional community metrics (abundance, richness, Shannon diversity) and functional trait metrics based on species’ body length, wing morphology, activity time, phenology, and diet. Communities had high species richness and abundance in early successional stages, but these declined in later stages to low levels comparable to an adjacent grassland remnant. Species composition also shifted with time, converging with the remnant. Although functional richness, like species richness, declined as succession progressed, functional divergence quickly increased and was maintained over time, suggesting niche differentiation in established communities. Young sites were typified by small, macropterous, phytophagous species, while older sites contained larger species more likely to be flightless and carnivorous. Prescribed burns also affected traits, decreasing prevalence of larger species. This study demonstrates that functionally diverse consumer communities can self-assemble under restoration practices. In a relatively short amount of time both morphological and trophic level diversity are established. However, prescribed fire intended to control non-desirable plants may also shape beetle community functional composition, and restoration managers should consider if plant community benefits of fire outweigh potential declines in consumer function.

T1  - A POPULATION OF LYCHNOPHORA ERICOIDES MART. (ARNICA) (ASTERACEAE) IS PRONE TO EXTINCTION IN A SAVANNA OF CENTRAL BRAZIL
AN  - 1970347139
AB  - Lychnophora ericoides Mart. (Asteraceae), popularly known as arnica, is a plant species subjected to non-timber forest products extraction. Evidence is mounting that some local populations are on the brink of extinction. However, demographic studies of Lychnophora ericoides are rare. Therefore, as a step towards conservation, a remnant population of Lychnophora ericoides located in an area of the Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) in Central Brazil was evaluated from 2010 through 2014. Disturbances such as wildfires and harvesting of Lychnophora ericoides were randomly distributed throughout the study period in this area. Four annual transition matrices (A1, A2, A3 and A4) were constructed, based on life stages. The main results of studies of population dynamics for this species are as follows: 1) population growth rates ([...]) with 95% confidence intervals indicated a declining population in all periods from 2010 to 2014; 2) stochastic population growth rate considering the four matrices was < 1 with value [...]= 0.358 and CI95% = (0.354-0.362); 3) survival with permanence at the same stage of reproductive adult individuals (46-80%) contributed most to population growth rate, based on elasticity analysis; 4) the population is much less likely to have increases in density, compared with reduction, for all intervals from 2010 to 2014, based on transient indices; 5) the low value of [...]in the high-mortality year was caused by lower stasis of individuals in the seedling or sapling and juvenile life stages, as well as fecundity in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 intervals, as shown by a life table response experiment; and 6) 100% of the population will probably be extinct within 15 years. There is evidence that the main cause for local extinction of Lychnophora ericoides could be the effects of frequent wildfires. Based on these results, it is suggested that the time has come for significant conservation efforts to rescue this population, including monitoring, protection and education as the first steps towards protection of this vulnerable plant species.

T1  - Where do animals come from during post-fire population recovery? Implications for ecological and genetic patterns in post-fire landscapes
AN  - 1953936766
AB  - Identifying where animals come from during population recovery can help to understand the impacts of disturbance events and regimes on species distributions and genetic diversity. Alternative recovery processes for animal populations affected by fire include external recolonization, nucleated recovery from refuges, or in situ survival and population growth. We used simulations to develop hypotheses about ecological and genetic patterns corresponding to these alternative models. We tested these hypotheses in a study of the recovery of two small mammals, the Australian bush rat and the agile antechinus, after a large (> 50 000 ha), severe wildfire. 
The abundance of both species was severely reduced by fire and recovered to near or above pre-fire levels within two generations, yet we rejected a hypothesis of recovery by external recolonization. While the agile antechinus showed genetic evidence for far greater dispersal capacity than the bush rat, neither species showed gradients in abundance or genetic diversity with distance from unburnt forest during population recovery. 
Population recovery was driven by local-scale processes. However, the mechanisms differed between species, resulting from the spatial impacts of fire on habitat suitability. Agile antechinus populations recovered through population growth from in situ survivors. The bush rat followed a model of nucleated recovery, involving local recolonization from micro-refuges in topographic drainage lines. 
Nucleated recovery by the bush rat was associated with changes in dispersal, and fine-scale patterns of genetic admixture. We identified increased dispersal by females during recovery, contrasting with male-biased dispersal in unburnt forest. Such flexibility in dispersal can potentially increase recovery rates compared to expectations based on dispersal behavior within undisturbed populations. 
Our study shows how the initial distribution of survivors, determined by fire effects on resource distribution, determines the subsequent scaling of population recovery patterns, and the sensitivity of population distribution and genetic diversity to changing disturbance regimes.

T1  - Response by vertical strata to catastrophic wind in restored Pinus palustris stands
AN  - 1962250172
AB  - Pinus palustris Mill. (longleaf pine) ecosystems support a diversity of rare plants and animals, but have been substantially degraded by historical human impacts. A suite of natural disturbances influence development and succession in P. palustris ecosystems, ranging from frequent, low-intensity events such as surface fires to infrequent, catastrophic events such as hurricanes. Like hurricanes, tornadoes may produce catastrophic winds that create canopy openings necessary for regeneration of P. palustris and other shade-intolerant species. Despite their pervasiveness in some P. palustris ecosystems, we know relatively little about the impacts of tornadoes. Our study, conducted July-August 2015 in fire-restored P. palustris stands of the Alabama Fall Line Hills, applied a nested sampling design to compare dead trees, live trees, saplings, seedlings, and herbaceous plants in plots either undisturbed or directly impacted by an Enhanced Fujita scale 3 tornado on April 27, 2011. Most wind-killed trees were uprooted or snapped, and consisted primarily of large P. palustris stems. Pinus palustris persisted, however, with increased relative densities in the tree, sapling, and seedling strata of wind-disturbed neighborhoods. The relative densities of Quercus L. (oak) trees and saplings also increased. Combined with an herbaceous stratum composition typical of other restored P. palustris stands, desirable woody species recovery indicated that the stands surveyed here were resilient to the 2011 tornado. Contrary to expectations, the tornado reduced woody stem diversity and herbaceous cover. These results may serve as a benchmark for tracking species-specific changes in P. palustris communities and guide management decisions, including those designed to promote native forest diversity.

T1  - Optimal prescribed burn frequency to manage foundation California perennial grass species and enhance native flora
AN  - 1943819072
AB  - Grasslands can be diverse assemblages of grasses and forbs but not much is known how perennial grass species management affects native plant diversity except in a few instances. We studied the use of late-spring prescribed burns over a span of 11 years where the perennial grass Poa secunda was the foundation species, with four additional years of measurements after the final burn. We evaluated burn effects on P. secunda, the rare native annual forb Amsinckia grandiflora and local native and exotic species. Annual burning maintained P. secunda number, resulted in significant expansion, the lowest thatch and exotic grass cover, the highest percentage of bare ground, but also the lowest native forb and highest exotic forb cover. Burning approximately every 3 years maintained a lower number of P. secunda plants, allowed for expansion, and resulted in the highest native forb cover with a low exotic grass cover. Burning approximately every 5 years and the control (burned once from a wildfire) resulted in a decline in P. secunda number, the highest exotic grass and thatch cover and the lowest percentage of bare ground. P. secunda numbers were maintained up to 4 years after the final burn. While local native forbs benefited from burning approximately every 3 years, planted A. grandiflora performed best in the control treatment. A. grandiflora did not occur naturally at the site; therefore, no seed bank was present to provide across-year protection from the effects of the burns. Thus, perennial grass species management must also consider other native species life history and phenology to enhance native flora diversity.

T1  - Human-modified habitats facilitate forest-dwelling populations of an invasive predator, <i>Vulpes vulpes</i>
AN  - 1955458197
AB  - Invasive and over-abundant predators pose a major threat to biodiversity and often benefit from human activities. Effective management requires understanding predator use of human-modified habitats (including resource subsidies and disturbed environments), and individual variation within populations. We investigated selection for human-modified habitats by invasive red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, within two predominantly forested Australian landscapes. We predicted that foxes would select for human-modified habitats in their range locations and fine-scale movements, but that selection would vary between individuals. We GPS-tracked 19 foxes for 17–166 days; ranges covered 33 to >2500 ha. Approximately half the foxes selected for human-modified habitats at the range scale, with some ‘commuting’ more than five kilometres to farmland or townships at night. Two foxes used burnt forest intensively after a prescribed fire. In their fine-scale nocturnal movements, most foxes selected for human-modified habitats such as reservoirs, forest edges and roads, but there was considerable individual variation. Native fauna in fragmented and disturbed habitats are likely to be exposed to high rates of fox predation, and anthropogenic food resources may subsidise fox populations within the forest interior. Coordinating fox control across land-tenures, targeting specific landscape features, and limiting fox access to anthropogenic resources will be important for biodiversity conservation.

T1  - The early response of subtropical tussock grasslands to restoration treatments
AN  - 1942053218
AB  - Once widespread, Australia's bluegrass tussock grasslands (dominated by Dichanthium sp.) of the Queensland Central Highlands are now severely endangered. Despite being biodiversity rich and highly valued as low input, nutrient-dense grazing systems, bluegrass tussock grasslands have suffered extensive clearing and degradation over the last 150 years. Natural recovery of these grasslands is possible but rates of recovery are slow. As such, there is an urgent need to assess practical management strategies to accelerate recovery of these grasslands, with a particular focus on early-successional stages, when aggressive exotic species are most prevalent. To date, no studies have tested whether commonly used grassland restoration strategies can enhance early-successional stages and accelerate regeneration in this system. Here, we examine the early short-term impacts (first two seasons) of two common grassland restoration approaches, with two variations each: direct seeding (single species and low seed diversity) and vegetation clearing (prescribed burning and glyphosate application) across two common starting points: a formerly cropped old field and a historically overgrazed natural grassland. No treatment increased native diversity (Shannon's or richness) in plots but the composition of burned plots in the old field did become more similar to healthy reference sites after two seasons. Burning combined with direct seeding also increased the abundance of the dominant grass, Dichanthium sericeum, toward healthy reference levels within the first two seasons post seeding. This study provides a practical assessment of the short-term impacts and capacity of common grassland restoration treatments to enhance the recovery of Australia's tussock grassland systems.

T1  - Working to Address Complex Forest Issues: A Collaborative Case Study between the Mescalero Apache Nation and USDA Forest Service
AN  - 1938823754
AB  - Hays discusses a unique collaboration between the Mescalero Apache Nation and the US Forest Service. In the Southwest United States, tribal lands are often juxtaposed within a landscape of public lands and common ecological issues occur across boundaries; in the south-central mountains of New Mexico, the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation is directly adjacent to the Lincoln National Forest. Throughout the Southwest, a recent increase in large-scale high-severity wildfires in or adjacent to the wildland-urban interface has brought attention to the need for improved forest restoration efforts on both tribal and federally managed lands. The Sacramento Mountains of south-central New Mexico are home to a dense population of Mexican spotted owls (MSOs), a federally threatened species. MSOs have proven to be a driver of forest management activities in the Southwest since their original listing under the Endangered Species Act in 1993. Successful collaborations in land management are dependent on many factors. Perhaps most important is an identified need to work toward a common goal. A support framework such as the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program can bring previously discordant groups to the table to foster trust building.

T1  - Disturbance and chronic levels of cortisol in boreal woodland caribou
AN  - 1932734497
AB  - Disturbance by anthropogenic activities may cause chronic (long-term) stress in wildlife and contribute to population declines. Although declines of boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) across Canada have been attributed to anthropogenic disturbance, the physiological stress response of caribou to disturbance is not well understood. As a measure of chronic stress, we assessed cortisol concentrations in guard hair from 89 female caribou between 2009 and 2011 in eastern Manitoba. We compared cortisol concentrations among 5 caribou populations occupying areas with varying levels of disturbance, and estimated home ranges of 55 collared caribou to examine how home range size varied with cortisol concentrations. Within each home range, we quantified disturbance characteristics (roads, transmission lines, cottages, and logged and burned areas) and landscape features (lakes, black spruce [Picea mariana], and jack pine [Pinus banksiana]), and used model selection to determine the combination of disturbance features that best explained variation in caribou cortisol concentrations. Hair cortisol concentrations differed among the 5 caribou populations and increased with decreasing home range size. The proportion of the home range logged in the previous 6-21 years best explained variation in cortisol concentrations. Our results suggest that caribou respond negatively to logging, and caribou occupying the southern extent of their range could be vulnerable to disturbance. Although disturbance affects caribou cortisol concentrations, the consequences of increased cortisol concentrations on caribou survival and reproduction are unknown and need to be examined for effective management of populations. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. 
We evaluated the effects of disturbance on chronic levels of cortisol in boreal woodland caribou, and found that cortisol levels increased with increasing logging disturbance and decreasing home ranges. Minimizing logging and other anthropogenic disturbance, particularly from the southern extent of the caribou's range, could reduce cortisol levels in caribou.

T1  - Accommodating Mixed-Severity Fire to Restore and Maintain Ecosystem Integrity with a Focus on the Sierra Nevada of California, USA
AN  - 2409020351
AB  - Existing fire policy encourages the maintenance of ecosystem integrity in fire management, yet this is difficult to implement on lands managed for competing economic, human safety, and air quality concerns. We discuss a fire management approach in the mid-elevations of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, that may exemplify similar challenges in other fire-adapted regions of the western USA. We also discuss how managing for pyrodiversity through mixed-severity fires can promote ecosystem integrity in Sierran mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws) forests. To illustrate, we show how coarse-filter (landscape-level) and complementary fine-filter (species-level) approaches can enhance forest management and conservation biology objectives as related to wildfire management. At the coarse-filter level, pyrodiverse mixed-severity fires provide landscape heterogeneity. Species and ecosystem characteristics associated with pyrodiversity can be maintained or enhanced by accommodating moderately severe fires, which hasten restoration by recreating a complex vegetation mosaic otherwise at risk from suppression. At the fine-filter level, managers can select focal species and species of conservation concern based on the degree to which those species depend on fire and accommodate their specific conservation needs. The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus [Swainson, 1832]) is an ideal focal species for monitoring the ecological integrity of forests restored through mixed-severity fire, and the California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis [Xantus de Vesey, 1860]) is a species of conservation concern that uses post-fire habitat mosaics and is particularly vulnerable to logging. We suggest a comprehensive approach that integrates wildland fire for ecosystem integrity and species viability with strategic deployment of fire suppression and ecologically based restoration of pyrodiverse landscapes. Our approach would accomplish fire management goals while simultaneously maintaining biodiversity.

The increasing rarity of these ecosystems combined with conservation concerns for savanna-associated species such as the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly have resulted in a growing interest in oak savanna restoration and management. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of several different savanna restoration approaches using an operational-scale restoration experiment established in 2008 and 2009 on the Huron-Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan. We compared three mechanical thinning approaches (bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter) in conjunction with prescribed burning and native seed treatments. Our results suggest that among mechanical thinning approaches, the shear cutter was the most effective for promoting management goals of higher herbaceous plant cover, higher wild lupine cover, reduced woody plant cover, and lower invasive species cover. Postestablishment prescribed burning appears to be effective for furthering these management goals by reducing woody plant cover and creating more exposed soil for plant colonization. Seeding treatments further promoted desired cover types, while minimizing undesired cover types. The results presented here highlight some important differences among several common restoration approaches that may prove useful to practitioners interested in oak savanna restoration.

T1  - Large mammal species richness and late Quaternary precipitation change in south-western Australia: JQS
AN  - 1930666684
AB  - The precipitation history of south-west Australia since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) has important implications for understanding southern hemisphere climate dynamics. Previously reported environmental records indicating more open vegetation during the LGM have been interpreted in terms of aridity, but such changes can be explained by alternative mechanisms. To provide new evidence concerning the region's Quaternary precipitation history, we examine temporal changes in large mammal richness at four south-west Australian fossil sites: Devil's Lair, Tunnel Cave, Witchcliffe Rock Shelter and Rainbow Cave. Large mammal richness is correlated strongly with mean annual precipitation across 53 modern Australian communities. Extending this relationship to the fossil record, a steady increase in richness from the LGM to the onset of the Holocene at both Devil's Lair and Tunnel Cave is consistent with increased precipitation through time. This supports previous interpretations of a more arid LGM and implies regional heterogeneity in the position of the southern hemisphere westerlies. A reduction in richness during the last 1000 years is unlikely to be the result of precipitation change and may be related to more frequent burning of the landscape by hunter-gatherers in an effort to increase availability of large prey.

T1  - Identifying the source population of fish re-colonizing an arid-land stream following wildfire-induced extirpation using otolith microchemistry
AN  - 1912906910
AB  - Movement is necessary for re-colonization of habitats following disturbance, but methods to estimate dispersal of small-bodied fishes are limited. We evaluated the efficacy of otolith microchemistry in identifying habitat origin of longfin dace Agosia chrysogaster in the Gila River, NM, USA. Additionally, we used this method to determine the source population of speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus that re-colonized a tributary reach following wildfire-induced extirpation. We determined otolith microchemical analysis was possible after finding elevated ambient water concentrations of Mg, Mn, and Sr in the disturbed tributary both before and after wildfire relative to other source streams. These water chemistry differences allowed us to test if speckled dace were derived from downstream populations, or from those potentially persisting within refugia in the fire-affected tributary. We found that otolith signatures consistently reflected water chemistry patterns for Mn and Sr, allowing us to classify individuals to known capture locations 86% (range = 74-100%) of the time. Otolith microchemistry techniques then revealed that 88% of speckled dace that re-colonized the fire-affected tributary reach were derived from refuge populations within the tributary. Our results indicated that otolith microchemistry could be an important tool for characterizing re-colonization dynamics of fish populations residing in chemically heterogeneous stream networks.

T1  - Is Resilience the New Sustainability?
AN  - 1921683953
AB  - As wildfires continue to grow larger and more intense, tree mortality from insects and disease becomes neartotal over increasingly large forest areas, and forests in the Sierra Nevada and across the western US succumb to drought and heat, forest scientists and resource managers are asking themselves: Is "sustainability" still a feasible guiding principle and primary management goal? When people thought of forest ecosystem management in terms of sustainability, society debated over what resources and values forest managers should maintain and for whom. The subsequent refocusing on resilience has shifted the attention to managing risk and maintaining future options to the extent feasible. But to the extent that forest management actions are defined in detailed statutes, regulations, and other high-level policies, they tend to lag behind the best available current science.

T1  - Diverse habitat use during two life stages of the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi): community structure, foraging, and social interactions
AN  - 1953014645
AB  - Our ability to prevent extinction in declining populations often depends on effective management of habitats that are disturbed through wildfire, logging, agriculture, or development. In these disturbed landscapes, the juxtaposition of multiple habitat types can be especially important to fledglings and young birds, which may leave breeding grounds in human-altered habitat for different habitats nearby that provide increased foraging opportunities, reduced competition, and higher protection from predators. In this study, we evaluated the importance of three habitat types to two life stages of the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi), a synanthropic songbird endemic to Andros, The Bahamas. First, we determined the avian species composition and relative abundance of I. northropi among three major vegetation types on Andros: Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea) forest, coppice (broadleaf dry forest), and anthropogenic areas, dominated by nonnative vegetation (farmland and developed land). We then compared the foraging strategies and social interactions of two age classes of adult Bahama Orioles in relation to differential habitat use. Bird surveys late in the Bahama Oriole’s breeding season indicated the number of avian species and Bahama Oriole density were highest in coppice. Some bird species occurring in the coppice and pine forest were never observed in agricultural or residential areas, and may be at risk if human disturbance of pine forest and coppice increases, as is occurring at a rapid pace on Andros. During the breeding season, second-year (SY) adult Bahama Orioles foraged in all vegetation types, whereas after-second-year (ASY) adults were observed foraging only in anthropogenic areas, where the species nested largely in introduced coconut palms (Cocos nucifera). Additionally, SY adults foraging in anthropogenic areas were often observed with an ASY adult, suggesting divergent habitat use for younger, unpaired birds. Other aspects of foraging (vegetation features, food-gleaning behavior, and food items) were similar for the two age classes. Older Bahama Orioles exhibited relatively higher rates of social interactions (intraspecific and interspecific pooled) in anthropogenic areas, and won more interaction outcomes compared to younger adults. Our findings concur with those of other studies indicating dry broadleaf forest is vitally important to migrating, wintering, and resident birds, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole, which appears to depend heavily on this vegetation type during certain life stages.

T1  - Mite communities (Acari: Mesostigmata) in young and mature coniferous forests after surface wildfire
AN  - 1913622581
AB  - Density, diversity and assemblage structure of Mesostigmata (cohorts Gamasina and Uropodina) were investigated in Scots pine forests differing in forest age (young: 9-40 years and mature: 83-101 years) in which wildfire occurred. This animal group belongs to the dominant acarine predators playing a crucial role in soil food webs and being important as biological control agents. In total, six forests (three within young and three within mature stands) were inspected in Puszcza Knyszyska Forest Complex in May 2015. At each forest area, sampling was done from burned and adjacent control sites with steel cylinders for heat extraction of soil fauna. Data were analyzed statistically with nested ANOVA. We found a significant effect on mite density of both fire and forest age, with more mites in mature forests and control plots. In total, 36 mite taxa were identified. Mite diversity differed significantly between forest ages but not between burned versus control. Our study indicated that all studied forests are characterized by unique mite species and that the mite communities are dominated by different mite species depending on age forest and surface wildfire occurrence. Finally, canonical correspondence analysis ranked the mite assemblages from control mature, through burned young and burned mature, away from the control young.

T1  - Fire-induced negative nutritional outcomes for cattle when sharing habitat with native ungulates in an African savanna
AN  - 1897654005
AB  - Summary 
Prescribed burning is used in tropical savannas to improve habitat conditions for domestic and wild herbivores, but its effects on the ecological interactions between these herbivore guilds have never been assessed experimentally. Understanding such effects will contribute towards more informed management of both guilds in landscapes where they share habitats. 
We investigated the effects of burning on the nutritional outcomes for cattle sharing habitat with wildlife in a Kenyan savanna ecosystem. We compared forage availability and cattle forage and nutrient intake rates across burned and unburned areas cattle accessed exclusively, and those they shared with medium-sized wild ungulates, both with and without megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes). We performed these measurements in May 2013 (wet period, 2 months post-burning) and February 2014 (dry period, 11 months post-burning). Additionally, we monitored wildlife use of these areas. 
Prescribed burning enhanced cattle nutrition, but only in areas cattle did not share with wildlife. Shared foraging with wildlife reduced cattle forage and nutrient intake rates by 37-97% in burned areas (burns), but not in unburned areas; these reductions corresponded with reduced herbage availability in the shared burns. 
In May (the wet period), cattle met their nutrient intake requirements in burns, regardless of whether they were sharing these areas with wildlife. However, in February (the dry period), nutrient requirements were unmet or tended to be unmet in burns shared with wildlife; requirements were met or significantly exceeded in the unshared burns. 
Experimental exclusion of megaherbivores did not moderate these effects, suggesting that they were primarily caused by medium-sized wild ungulates which were highly attracted to burns. 
Synthesis and applications. Prescribed burning produces negative nutritional outcomes for cattle when sharing habitat with wild ungulates. Because these effects could negatively influence livestock-wildlife coexistence, burning should be applied prudently in such human-occupied savanna landscapes. Specifically, because unburned areas serve as refuge foraging areas during the dry season, interspersing burns with unburned areas could minimize fire-driven negative interactions between cattle and wild ungulates. Conversely, burning could be used to draw wildlife away from valuable cattle foraging areas, such as those near available water. 
Prescribed burning produces negative nutritional outcomes for cattle when sharing habitat with wild ungulates. Because these effects could negatively influence livestock-wildlife coexistence, burning should be applied prudently in such human-occupied savanna landscapes. Specifically, because unburned areas serve as refuge foraging areas during the dry season, interspersing burns with unburned areas could minimize fire-driven negative interactions between cattle and wild ungulates. Conversely, burning could be used to draw wildlife away from valuable cattle foraging areas, such as those near available water.

T1  - Non‐target impacts of weed control on birds, mammals, and reptiles
AN  - 2289924497
AB  - The impacts of invasive plant control on native animals are rarely evaluated. Using data from an eight‐year study in southeastern Australia, we quantified the effects on native bird, mammal, and reptile species of (1) the abundance of the invasive Bitou Bush, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata, and (2) a Bitou Bush control program, which involved repeated herbicide spraying interspersed with prescribed burning. We found that overall species richness of birds, mammals, and reptiles and the majority of individual vertebrate species were unresponsive to Bitou Bush cover and the number of plants. Two species including the nationally endangered Eastern Bristlebird (Dasyurus brachypterus) responded positively to measures of native vegetation cover following the control of Bitou Bush. Analyses of the effects of different components of the treatment protocol employed to control Bitou Bush revealed (1) no negative effects of spraying on vertebrate species richness; (2) negative effects of spraying on only one individual species (Scarlet Honeyeater); and (3) lower bird species richness but higher reptile species richness after fire. The occupancy of most individual vertebrates species was unaffected by burning; four species responded negatively and one positively to fire. Our study indicated that actions to remove Bitou Bush generally have few negative impacts on native vertebrates. We therefore suggest that controlling this highly invasive exotic plant species has only very limited negative impacts on vertebrate biota.

T1  - Divergent trends in ecosystem services under different climate-management futures in a fire-prone forest landscape
AN  - 1891693124
AB  - While ecosystem services and climate change are often examined independently, quantitative assessments integrating these fields are needed to inform future land management decisions. Using climate-informed state-and-transition simulations, we examined projected trends and tradeoffs for a suite of ecosystem services under four climate change scenarios and two management scenarios (active management emphasizing fuel treatments and no management other than fire suppression) in a fire-prone landscape of dry and moist mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon, USA. Focal ecosystem services included fire potential (regulating service), timber volume (provisioning service), and potential wildlife habitat (supporting service). Projections without climate change suggested active management in dry mixed-conifer forests would create more open forest structures, reduce crown fire potential, and maintain timber stocks, while in moist mixed-conifer forests, active management would reduce crown fire potential but at the expense of timber stocks. When climate change was considered, however, trends in most ecosystem services changed substantially, with large increases in wildfire area predominating broad-scale trends in outputs, regardless of management approach (e.g., strong declines in timber stocks and habitat for closed-forest wildlife species). Active management still had an influence under a changing climate, but as a moderator of the strong climate-driven trends rather than being a principal driver of ecosystem service outputs. These results suggest projections of future ecosystem services that do not consider climate change may result in unrealistic expectations of benefits.

T1  - A framework for modeling habitat quality in disturbance‐prone areas demonstrated with woodland caribou and wildfire
AN  - 2290791953
AB  - Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition, connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods, areas of very high‐ and poor‐quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of regions provide opportunities for long‐term management interventions. The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes. It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning.

T1  - Long-Term Impacts of Post-Fire Mulching on Ground-Dwelling Arthropod Communities in a Eucalypt Plantation
AN  - 1889683866
AB  - In the past decades, Portugal like several other Mediterranean countries has been affected by frequent wildfires. This has led to various field tests of post-fire soil conservation measures and, in particular, mulching with forest slash residues. While forest residue mulching was shown to be highly effective in reducing post-fire erosion, its side effects on soil fauna communities have not been studied and are also difficult to predict from the - scarce - literature on mulch effects in general. Therefore, this study compared the abundance, diversity and taxonomic and functional composition of the ground-dwelling arthropod communities of three mulched and, as control, three untreated erosion plots of roughly 100m2 that had been installed in a eucalypt plantation almost immediately after a wildfire in 2010, some five years earlier. This was done using three pitfall traps per plot, placed at the lower, middle and upper part of the study slope. Roughly five years after mulching, its impacts on the ground-dwelling arthropod were rather limited, especially compared to its effect on overall soil erosion rates. One of the few exceptions was the abundance of the Hymenoptera - one of the most frequently occurring orders - which was significantly lower in the mulched than control plots. This and other near significant mulching impacts found in this study plainly justify a follow-up study on short-term effects. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Unravelling the response of diurnal raptors to land use change in a highly dynamic landscape in northwestern Spain: an approach based on satellite earth observation data
AN  - 1880335509
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the main components of current anthropogenic global change. Unravelling the ecological response of biodiversity to the combined effect of land use change and other stressors is essential for effective conservation. For this purpose, we used co-inertia analysis to combine LULCC analysis of earth observation satellite data-derived maps and raptor data obtained from road censuses conducted in 2001 and 2014 at sampling unit level (10 km2 spatial resolution), in northwestern Spain (province of Ourense, c. 7281 km2). In addition, habitat suitability models were also computed using ten widely used single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions at landscape level (four spatial resolutions: 500-m, 1-km, 2-km and 5-km radius around each sighting) for each year and raptor species to analyse the habitat suitability changes in the whole study area through three niche overlap indices. The models revealed an increase in occurrence and habitat suitability of forest raptor species coupled with a strong decrease in species associated with open habitats, mainly heaths and shrub formations. Open-habitat specialist species were negatively affected by the concomitant effects of intensive forest management and a long-lasting trend of rural abandonment coupled with an unusually high frequency of wildfires. Sustainable forest management and agricultural practices should be encouraged by both public and private sectors, through, e.g. policies related to European funds for rural and regional development (FEDER and FEADER programs) to effectively protect threatened habitats and species, and to comply with current environmental legislation. The combined use of satellite imagery and ground-level biodiversity data proved to be a cost-effective and systematic method for monitoring priority habitats and their species in highly dynamic landscapes.

T1  - Are post-fire residual forest patches refugia for boreal bryophyte species? Implications for ecosystem based management and conservation
AN  - 1877046542
AB  - Residual patches of forest remaining after natural or anthropogenic disturbance may facilitate regeneration of fragmented forest. However, residual patch function remains unclear, especially after natural wildfire. We investigate the role of residual boreal forest patches as refugia for bryophytes and ask the question, do they house bryophyte communities similar to those encountered in undisturbed forests? Bryophytes were sampled in three habitat types in black spruce boreal forests illustrating a gradient of disturbance severity: undisturbed forests, residual patches and burned matrices. Temporal, disturbance severity, spatial and structural variables of habitats were also recorded. Bryophyte community composition differed among habitat types with residual patches characterized by higher species richness, the loss of forest specialists and the addition of disturbance-prone species. The bryophyte community found in residual patches is at the interface between the communities of undisturbed forests and burned matrices. As residual patches did not conserve all species, particularly forest specialists, they were not refugia. However, we identify temporal, spatial and structural characteristics that can maintain bryophyte communities most similar to undisturbed forests and enhance residual patch "refugia potential". Residual patches enhance bryophyte diversity of the landscape housing species that cannot survive in the burned matrix. As conclusion we discuss the use of retention patches in harvested stands, together with the preservation of undisturbed stands that house singular bryophyte communities and especially sensitive forest specialists.

T1  - Evaluating future success of whitebark pine ecosystem restoration under climate change using simulation modeling
AN  - 1874261891
AB  - Major declines of whitebark pine forests throughout western North America from the combined effects of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, fire exclusion policies, and the exotic disease white pine blister rust (WPBR) have spurred many restoration actions. However, projected future warming and drying may further exacerbate the species' decline and possibly compromise long-term success of today's restoration activities. We evaluated successes of restoration treatments under future climate using a comprehensive landscape simulation experiment. The spatially explicit, ecological process model FireBGCv2 was used to simulate whitebark pine populations on two U.S. Northern Rocky Mountain landscapes over 95 years under two climate, three restoration, and two fire management scenarios. Major findings were that (1) whitebark pine can remain on some high mountain landscapes in a future climate albeit at lower basal areas (50% decrease), (2) restoration efforts, such as thinning and prescribed burning, are vital to ensure future whitebark pine forests, and (3) climate change impacts on whitebark pine vary by local setting. Whitebark pine restoration efforts will mostly be successful in the future but only if future populations are somewhat resistant to WPBR. Results were used to develop general guidelines that address climate change impacts for planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating fine-scale restoration activities.

T1  - Space Use of Female Greater Prairie-Chickens in Response to Fire and Grazing Interactions
AN  - 1869955203
AB  - Ecological interactions between fire and grazing have shaped the evolutionary history of grassland ecosystems. Currently, grassland birds have experienced ongoing population declines, following widespread implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that reduce habitat heterogeneity. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative rangeland management strategy that promotes habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr. field study in the central Flint Hills of Kansas to compare the spatial ecology of female Greater Prairie-Chickens(Tympanuchus cupido)in rangelands managed with intensive rangeland management versus patch-burn grazing. This is the first study on the effects of patch-burn grazing on the space use decisions of Greater Prairie-Chickens at the home range scale. We used seasonal estimates of home range for 6-mo breeding and nonbreeding periods, as well as resource utilization functions to investigate the response of female prairie chickens to landscape metrics describing fire, grazing, and proximity to anthropogenic structures or lek sites. In our analysis of all radio-marked females, distance to lek was consistently the strongest predictor of space use during both breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing selected areas with low stocking rates and high fire frequencies, and they avoided recently burned areas. Our study provides new evidence that patch-burn grazing can improve grassland habitat for Greater Prairie-Chickens, an umbrella species in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem. Patch-burn grazing created preferred habitats for female Greater Prairie-Chickens, with a relatively frequent fire return interval, a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, and a reduced stocking rate in unburned areas avoided by grazers. Widespread implementation of patch-burn grazing could result in significant improvements in habitat quality for wildlife in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.

T1  - Response of Northern Bobwhite Movements to Management-Driven Disturbance in a Shrub-Dominated Ecosystem
AN  - 1869951295
AB  - Despite inhabiting fire-adapted grasslands and shrublands across much of their continental distribution, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus,hereafter bobwhite) behavior relative to disturbance (e.g., fire) is poorly understood, especially in the western fringe of their distribution. We assessed bobwhite movement and space use following dormant season burning (January-March 2013-2014) in a sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii,hereafter shinnery oak) plant community. We captured and radio-marked bobwhites (n= 369) and monitored them via radiotelemetry across burn treatments (averaging 254 ha) ranging from 0 to 12, 13 to 24, 25 to 36, and >36 months post fire (hereafter, time since fire [TSF]) at the Packsaddle Wildlife Management Area in western Oklahoma, United States. Mean covey home range size was 76.6 ha ± 5.9 [SE] (range; 12-270 ha) (n= 61 coveys), which is substantially larger than covey home ranges reported for other regions. Prescribed fire affected space use of coveys (F4, 54= 2.95,P< 0.05), which was driven by smaller home range sizes of coveys using 25-36 TSF (52.07 ha [± 6.6]) than 0-12 (85.0 ha [± 15.53]), 13-24 (86.7 ha [± 20.7]) and > 36 TSF (78.9 ha [± 6.54]). Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that neither spring dispersal (movements or area traversed) were correlated with TSF, age, or sex (n= 114), further demonstrating a minimal effect of prescribed fire; however, dispersal areas were greater in 2013 than in 2014 (P< 0.05). Our research shows that prescribed fire applied at a landscape scale had limited effects on short-term bobwhite movement and space use. These findings also suggest that in shinnery oak vegetation communities land managers can use prescribed fire across large spatial extents without substantially altering the space use or movement of bobwhites.

T1  - Diverse habitat use during two life stages of the critically Endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi): Community structure, foraging, and social interactions
AN  - 1953641562
AB  - Our ability to prevent extinction in declining populations often depends on effective management of habitats that are disturbed through wildfire, logging, agriculture, or development. In these disturbed landscapes, the juxtaposition of multiple habitat types can be especially important to fledglings and young birds, which may leave breeding grounds in human-altered habitat for different habitats nearby that provide increased foraging opportunities, reduced competition, and higher protection from predators. In this study, we sought to better understand the importance of habitat diversity to two life stages of the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (  Icterus northropi  ), a synanthropic songbird endemic to Andros, The Bahamas. First, we determined the avian species composition and relative abundance of the oriole among three major vegetation types on Andros: Caribbean pine (  Pinus caribaea  ) forest, coppice (broadleaf dry forest), and anthropogenic areas, dominated by nonnative vegetation (farmland and developed land). We then compared the foraging strategies and social interactions of two age classes of adult orioles in relation to differential habitat use. Bird surveys late in the oriole’s breeding season indicated avian s pecies richness and oriole density were highest in coppice. Some bird species occurring in the coppice and pine forest were never observed in agricultural or residential areas, and may be at risk if human disturbance of pine forest and coppice increases, as is occurring at a rapid pace on Andros. During the breeding season, second-year (SY) adult orioles foraged in all vegetation types, whereas after-second-year (ASY) adults were observed foraging only in anthropogenic areas, where the species nested largely in introduced coconut palms (  Cocos nucifera  ). Additionally, SY adults foraging in anthropogenic areas were often observed with an ASY adult, suggesting divergent habitat use for younger, unpaired birds. Other aspects of foraging (vegetation features, food-gleaning behavior, and food items) were similar for the two age classes. Older orioles exhibited relatively higher rates of social interactions (intraspecific and interspecific pooled) in anthropogenic areas, and won more interaction outcomes compared to youngeradults. Our findings concur with those of other studies indicating dry broadleaf forest is vitally important to migrating, wintering, and resident birds, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole, which appears to depend heavily on this vegetation type during certain life stages.

T1  - The implications of succession after fire for the conservation management of moorland invertebrate assemblages
AN  - 1884771645
AB  - Fire management in protected areas requires an understanding of the consequences of fire regimes. Invertebrates are a key component of biological communities, but studies of fire impacts on diverse invertebrate assemblages over long timeframes are rare. The responses of ground- and foliage-active invertebrate assemblages to fire in buttongrass moorlands were investigated using a space-for-time design. Assemblages in recently burnt moorlands were distinct from those in older moorlands. Contrary to expectations, ground-active invertebrate abundance, but not taxon richness, was greatest in young regrowth (2-3 years since last fire), owing to large populations of Formicidae, Orthoptera, Collembola and Diptera. Foliage-active invertebrate assemblages followed the expected trend with least numbers of invertebrates and taxa in young regrowth. Very few taxa (n=9) were absent from young successional stages and none were absent from later successional stages. Invertebrate assemblages in moorlands on low productivity soils took approximately twice as long to return to their pre-fire state than assemblages on moderate productivity soils. The shifts in invertebrate composition were associated with shifts in vegetation composition. Vegetation density was found to be a potentially important predictor of invertebrate compositional variation. Fire in buttongrass moorland appears to have a limited impact on ground-active and foliage-active invertebrate assemblages, suggesting that these components of the invertebrate fauna are resilient to fire (i.e. able to return to the pre-fire state). Given that fire impedes successional processes that convert moorlands into rainforest, and eliminate many of the moorland invertebrate species, conservation management of moorlands should involve the acceptance or imposition of fire.

T1  - Soil Erosion Risk Assessment in Uganda
AN  - 1878398849
AB  - Land use without adequate soil erosion control measures is continuously increasing the  risk of soil erosion by water mainly in developing tropical countries. These countries are prone to  environmental disturbance due to high population growth and high rainfall intensity. The aim of  this study is to assess the state of soil erosion by water in Uganda at national and district levels, for  various land cover and land use (LCLU) types, in protected areas as well to predict the impact of  support practices on soil loss reduction. Predictions obtained using the Revised Universal Soil Loss  Equation (RUSLE) model indicated that the mean rate of soil loss risk in Uganda's erosion-prone  lands was 3.2 t*ha-1*y-1, resulting in a total annual soil loss of about 62 million tons in 2014. About  39% of the country's erosion-prone lands were comprised of unsustainable mean soil loss rates >1  t*ha-1*y-1. Out of 112 districts in Uganda, 66 districts were found to have unsustainable estimated  soil loss rates >1 t*ha-1*y-1. Six districts in Uganda were found to have mean annual soil loss rates of  >10 t*ha-1*y-1: Bududa (46.3 t*ha-1*y-1), Kasese (37.5 t*ha-1*y-1), Bundibugyo (28.9 t*ha-1*y-1), Bulambuli  (20.9 t*ha-1*y-1), Sironko (14.6 t*ha-1*y-1) and Kotido (12.5 t*ha-1*y-1). Among the LCLU types, the  highest soil loss rates of 11 t*ha-1*y-1 and 10.6 t*ha-1*y-1 were found in moderate natural forest and  dense natural forest, respectively, mainly due to their locations in highland areas characterized by  steep slopes ranging between 16% to 21% and their high rainfall intensity, ranging from 1255  mm*y-1 to 1292 mm*y-1. Only five protected areas in Uganda were found to have high mean  estimated mean soil loss rates >10 t*ha-1*y-1: Rwenzori Mountains (142.94 t*ha-1*y-1), Mount Elgon  (33.81 t*ha-1*y-1), Bokora corridor (12.13 t*ha-1*y-1), Matheniko (10.39 t*ha-1*y-1), and Nangolibwel  (10.33 t*ha-1*y-1). To manage soil erosion in Uganda's protected areas, there is an urgent need to  control wildfires and human-induced disturbances such as timber harvesting and soil compaction  from  domestic  animals.  Our  study  analysis  revealed  that  well-established  terraces  and  strip-cropping could significantly reduce soil loss rates in Uganda's croplands by 80% (from 1.5  t*ha-1*y-1 to 0.3 t*ha-1*y-1) and by 47% (from 1.5 t*ha-1*y-1 to 0.8 t*ha-1*y-1), respectively, well below the  sustainable soil erosion tolerance rate (1 t*ha-1*y-1) for land and water conservation.

T1  - Torpor and basking after a severe wildfire: mammalian survival strategies in a scorched landscape
AN  - 1865252763
AB  - Wildfires can completely obliterate above-ground vegetation, yet some small terrestrial mammals survive during and after fires. As knowledge about the physiological and behavioural adaptations that are crucial for post-wildfire survival is scant, we investigated the thermal biology of a small insectivorous marsupial (Antechinus flavipes) after a severe forest fire. Some populations of antechinus survived the fire in situ probably by hiding deep in rocky crevices, the only fire-proof sites near where they were trapped. We hypothesised that survival in the post-fire landscape was achieved by decreasing daytime activity and using torpor frequently to save energy. Indeed, daytime activity was less common and torpor expression was substantially higher ([greater than or equal to]2-fold) at the post-fire site than observed in an unburnt control site and also in comparison to a laboratory study, both when food was provided ad libitum and withheld. Basking in the post-fire site was also recorded, which was likely used to further reduce energy expenditure. Our data suggest that torpor and basking are used by this terrestrial mammal to reduce energy and foraging requirements, which is important in a landscape where food and shelter are limited and predation pressure typically is increased.

T1  - Using operating area size and adjacency constraints to mitigate the effects of harvesting activities on boreal caribou habitat
AN  - 1865250344
AB  - Context

              
Sustained timber harvesting conflicts with the long-term viability of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. The spatial arrangement of harvest blocks in the landscape could mitigate the impact of logging on caribou populations. For the forest industry, however, these measures represent constraints that reduce the annual allowable cut (AAC).

              
Objective

              
Estimate the long-term impacts of spatial constraints to harvesting, applied alone or in combination, on AAC and boreal caribou populations.

              
Methods

              
We divided a 30,000 km2 region into 20 harvest block sizes varying from 50 to 1000 km2, and modeled the implementation of spatially explicit harvest schedule plans in combination with wildfire and caribou population dynamics. We then evaluated the probability of persistence of boreal caribou populations.

              
Results

              
The probability of maintaining an AAC target declined with increasing target AAC, increasing size of operating area, and increasing adjacency constraints. In contrast, the probability of maintaining caribou populations declined with increasing AAC, decreasing size of operating areas, and decreasing adjacency constraints. An increase in operating area size from 50 to 300 km2 produced a considerable gain in AAC for all adjacency constraints.

              
Conclusions

              
Because adjacency constraints led only to a small increase in the probability of maintaining caribou populations, we recommend adopting less constraining landscape management actions, such as a 70-year period between two consecutive harvests in the same ~300-km2 operating area.

T1  - Effects of fire on pollinators and pollination
AN  - 1859423718
AB  - Summary

              
Increased incidence of landscape fire and pollinator declines with co-extinctions of dependent plant species are both globally significant. Fire can alter species distributions, but its effects on plant-pollinator interactions are poorly understood so its present and future role in coupled plant-pollinator declines cannot be assessed.

              
We develop a conceptual model of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. We review the empirical literature in the context of this model to identify important knowledge gaps regarding the processes underlying these effects and the phenotypic traits of flowering plants and pollinators mediating these effects. Fire generates, and plant-pollinator interactions respond to, heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. There is evidence of local-scale fire effects on these interactions, but landscape-scale effects are poorly understood. Nest location and floral resource utilization primarily mediate pollinator survival during and after fire. Voltinism and mobility traits are potentially important, but poorly studied. Plant traits mediating flowering responses to fire include growth form, phenology and potentially bud location, seasonal changes in bud exposure and response to bud damage.

              
Synthesis and applications. We suggest management actions and an agenda for future research to fill knowledge gaps currently inhibiting predictions of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. Fire regimes promoting floral diversity at local scales provide a surrogate means of managing pollinators and pollination while empirical research continues. Above-ground nesting, univoltine pollinators may be particularly vulnerable under expected fire regime changes. Improved knowledge of traits mediating the exploitation of landscape heterogeneity could be used to enhance the persistence of these species. Ultimately, our conceptual framework could be used as a basis for understanding fire effects on aggregate network properties to inform fire management strategies buffering plant-pollinator networks against secondary species extinctions.

T1  - Temporal variability in large grazer space use in an experimental landscape
AN  - 2288133851
AB  - Land use, climate change, and their interaction each have great potential to affect grazing systems. With anticipated more frequent and extensive future drought, a more complete understanding of the mechanisms that determine large grazer landscape‐level distribution under varying climatic conditions is integral to ecosystem management. Using an experimental setting with contrasting fire treatments, we describe the inter‐annual variability of the effect of landscape topography and disturbance from prescribed spring fire on large grazer space use in years of variable resource availability. Using GPS telemetry, we investigated space use of plains bison (Bison bison bison) as they moved among watersheds managed with variable experimental burn treatments (1‐, 2‐, 4‐, and 20‐year burn intervals) during a seven‐year period spanning years of average‐to‐above average forage production and severe drought. At the landscape scale, bison more strongly favored high‐elevation and recently burned watersheds with watersheds burned for the first time in 2 or 4 yr consistently showing higher use relative to annually burned watersheds. In particular, watersheds burned for the first time in 4 yr were avoided to lesser extent than other more frequently burned watersheds during the dormant season. This management type also maintained coupling between bison space use and post‐fire regrowth across post‐drought growing season months, whereas watersheds with more frequent fire‐return intervals attracted bison in only the first month post‐fire. Hence, fire frequency played a role in maintaining the coupling of grazer and post‐fire regrowth, the fire–grazer interaction, in response to drought‐induced reduction in fuel loads. Moreover, bison avoided upland habitat in poor forage production years, when forage regrowth is less likely to occur in upland than in lowland habitats. Such quantified responses of bison to landscape features can aid future conservation management efforts and planning to sustain fire–grazer interactions and resulting spatial heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems.

T1  - Terrestrial Condition Assessment for National Forests of the USDA Forest Service in the Continental US
AN  - 1977788043
AB  - The terrestrial condition assessment (TCA) evaluates effects of uncharacteristic stressors and disturbance agents on land-type associations (LTAs) to identify restoration opportunities on national forest system (NFS) lands in the United States. A team of agency scientists and managers, representing a broad array of natural resource disciplines, developed a logic structure for the TCA to identify appropriate data sources to support analyses. Primary national data sources included observed insect- and pathogen-induced mortality, key critical loads for soil and the atmosphere, long term seasonal departures in temperature and precipitation, road densities, uncharacteristic wildfires, historical fire regime departure, wildfire potential, insect and pathogen risk, and vegetation departure from natural range of variability. The TCA was implemented with the ecosystem management decision support (EMDS) system, a spatial decision support system for landscape analysis and planning. EMDS uses logic models to interpret data, synthesizes information over successive layers of logic topics, and draws inferences about the ecological integrity of LTAs as an initial step to identifying high priority LTAs for landscape restoration on NFS lands. Results from the analysis showed that about 74 percent of NFS lands had moderate or better overall ecological integrity. Major impacts to ecological integrity included risk of mortality due to insects and disease, extent of current mortality, extent of areas with high and very high wildfire hazard potential, uncharacteristically severe wildfire, and elevated temperatures. In the discussion, we consider implications for agency performance reporting on restoration activities, and subsequent possible steps, including strategic and tactical planning for restoration. The objective of the paper is to describe the TCA framework with results from a national scale application on NFS lands.

T1  - Spatial refuges buffer landscapes against homogenisation and degradation by large herbivore populations and facilitate vegetation heterogeneity
AN  - 1909555295
AB  - Environmental heterogeneity across savanna landscapes, including different seasonal resources at different distances to water, may play a critical role in maintaining the size and diversity of wildlife populations and the sustainability of their resource base. We investigated whether extensive landscapes with functionally diverse seasonal resources and large waterless regions can mediate the effect of herbivory on plant composition, structure and diversity. Vegetation composition, structure and richness in two different vegetation types (mopane and sandveld woodland) at three distance zones (0 km - 5 km, 10 km - 15 km and > 20 km) from the permanent water of the Okavango Delta and Linyanti Swamps were surveyed. We modelled vegetation response of the most abundant species to herbivory in relation to distance from permanent water, and included fire frequency as a covariate. Trees favoured by elephants during the dry season occurred typically as immature, pollarded populations within 5 km of permanent water sources while mature tall populations of these species were found far from water (> 10 km - 15 km). Similarly, short high-quality grazing grasses were higher in abundance within 5 km of permanent water, whereas taller high-quality perennial grasses peaked in abundance beyond 20 km from permanent water. Trends in herbaceous richness with distance from water were contingent upon vegetation type, while tree richness did not change with distance from water. Spatial refuges in waterless regions of landscapes facilitate the creation of heterogeneity of vegetation structure, composition and richness by large herds of mammalian herbivores. Therefore, the extension of herbivore dry season foraging range, for example, by the creation of artificial water points (AWP) in backcountry woodlands, could seriously undermine the resilience of landscapes to herbivory by reducing the availability of spatial refuges. Consequently, it reduces the resilience of herbivore and predator populations that depend on these spatial refuges. We strongly advise that future scientific work, and management and policy actions should be focused on the identification and sustaining of these spatial refuges in wildlife areas. Conservation implications: Management and policy actions should be focused on the identification and sustainability of spatial refuges in wildlife areas. Too many AWP in backcountry woodlands could undermine the resilience of landscapes to herbivory by reducing the proportion of landscapes beyond 15 km from permanent water.

T1  - Special Issue: Targeted Woodland Removal to Recover At-Risk Grouse and Their Sagebrush-Steppe and Prairie Ecosystems
AN  - 1861146227
AB  - Threats vary in intensity across the region, but the most extensive top-down stressors impacting these shrub and grassland ecosystems include conversion of native rangelands to row crop agriculture, residential subdivision, energy, mining and other industrial developments, woodland expansion, type conversion from native vegetation to invasive species, and altered wildfire regimes (US Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] 2013).  Newly signed land use plans are designed to guide future human infrastructure outside of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter "sage-grouse") and Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; "prairie-chicken") strongholds, and voluntary and incentive-based conservation actions help improve habitat quality (i.e., habitat restoration) and reduce habitat loss (e.g., easements) to human development and row crop agriculture (Copeland et al., 2014; Van Pelt et al., 2015).

T1  - Extending Conifer Removal and Landscape Protection Strategies from Sage-grouse to Songbirds, a Range-Wide Assessment
AN  - 1861146194
AB  - Recent and unprecedented scale of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) conservation in the American West enables assessment of community-level benefits afforded to other sagebrush-obligate species. We use North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) count data and machine-learning to assess predictors influencing spatial distribution and abundance of three sagebrush-obligate songbirds (Brewer's sparrow [Spizella breweri], sagebrush sparrow [Artemisiospiza nevadensis], and sage thrasher [Oreoscoptes montanus]). We quantified co-occurrence of songbird abundance with sage-grouse lek distributions using point pattern analyses and evaluated the concurrence of songbird abundance within sage-grouse habitat restoration and landscape protection. Sagebrush land-cover predictors were positively associated with the abundance of each songbird species in models that explained 16-37% of variation in BBS route level counts. Individual songbird models identified an apparent 40% threshold in sagebrush land-cover, over which songbird abundances nearly doubled. Songbird abundances were positively associated with sage-grouse distributions (P< 0.01); range-wide, landscapes supporting > 50% of males on leks also harbored 13-19% higher densities of songbirds compared with range-wide mean densities. Eighty-five percent of the conifer removal conducted through the Sage Grouse Initiative coincided with high to moderate Brewer's sparrow abundance. Wyoming's landscape protection (i.e., "core area") strategy for sage-grouse encompasses half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations. In the Great Basin half the high to moderate abundance sagebrush sparrow and sage thrasher populations coincide with sage-grouse Fire and Invasive Assessment Tool priorities, where conservation actions are being focused in an attempt to reduce the threat of wildfire and invasive plants. Our work illustrates spatially targeted actions being implemented ostensibly for sage-grouse largely overlap high abundance centers for three sagebrush obligate passerines and are likely providing significant conservation benefits for less well-known sagebrush songbirds and other sagebrush-associated wildlife.

T1  - Mapping Tree Canopy Cover in Support of Proactive Prairie Grouse Conservation in Western North America
AN  - 1861146167
AB  - Invasive woody plant expansion is a primary threat driving fragmentation and loss of sagebrush (Artemisiaspp.) and prairie habitats across the central and western United States. Expansion of native woody plants, including conifer (primarilyJuniperusspp.) and mesquite (Prosopisspp.), over the past century is primarily attributable to wildfire suppression, historic periods of intensive livestock grazing, and changes in climate. To guide successful conservation programs aimed at reducing top-down stressors, we mapped invasive woody plants at regional scales to evaluate landscape level impacts, target restoration actions, and monitor restoration outcomes. Our overarching goal was to produce seamless regional products across sociopolitical boundaries with resolution fine enough to depict the spatial extent and degree of woody plant invasion relevant to greater sage-grouse(Centrocercus urophasianus)and lesser prairie-chicken(Tympanuchus pallidicinctus)conservation efforts. We mapped tree canopy cover at 1-m spatial resolution across an 11-state region (508 265 km2). Greater than 90% of occupied lesser prairie-chicken habitat was largely treeless for conifers (<1% canopy cover), whereas > 67% was treeless for mesquite. Conifers in the higher canopy cover classes (16-50% and >50% canopy cover) were scarce (<2% and 1% canopy cover), as was mesquite (<5% and 1% canopy cover). Occupied habitat by sage-grouse was more variable but also had a relatively large proportion of treeless areas (x-= 71, SE = 5%). Low to moderate levels of conifer cover (1-20%) were fewer (x-= 23, SE = 5%) as were areas in the highest cover class (>50%;x-= 6, SE = 2%). Mapping indicated that a high proportion of invading woody plants are at a low to intermediate level. Canopy cover maps for conifer and mesquite resulting from this study provide the first and most geographically complete, high-resolution assessment of woody plant cover as a top-down threat to western sage-steppe and prairie ecosystems.

T1  - Challenges and limitations to native species restoration in the Great Basin, USA
AN  - 1858234098
AB  - The Great Basin of the western USA is an arid region characterized by high spatial and temporal variability. The region experienced high levels of ecological disturbance during the early period of Euro-American settlement, especially from about 1870-1935. The principal plant communities of the Great Basin are sagebrush steppes, dominated by various Artemisia shrubs and perennial bunchgrasses that represent the largest rangeland ecosystem in North America. In low to mid-elevation sagebrush communities, exotic annual grasses have displaced native plant species and are associated with a dramatic increase in size and frequency of wildfires. Degradation in this region is driven by processes that cause the loss of mature bunchgrasses, which, when intact, limit exotic annual grass invasion. Historically, large economic investments to restore degraded Great Basin rangeland through establishment of native bunchgrasses, principally utilizing heavily mechanized agronomic approaches, have been met with limited success. A multitude of environmental factors contribute to the lack of restoration success in this region, but seedling mortality from freezing and drought has been identified as a primary demographic limitation to successful bunchgrass establishment. Novel approaches to overcoming limitations to bunchgrass establishment will be required for restoration success. Increased national concern and a near listing of the greater sage-grouse, a steppe-obligate species, to Endangered Species status, has spurred greater regional support and collaboration across a diversity of stakeholder groups such as state and federal land and wildlife management agencies, county planners, and ranchers.

T1  - Ecosystem resilience is evident 17&#xa0;years after fire in Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems
AN  - 2313385968
AB  - Recent policy has focused on prevention of wildfire in the sagebrush steppe in an effort to protect habitat for the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). Historically, fire return intervals in Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis) ecosystems were 50–100 yr or more, but invasive species, climate change, and a legacy of intensive grazing practices have led to degraded rangeland condition, altered fire regimes and fire effects, and declines in sagebrush cover. Little is known about the long‐term impacts of fire in this ecosystem in areas where grazing pressure has been removed, few invasive species exist, and fire return intervals are maintained. In this study, we quantified vegetation composition prior to prescribed burning, 1 year following fire, and 17 years after fire in a native‐dominated Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystem at Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Oregon, United States. Seventeen years following fire, the ecosystem was dominated by native herbaceous vegetation, with 8.3% cover of broad‐leaved forbs and bunchgrasses in the understory, compared to just 3.8% cover of native herbaceous vegetation in unburned controls. Invasive annual grass cover ranged from 0.2% to 8.4% across all treatments and years (P = 0.56). One year following fire, the distance from a randomly located point and the nearest mature sagebrush was 16.6 m, but by 17 years after the fire, that distance had decreased to 2.5 m. Seventeen years after fires, shrub cover was 0.4–4% in burned plots compared to 13–24% in unburned controls. Collectively, these data demonstrate that good condition ungrazed Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities exhibited resilience following fire and maintained a native‐dominated mosaic of shrubs, bunchgrasses, and forbs. Further, unburned control plots were dominated by woody vegetation and exhibited losses in herbaceous understory, possibly indicating that they are outside of their natural fire return interval. Our results illustrate that management of all habitat components, including natural disturbance and a mosaic of successional stages, is important for persistent resilience and that suppression of all fires in the sagebrush steppe may create long‐term losses of heterogeneity in good condition Wyoming big sagebrush ecosystems.

T1  - Exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of habitat suitability to improve conservation management of a vulnerable plant species
AN  - 1865495067
AB  - Ongoing declines in biodiversity caused by global environmental changes call for adaptive conservation management, including the assessment of habitat suitability spatiotemporal dynamics potentially affecting species persistence. Remote sensing (RS) provides a wide-range of satellite-based environmental variables that can be fed into species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate species-environment relations and forecast responses to change. We address the spatiotemporal dynamics of species' habitat suitability at the landscape level by combining multi-temporal RS data with SDMs for analysing inter-annual habitat suitability dynamics. We implemented this framework with a vulnerable plant species (Veronica micrantha), by combining SDMs with a time-series of RS-based metrics of vegetation functioning related to primary productivity, seasonality, phenology and actual evapotranspiration. Besides RS variables, predictors related to landscape structure, soils and wildfires were ranked and combined through multi-model inference (MMI). To assess recent dynamics, a habitat suitability time-series was generated through model hindcasting. MMI highlighted the strong predictive ability of RS variables related to primary productivity and water availability for explaining the test-species distribution, along with soil, wildfire regime and landscape composition. The habitat suitability time-series revealed the effects of short-term land cover changes and inter-annual variability in climatic conditions. Multi-temporal SDMs further improved predictions, benefiting from RS time-series. Overall, results emphasize the integration of landscape attributes related to function, composition and spatial configuration for improving the explanation of ecological patterns. Moreover, coupling SDMs with RS functional metrics may provide early-warnings of future environmental changes potentially impacting habitat suitability. Applications discussed include the improvement of biodiversity monitoring and conservation strategies.

T1  - Forest ecosystems of temperate climatic regions: from ancient use to climate change
AN  - 1848480769
AB  - 871

              
I.

              
I. Introduction

              
Forest ecosystems have always been an integral part of human existence, whether as a source of food, fiber, and habitat, as an essential component in maintaining the atmospheric balance of O2 and CO2, or as a source of musical, artistic, or poetic inspiration.Gilliam 

              
I chose to begin my book on the ecology of herbaceous communities of forests of eastern North America with this statement for both personal and professional reasons. I suspect that many, if not most, people who have had direct contact with forests eventually grow to establish an intimate connection with them, and at a variety of levels. It was such a personal intimacy that led to my scientific study of them. As this is a Tansley review, it is an appropriate aside to note that Sir Arthur Tansley himself conveyed a special sense of awe regarding forests, more specifically the Kingley Vale in his native England (Fig. ), which offered a view that Tansley considered 'the finest in England,' a place that held both spiritual and professional significance for him, first as an 11-yr-old boy and later as an international leader in the field of plant ecology (Ayres, ).

              
Although humans have long utilized resources associated with all forest biomes - tropical, subtropical, temperate and boreal - I suggest that it is the expanse of human populations in the temperate region that has left the most indelible anthropogenic signature among forested regions. Certainly, deforestation in the tropics has been, and continues to be, a serious environmental concern, for example, with projected loss of forest cover being up to 40% for the Amazon Basin by 2050 (Soares-Fihlo et al., ), and a global annual loss rate of 0.4% (Hansen et al., ; Malhi et al., ). However, a far greater relative fraction of the original extent of temperate forests of the eastern United States has at one time been harvested, with estimates of < 1% of these original forests remaining as primary (old-growth) forests (Davis, ). Older examples of anthropogenic alteration are wide-spread in Central Europe, where forest conversion dates back to the Neolithic Period (EEA, ). Dambrine et al.  found evidence for 2000-yr-old ecological legacies created by temperate forest conversion and subsequent agricultural practices by the Romans in central France. Older still is the human imprint left on temperate forests of China, wherein extensive forest alteration dates back some 6000 yr before present (BP), to such an extent that the roles of climate and anthropogenic disturbance are essentially confounded in understanding long-term patterns of change in vegetation (Liu, ). Thus, if there is a common theme across the global distribution of temperate forests, it is that the human imprint on them is indelibly large and deep, and more so than with any other forest biome type.

              
The term 'global change' is a collective term to describe anthropogenic modification of all aspects of the global environment that has the potential to alter the sustainability of the Earth for life. Often erroneously used interchangeably with anthropogenic climate change (hereafter, simply 'climate change'), global change comprises not only climate change, but also other essential facets of environmental change that interact with climate change, including land use, modification of local and regional hydrological cycles, changes in biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity loss (Vitousek, ; Steffen et al., ; Franklin et al., ). Clearly, global change is not only quite evident in all temperate forests of the world, but also it has long been so.

              
Indeed, there is an ancient legacy of human alteration of landscapes of temperate forests on a global scale. In North America, notable evidence suggests that, far before the arrival of Europeans, use of fire by Native American peoples greatly impacted the composition of eastern hardwood forests, especially regarding tree species of masting or fruiting value, either directly for food or indirectly for game forage (Kay & Simmons, ). Even the English landscape that was so dear to Tansley (e.g. the Kingley Vale panorama; Fig. ) was anything but pristine wilderness, given widespread deforestation of the English landscape by Romans 2000 yr BP (Williams, ). These observations challenge the very notion of what truly constitutes a primary or pristine state. Further, global change should never be considered a solely recent, modern phenomenon.

              
New terminology has recently been developed to address this awareness. Ellis et al.  quantified anthropogenic change of global biomes (anthromes). Even our current epoch - the Holocene - is increasingly being referred to as the Anthropocene considering wide temporal and spatial scales of human alteration of all facets of the biosphere, from domestication of animal species and conversion of vast areas of land for cultivation, to long-term changes in atmospheric chemistry (Steffen et al., ; Ellis, ; Lewis & Maslin, ).

              
Ellis  conceptualized how humans, more than any other multicellular organism, have transformed Earth's ecosystems, including temperate forests, leading to what he calls anthroecology theory. Figure  provides a visual representation of this theory for a temperate woodland. Beginning with earliest human inhabitation of the Earth, human populations have not only expanded in number, but have also changed socio-culturally, from hunter-gatherer, to horticultural, eventually to our current industrial status. The result has been chronic anthropogenic change in land use and cover, patterns of energy consumption, ecosystem properties (e.g. carbon flux and nutrient cycling) and ecosystem state (from 'wild' to 'novel' to 'used') (Fig. ). This provides a conceptual framework for this review, as it links ancient use of temperate forests to current patterns of climate change.

              
The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, with particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of temperate forests. Although these are generally found between 20° and 60° in each of the north and south latitudes, because land mass distribution of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical (more land occurring north of the equator) and due to a variety of climatic, oceanographic, and orographic factors, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the widespread nature of their northern counterparts. Consequently, somewhat more emphasis will be placed on temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere.

II. A brief biogeography and history of temperate forests

              
In North America, temperate forests span most of the eastern United States as hardwoods of widely varying species dominance, with conifer and mixed (conifer/hardwood) forests occurring in parts of the southeast, west and, especially, the Pacific Northwest, from the coastal United States into Canada. Temperate forests dominate essentially all of England and northern Europe, with a narrow band reaching far into Russia, much of eastern China and virtually all of Japan (Fig. ). Distributions of temperate forests are more restricted in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere, including southern Chile, southeastern Australia and all of Tasmania, and parts of New Zealand, including all of the North Island, where it is referred to as oceanic temperate forest (McGlone et al., ). Temperate conifers tend to dominate in more extreme conditions (e.g. cold climates and/or infertile soils) (Reich & Frelich, ; Waring, ), or in fire-dominated regions (e.g. the southeastern Coastal Plain and western regions of the USA), although conifer dominance in other regions (e.g. North American Pacific Northwest) has been ascribed to unusually long photosynthetic seasons arising from mild winters with abundant rainfall (Givnish, ) (Fig. ).

              
The predominant climate of most of these forest regions is one of distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. Specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display impressive variability among temperate forest regions, a function of latitude (longer growing seasons toward at lower latitudes), topographic features (e.g. mountains) and proximity to oceans with marine currents of varying prevailing temperatures. The latter is evidenced by the development of temperate rainforests associated with coastal main lands or islands, including the Pacific coast of North America and small areas of Great Britain and Japan, and throughout most of southern Chile, southeastern Australia and southern New Zealand (Alaback, ).

              
Geological history and soil formation also vary greatly among temperate forests, thus precluding broad generalizations (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ). In North America the geological (continental) structure is generally symmetrical, beginning with the middle outward including shield, interior lowlands, mountains, coastal plains, continental shelves and ocean basins. By contrast, Eurasia lacks such symmetry, with Europe being geologically separated from Asia by the Ural Mountains (King, ). Thus, the broad spatial patterns of soil formation in North America contrast sharply with those for Asia (Bally & Palmer, ; Ponge et al., ; King, ).

              
One aspect of geological history shared among temperate forests is the profound effects of glaciation (Clark et al., ). Most relevant is the occurrence of the last glacial maximum (LGM), a period of widespread surface ice that ended c. 20 000 yr bp (Yokoyama et al., ). Given the extent of LGM glaciers (Fig. a,b), any exposition of temperate forests necessitates at least a perfunctory understanding of their widespread nature. Glaciations of the LGM even have a diverse nomenclature, based on global location (Ehlers & Gibbard, ). Prominent in the Northern Hemisphere were the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and the Devensian,Wurm and Weichselian glaciations in the British Isles, Alps and Northern/Central Europe, respectively. In the Southern Hemisphere, LGM glaciers include the Llanquihue and Otira glaciations in Chile and New Zealand, respectively.

              
Despite their widespread occurrence, temperate forests of many regions are similar in development toward their present state. Most of the Northern Hemisphere was once dominated by the Arcto-Tertiary geoflora (Cain, ; Axelrod, ; Whittaker, ). This was a time (c. 15 Myr BP) of a far warmer global climate than the present one, which was especially pronounced toward polar areas. Within this expansive forest were numerous gymnosperm genera, such as Cedrus,Picea,Pinus and Tsuga, and angiosperm genera - Acer,Betula,Carya,Corylus,Castanea,Fagus,Magnolia,Quercus,Tilia,Ulmus and Liquidambar (Xiang et al., ; Graham, ). Increased warming during the Tertiary yielded to the cooler Quaternary, leading to the massive glaciers of the LGM over much of what is now boreal forest throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. a). This pushed many species south toward the unglaciated refugia (e.g. Appalachian Mountains), which may have provided sources of remigration of species toward their current distributions (Davis, ; Graham, ; Stebich et al., ).

              
Interestingly, the LGM is essentially irrelevant for temperate forests of China, largely unaffected by Quaternary glaciation (Liu, ). Pollen records reveal a diverse assemblage of tree genera at this time, varying from mixed conifer-hardwood to deciduous to widespread subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests; hardwoods comprised genera similar to other temperate forests of the Northern Hemisphere, with a diverse oak (Quercus) flora (Liu, ). Stratigraphy of mid-Holocene pollen demonstrates a period of maximum warmth (i.e. the Hypsithermal). Throughout northern regions at this time, forests increased in diversity with thermophilous hardwoods expanding, replacing both pine and, toward the south, birch (Liu, ).

              
Although glaciation also occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, other processes were equally significant in determining its temperate forest tree flora, including higher sea-to-land ratios creating conditions leading to temperate rain forests on west-facing coasts (Alaback, ) and species of Nothofagus and conifers of the families Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). During the Tertiary Period, drying occurred in continental regions, selecting more xeromorphic and even pyrophilic, fire-tolerant genera, such as Eucalyptus (Beard, ).

              
Fire - typically more prevalent among conifer-dominated stands than hardwood-dominated stands - has long been an integral factor in directing the development of temperate forest ecosystems. Marlon et al.  used the paleorecord to examine the relationship between abrupt changes in global climate and enhanced frequency of fire. Using data from 35 charcoal/pollen records in North America to assess change in fire regimes during the past 15-10 kyr (the latest glacial-interglacial transition, and a time of profound climate change), they found clear links between fire frequency and degree of climate change. Implicit in their evidence is the intimate connection between occurrence of fire and the development of drought conditions in forested regions.

III. Climate, soils, composition and land use

              
1. North America

              
Temperate forests of North America occur in the eastern United States primarily as hardwood forests (except for extreme high elevations and southeastern Coastal Plain pinelands) and as conifer and mixed forests in parts of the western United States and Canada. Using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification (Kottek et al., ), the predominant eastern climate would be classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) to the south, and humid continental (Dfa) to the north; prevailing climates for western forests are predominantly warm temperate (Csb), with boreal zone-like conditions (Dfc) at high elevations of central western USA. Winter climate is dominated by fluctuations between cold, dry arctic air, along with cyclonic storms with marine-derived moisture to produce occasional heavy snows. Winter temperatures vary from means of -5°C in the north to 10°C toward the south. Spring brings thunderstorm activity through mixing of cold polar air with moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. Mean summer temperatures throughout the region range from 20° to 27°C. Frost-free periods are generally between 120 and 150 d in the north to > 250 d in the south. Mean annual precipitation is 80-140 cm (Archibold, ). The prevailing climate of the Pacific Northwest forests is largely maritime, varying with latitude and elevation, with precipitation increasing with elevation (Franklin & Halpern, ).

              
Soils of eastern forests are generally Alfisols, Inceptisols and Ultisols, glaciated towards the north (Fig. a). Unglaciated soils are old, with soil pH decreasing with age. Soils of western forests are spatially variable. Montane conifer forest soils are usually young, derived from granites, gneisses and schists (Peet, ). Pacific Northwest conifer forest soils comprise Ultisols, Inceptisols and Spodosols, with many soils of volcanic origin (Franklin & Halpern, ).

              
With the exception of the virtual elimination of the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) by the chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) beginning in 1904, current eastern temperate forest types are largely similar to those originally described by Braun . With the highest tree diversity occurring in the mixed mesophytic forest region of the Appalachians, dominant genera include oaks (Quercus spp.), maples (Acer spp.), hickories (Carya spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), along with American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera).

              
Conifer forests vary greatly within the broad temperate region of North America. At the higher elevations throughout the Appalachian mountain range (800-1200 m above sea level (asl) in New England to 1600 m asl in the Great Smoky Mountains), spruce (Abies spp.) and fir (Picea spp.) forests are common (Vankat, ). Southeastern Coastal Plain conifer forests are predominantly pines (Pinus spp.) of a primarily successional nature, the result of frequent natural (e.g. fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. harvesting) disturbances (Platt et al., ); these typically change through secondary succession to Quercus-Carya forests (Peet et al., ). Before European settlement c. 250 yr bp, this region was dominated by a single species - Pinus palustris - which is currently < 3% of its original distribution (Gilliam & Platt, ).

              
Montane conifer forests of western North America contain more genera than those of the eastern United States. Important genera include fir (Abies spp.), juniper (Juniperus spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), pine (Pinus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Some of these form mixed forests, especially those associated with elevation gradients and successional status following disturbances, such as fire; hardwoods include maple (Acer spp.), alder (Alnus spp.), poplar (Populus spp.) and mountain ash (Sorbus spp.) (Peet, ). The mild, moist climate of Pacific Northwest (coastal forests west of the Cascade crest) selects for a complex assortment of conifer species, including Pseudotsuga menziesii,Tsuga spp., Abies spp., Pinus spp. and several genera of cedars (family Cupressaceae, e.g. Calocedrus,Chamaecyparis,Thuja), including the awe-inspiring redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest tree in the world (Franklin & Halpern, ).

              
2. Europe

              
The European Environment Agency divides Europe into 11 biogeographical regions, based on prevailing climate and proximity to bodies of water (EEA, ). Regions most germane to this discussion are the Atlantic, Black Sea, Continental and Pannonian, with Continental occupying by far the largest area (Finnie et al., ). Temperate forests here are predominantly hardwood species, with conifer forests increasing in importance toward the north and with increasing elevation. These extend farther east into western Russia, wherein climate becomes increasingly continental and drier, contrasting with the maritime climate toward the west. The climate throughout this area ranges from temperate oceanic (Do) in the west to temperate continental (Dc) eastward (Kottek et al., ). Winter temperatures vary from maritime means of 3° to 5°C to continental means of -4° to -15°C in central Russia. Mean summer temperatures generally range from 22° to 30°C. Mean annual precipitation is 50-75 cm, with snow uncommon in lowland parts of Europe (Archibold, ).

              
Many of the soils of Europe often are referred to collectively as brown earths, which are similar to North American Alfisols, except that many are developed from calcareous parent materials wherein they are more similar to Inceptisols. Other common soils are Spodosols, especially in northern latitudes (Jones et al., ).

              
Human alteration of temperate forests over recent millennia is perhaps most pronounced here (Mitchell & Cole, ; Niklasson et al., ), where only c. 25% of forests are considered primary (sensu FAO, : 'forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes have not been significantly disturbed'), something that disconnects forest distribution with climate (Allen et al., ). Evidence suggests that anthropogenic disturbance began there in the Neolithic, with widespread forest conversion beginning c. 7000 yr BP (EEA, ). Since these ancient times, forest condition has been closely linked with human populations and socio-economic development. Both historical and paleo-ecological records indicate periods not only of increased logging, but also of land abandonment and forest regrowth, including the plague years of the 1300s (EEA, ).

              
There are generally fewer tree species in Europe than in North America, a contrast further exacerbated by extensive planting of conifer species throughout hardwood ranges (Augusto et al., ). Despite this, the two regions share many deciduous genera, including Quercus,Acer,Betula,Ulmus and Fagus (Pages & Michalet, ; Ellenberg, ). EEA  recognizes a mesophytic deciduous forest type, quite analogous to that which dominates the eastern United States. Analogous to chestnut blight in eastern USA, European species of Ulmus, especially white elm (U. laevis), have been decimated by the Dutch elm disease (Ophiostoma ulmi), which has also decimated elm species of North America (Peterken, ).

              
The current extent of European temperate conifer forests is greatly modified by past and current policies to plant vast areas of productive conifer species. Again, widespread native deciduous forests have been replaced by conifer plantations, modifying the general composition of the western European temperate forest. Although some of these were transplanted from within Europe (e.g. Norway spruce, Picea abies and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris), others were imported from North America (e.g. Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis and Douglas fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii) (Augusto et al., ). Not surprisingly, then, as with hardwood genera, predominant European conifer genera overlap greatly with those of North America, including Abies,Picea and Pinus (EEA, ).

              
3. Asia

              
Similar to their North American counterparts, temperate forests of Asia occur primarily as hardwood forests throughout the eastern part of the continent, extending to and including virtually the entire island of Japan, except for extremes of elevation and north latitude, where there are well-developed boreal conifer forests (Aiba, ), resulting from similar climates between the two regions, primarily humid subtropical and temperate continental, Cf and Dc, respectively (Kottek et al., ). The most profound difference in climate between these regions is the existence of a monsoon season widespread in parts of Asia, arising from drastic pressure changes over the continent, that is, Monsoon Asia (Nakashizuka & Iida, ). Consequently, precipitation in Monsoon Asia has a pronounced summer maximum, with up to 90% falling between May and September. The wettest areas are on the Korean peninsula. Mean winter temperatures range from c. 3°C to -15°C in southern coastal and northern interior regions, respectively. Spring is dominated by moist tropical maritime air, with July temperatures averaging from 22°C to 28°C (Archibold, ).

              
Soils of Asian temperate forests are analogous to those of North American temperate forests. These vary from Alfisols in upland regions to Ultisols toward the south and east, with Entisols forming from alluvium along rivers. Spodosols develop in conifer-dominated regions associated with higher elevation and more northern latitudes (Archibold, ).

              
Although the temperate deciduous forests of Asia are the most species-rich temperate forests in the world, many of them have been altered irreparably by land use, particularly in the lowland plains, which are virtually entirely cultivated (An et al., ). Many Asian tree taxa are quite common in North America (Ying, ; Nakashizuka & Iida, ; Fang et al., ), including Quercus,Ulmus,Tilia,Fraxinus,Acer and Lindera (Henbo et al., ; Takahashi, ), and close relatives such as Asian Castanopsis and Distylium (Miura et al., ). Species vary greatly with elevation (Sang & Bai, ), with upland areas supporting species of Betula,Populus,Acer and Tilia;Salix,Betula and Populus are common in riparian areas (An et al., ). Forest type varies greatly with latitude; from north to south, this grades from mixed conifer to deciduous to mixed deciduous, then to widely distributed subtropical broadleaved evergreen forests (Liu, ).

              
Asian conifers increase in importance with increasing elevation. Working in Chinese subalpine forests, Taylor et al.  reported extensive stands as mosaics of conifer (Abies,Larix,Sabina and Tsuga) and hardwood (Betula) patches. Other conifer genera include Picea and Pinus (Miyajima & Takahashi, ).

              
4. Southern Hemisphere

              
Because the distribution of land mass of the biosphere is decidedly asymmetrical, with far more land area being distributed north of the equator, temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere lack the expansiveness so characteristic of the Northern Hemisphere. These forests are confined to relatively narrow bands along western South America, southeastern Australia (including all of Tasmania) and northern New Zealand, including the northwestern half of South Island. Climatic, oceanographic and orographic factors further limit forest development in many areas of the Southern Hemisphere. These regions display very high ocean:land mass ratios; consequently, they are generally of maritime temperate climates (Cf). The Andes range exerts a profound influence on the prevailing climate of temperate-forest South America, with the windward side receiving a relatively constant flow of maritime air from the Pacific Ocean (Perakis & Hedin, ), and many are temperate rain forests (Beard, ). Mean annual temperatures are generally 6-10°C, with a range typically < 10°C. In coastal areas, July-to-January temperatures vary only by 4° or 5°C, with a similar pattern found for coastal southwestern New Zealand. Indeed, summers average c. 20°C, with winters ranging from 10-15°C. Precipitation for most of these sites is very high, exceeding 300 cm, reaching as much as 850 cm (Sturman & Tapper, ).

              
Many of the soils throughout the temperate Southern Hemisphere are highly weathered Spodosols, the result of high amounts of rainfall and its associated fluctuating water table. These soils are generally highly acidic and infertile (Veblen et al., ; Grubb et al., ).

              
Forest genera, and even plant families, of the temperate forests of the Southern Hemisphere are quite dissimilar to those of the Northern Hemisphere. Prominent genera are Nothofagus (Nothofagaceae) and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae), neither part of the native flora in the Northern Hemisphere. Conifer genera are in Araucariaceae (e.g. Araucaria) and Podocarpaceae (e.g. Podocarpus,Dacrydium) (Beard, ; Kershaw & Wagstaff, ). Forests of Chile and Argentina vary sensitively along the Andes-induced climatic gradient. Nothofagus species are dominant throughout these forests (Veblen et al., ; Armesto et al., ), but with Araucaria araucana replacing Nothofagus species under more stressful environmental conditions (Sanguinetti & Kitzberger, ). Mainland forests of Australia are dominated by Eucalyptus and Acacia species, especially in drier areas, whereas Nothofagus species, along with gymnosperms, are found in the cool, moist forests of Tasmania. Nothofagus is common in New Zealand, covering 84% and 40% of the South and North Islands, respectively (Beard, ). The current status of many forests of the Southern Hemisphere represents considerably altered states of the primary conditions, for example, the rainforests of Chile before the Conquest of Chile in the mid-16th Century by Spain (Smith-Ramírez, ).

IV.

              
IV. Climate change

              
Humans have, indeed, long utilized temperate forests for a variety of purposes (Fig. ). Currently, temperate forests are managed worldwide for timber production, driven by an ever-increasing demand and resulting from relatively rapid growth among overstory dominant species, but also from the versatility of temperate tree species for numerous uses (e.g. paper, construction materials, furniture). Management practices potentially affect these forests across all spatial scales, from the landscape (Rhemtulla et al., ), to the overstory (Beaudet et al., ), and, often most sensitive, the herb layer (Moola & Vasseur, ; von Oheimb & Härdtle, ; Gilliam, ; Hedwall & Brunet, ). Furthermore, management practices historically often have been carried out using methods that are unsustainable in terms of maintaining forest ecosystem structure and function, including plantation forestry, especially conversion from slower-growing hardwood forests to faster-growing conifer plantations (Seidl et al., ), and forest fragmentation (Smith-Ramírez, ). Naudts et al.  suggested that broadscale conversion of temperate European hardwoods to conifer plantations contributes measurably to what is perhaps the most profound modern human influence on these forests - climate change (Lindner et al., ; Parks & Bernier, ).

              
Thus, I suggest the following as the 'bookends' of anthropogenic impacts on temperate forests. The first is their historic - even ancient - and chronic use/conversion by ever-increasing human populations; the second is climate change. The spatial and temporal dimensions of these are superimposed (Fig. ). The legacy effects of the recent and distant past are currently on a trajectory of future dynamics operating under the overriding influence of climate change (Dale et al., ), and all that is associated with it, including altered phenology of organisms (Parmesan & Yohe, ) and extremes of weather-related phenomena (Min et al., ) (Fig. ). All responses of temperate forests to current land-use pressures must be viewed forever through the lens of climate change (Fig. ).

              
In this final section, I emphasize challenges for future sustainability of global temperate forests. This is not meant to represent an exhaustive list of all critical issues. Rather, I emphasize those for which sufficient work has been done to provide an understanding of the nature of the problem. These include the effects of atmospheric deposition of excess N, global change-mediated alterations in phenology of temperate forest species and increases in drought/fire.

              
1. Excess nitrogen

              
More pronounced in the Northern than the Southern Hemisphere, a major human perturbation of temperate forests worldwide has arisen from emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into the atmosphere leading to chronically elevated deposition of Nr and a cascade of environmental stresses for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and human health (Galloway et al., ). The N comprising 78% of the atmosphere - N2 - is considered nonreactive N because it enters into essentially no photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and no metabolic pathways in organisms, other than N fixation by a small group of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic prokaryotes. However, numerous forms of Nr exist, including NH3, NH4+, NO, NO2, NO3-, 2N2O5, HNO3 and several forms of peroxyacetyl nitrates (Horii et al., ), all capable of undergoing photochemical transformations in the atmosphere and entering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.

              
Although more research on the effects of excess N has focused on herb-dominated than on forested ecosystems (Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ), increasingly work is being devoted to understanding such effects on forest ecosystems, including those of the temperate regions (Sutton et al., ). Whereas current increases in N deposition are occurring on a global scale (Bobbink et al., ), N-mediated threats to biodiversity are particularly pronounced for temperate forests, especially given the spatial coincidence of high human population density - and associated N pollution - with temperate forests (Holland & Lamarque, ), the disproportionate contribution of the herbaceous layer to temperate forest diversity (Gilliam, ), and the sensitivity of the forest herb community to excess N (Gilliam, ). More vexing still is that chronically elevated N deposition is occurring contemporaneously and, indeed, interactively with climate change (Maes et al., ).

              
Essentially all initial work on effects of excess N deposition on terrestrial ecosystems examined biogeochemical responses. These studies focused on changes in stream chemistry, generally showing increases in NO3- (from enhanced nitrification and leaching) and base cations (Ca++, Mg++ and K+) coupled with the movement of NO3- (Aber, ). Many areas of temperate forests of North America, especially those of the eastern United States, were shown to be sensitive to N saturation, a phenomenon which develops as atmospheric and microbial supply of available N exceeds biotic demand. Recent work has emphasized the effects of excess N on biodiversity of temperate forests (Thomas et al., ; Clark et al., ; Simkin et al., ). Despite considerable inter-site variability, a broad consensus is that excess N decreases forest biodiversity in temperate forests of North America.

              
Gilliam  provided a conceptual model to describe interactive processes that are sensitive to increased N loading in ways that can lead to loss of herb layer diversity, including altering interspecific competition, increasing herbivory and pathogenic fungal infection, inhibiting mycorrhizal associations and enhancing species invasions. Nitrogen-mediated declines in biodiversity are typically seen as loss of species in the herb layer from the increased cover of fewer nitrophilic species at the expense of numerous N-efficient species (Gilliam et al., ). Fewer studies have focused on responses of tree species to N. Thomas et al.  modelled the potential effects of N on temperate forest C sequestration and tree seedling survivorship. Chronically elevated N deposition enhanced C storage, but decreased survivorship in 8 of 11 common temperate tree species. Following N saturation, C sequestration is typically limited by another nutrient (Leuzinger & Hättenschwiler, ), often phosphorus (Gress et al., ).

              
Research focusing on chronically elevated N deposition leading to N saturation began in Europe much earlier than in North America, primarily because N-related threats appeared earlier and were far more widespread there (Gilliam, ). Although a notable amount of European work has been in the boreal region and in herb-dominated ecosystems, most recent work has been carried out in temperate forested regions, with much of that concerned with the response of the typically species-rich herbaceous layer to excess N, largely based on broad regional synthesis studies (De Schrijver et al., ; Verheyen et al., ; Dirnböck et al., ; Ferretti et al., ).

              
Borrowing a phrase from my home state of West Virginia, where coal mining is common, many N-effects studies in Europe use the forest herb layer community as 'the canary in a coal mine' (wherein caged canaries were once placed in a coal mine, whose death served as an early indication of impending peril for coal miners from coal gas). The wide spatial extent of sampling employed by these studies adds considerable validity and credibility to their findings. Verheyen et al.  compiled data from 1205 permanent/semi-permanent sample plots among 23 carefully selected understory resurvey studies. Utilizing a wide gradient in N deposition across deciduous temperate forests in Europe, they assessed the importance of factors influencing forest herb communities, including rate of N deposition, change in density of large herbivores, and change in forest canopy cover and composition. Their results demonstrated the interactive nature of these factors, concluding that N-mediated increases in nitrophilous species can be obscured by changes in the forest overstory. Similarly, Dirnböck et al.  synthesized long-term monitoring data from 1335 permanent samples among 28 forested sites from northern Fennoscandia to southern Italy, noting temporal trends in herb-layer species cover and diversity. They found a pattern of gradual replacement of N-efficient species by nitrophilous species in response to N deposition that was consistent on the European scale. Hedwall & Brunet  attempted to separate effects of global change and altered land-use in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden by documenting temporal variation in herb layer species over a 20-yr period in both boreal and temperate forests of Sweden, finding that most species changed in overall frequency. Comparing functional traits of both increasing and declining species, they found that current floristic dynamics were caused by combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition and changing land-use (e.g. plantation forestry). Herb species' changes were more pronounced in temperate, rather than boreal, forests.

              
Less is known regarding the effects of excess N on temperate forests of Asia (Liu et al., ) and the Southern Hemisphere. In China, this arises because of the chronically highly dissected extent of temperate forests (Liu, ) and the spatial distribution of highest amounts of N deposition occurring in tropical/sub-tropical regions (Lu et al., ). In addition to elevated rates of N emissions to the atmosphere (Liu et al., ), much of China's problems with excess N is associated with over-use of N fertilizers for summer maize agriculture (Zhang et al., ). Kim et al.  concluded that increases in N availability throughout Korea and Japan was most likely due to deposition of pollutant N from atmospheric sources from both industrial and agricultural regions. Perakis & Hedin  found that, as a result of their location relative to oceans, with prevailing winds coming off those oceans, forests of the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere receive some of the lowest annual rates of N deposition anywhere in the world (Godoy et al., ).

              
2. Altered phenology

              
Given that a prominent feature of all temperate forests is their distinct seasonality, phenology - seasonally recurring events of an organism's life cycle, for example, flowering, emergence of invertebrates, movement of migratory animals, and especially their timing and relationship with the physical environment - plays a key role in the structure and function of temperate forest ecosystems. For plants, phenological changes can be triggered by environmental cues, for example, chilling, spring temperature, growing degree days and daylight (Elmendorf et al., ). Because of their lack of thermoregulation, ectothermic animals (e.g. insects) can resemble plants with respect to environmental influences on and control of phenology, particularly temperature. Changes in phenology can affect several processes essential to survival, growth and reproduction of all organisms, especially critical when complex interspecific interactions are involved, such as plant-pollinator dynamics.

              
Many plant species are classified phenologically, based on seasonal patterns of flowering via photoperiod. Long-day plants flower in spring as day length increases, whereas short-day plants flower from late summer into the fall as day length decreases. Actually, it is the length of uninterrupted darkness that controls flowering, such that long-day plants are more accurately short-night plants and vice versa. Despite this importance of photoperiod, thermoperiod - daily and seasonal patterns of change in temperature - also affects virtually all phenologically controlled plant processes. Anecdotally, gardeners rue days of atypically warm temperatures in late winter that allow flower and leaf buds to break dormancy, only to be followed by seasonal temperatures < 0°C that kill new, susceptible tissues.

              
Evidence indicates that climate change has altered growing seasons in the temperate regions worldwide. Based on global meta-analyses of > 1700 wild species, including woody and herbaceous plants, birds, insects, amphibians and fish, Parmesan & Yohe  found widespread changes in phenology and species distributions attributable to climate warming. Despite some species' temporal stability, most exhibited change as predicted by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They found advancing spring events of 2.3 d/decade, and shifting biogeographical ranges toward the poles of 6.1 km per decade (Parmesan & Yohe, ), calling such changes a 'coherent fingerprint' of the overall effect of climate change on natural systems.

              
Ibáñez et al.  observed that climate warming has altered both spring and autumn phenologies of many species, but found considerable interspecific variation and, for a given species, spatial variation in response to climate change. Forecasting future change, they used a long-term (1953-2005) dataset including spring and autumn plant phenological events (flowering/leaf out and leaf coloring/leaf fall, respectively) of tree, shrub and herbaceous species of temperate forests of South Korea and Japan, finding that most species currently exhibit advanced spring phenology and delayed autumn phenology, consistent with expectations, but also that autumn-based changes are more rapid than those associated with spring. The latter observation contrasts with comparable studies in Europe which show that spring events are changing more rapidly than autumn events (Menzel et al., ).

              
For temperate forests, three relevant factors affecting the phenology of dominant tree species are photoperiod, degree of winter chilling and temperature (Körner & Basler, ). There is, however, interspecific variability in which predominant factor(s) control phenology among temperate forest species, with photoperiod increasing in importance with forest succession; that is, it is more important for long-lived, late-successional species than for short-lived, early-successional species. Although this may mitigate warming-induced change in temperate forest composition, Körner & Basler suggested that opportunistic (e.g. exotic invasive) species may benefit from a warming climate and claim a competitive advantage over photoperiod-sensitive species (Körner & Basler, ).

              
Altered phenology is a driver of change not only for plant species, but also for animal species, creating a complex scenario for plant-animal interactions, particularly pollination. Less a problem for climax canopy hardwood species, which are almost exclusively wind-pollinated, this is irrelevant for temperate conifers, but an especially serious threat for forest herbaceous species. Potts et al.  reviewed patterns of global declines in numerous pollinator species, with an understandable focus on insects - especially bees - considering that they are the primary pollinators of both agricultural crops and wild species. Potential drivers of pollinator loss include habitat loss/fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens and introductions of novel species. Also included is climate change, and interactions among virtually all drivers. Effects of climate change on insect pollinators are seen on all hierarchical levels of organization, from the individual to population and community levels. Especially troublesome are the temporal and spatial mismatches between plant species and their insect pollinators, arising temporally from changes in phenology of plant and insect species, and spatially from altered distributions (Potts et al., ).

              
Climate change-altered phenology has extended into changing life cycles among insects, an example of which is the mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae), native to western North America, and a generalist pest for the genus Pinus, often erupting epidemically, and killing wide swathes of trees throughout the region (Fig. a). Mitton & Ferrenberg  studied a recent epidemic of MPB that was an order of magnitude larger than ever recorded and extending to higher elevations/latitudes than on record. They demonstrated that, following 20 yr of increasing air temperatures in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the flight season of MPB began > 1 month earlier than historically known and extended twice that duration. More important was their novel finding that the life cycle of some broods of MPB increased from one to two generations per year (Fig. b). They explained that because this species lacks a diapause (suspension in development), its development is controlled solely by temperature. Accordingly, MPB populations currently respond to climate warming via faster development and expanse into previously inhospitable environments (Mitton & Ferrenberg, ). This work, however, was challenged by Bentz & Powell , who agreed that MPB is influenced by climate change, but stated that such studies need to consider thermally dependent traits that have evolved to maintain seasonality.

              
Climate change interactions have been reported for other forest pest insects. DeRose et al.  combined empirical data, based on US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis data, with three global change models to evaluate and predict the effect of increasing temperature on the distribution of spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), which attacks spruce forests of North America. They predicted that extent of attack should increase with temperature, but that there should be time lag in response, given the long-lived nature of host spruce trees.

              
This phenomenon is not confined to North America. Netherer & Schopf  reported similar findings from throughout Europe for defoliating insects, bark beetles and especially the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa), a defoliating insect for numerous conifer species. Its altitudinal and latitudinal distributions are controlled primarily by temperature and are already modified by climate change. Because of the prevailing oceanic climate in the Southern Hemisphere (i.e. generally lower temperatures during the growing season), climate change is predicted to promote contrasting effects on insect cycles there, as well (Deutsch et al., ).

              
Related to climate change-mitigated alterations in phenology are similarly altered changes in biogeographical ranges of species. Again, Parmesan & Yohe  concluded that climate change has caused mean pole-ward range shifts of 6.1 km per decade. Using seven global circulation models (GCMs), Hansen et al.  projected future distributions of prominent temperate forest types of North America, including the eastern deciduous forest and western mountain/coastal forests of the United States, focusing on major tree species. These models differ in their type - equilibrium vs transient - and in assumptions of change in temperature and precipitation. Equilibrium models are older and simulate instantaneous increases in CO2, being run until equilibrium climate conditions are reached; the more recent transient models assume increases in glasshouse gases at 1% yr-1 until 2100, allowing climatic adjustment. Although specific predicted outcomes for eastern forest species varied among models (Fig. ), all concurred in predicting profound shifts in dominant species, especially the virtual elimination the maple-beech-birch forest type (one of the more species-rich forest types of the region) and loblolly-shortleaf pine, and expansion of oak-hickory and oak-pine types (Fig. ). Potential ranges for several subalpine coniferous species are predicted to contract in the western United States (data not shown). Among their conclusions is that changes in climate and land use in the future will be of a magnitude to cause even greater changes in biodiversity. Although distributions of some species, communities and biomes are likely to expand, others will contract, creating novel communities (Hansen et al., ).

              
3. Drought/fire

              
In their now-classic paper, Hansen et al.  provided forecasts of several outcomes of global climate change using the three-dimensional model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. These included increased atmospheric warming globally, with degree of warming dependent on growth of trace gas emissions. Another prediction, one relevant for the present and future of global temperate forests, was a notable increase in the frequency of extremes of weather events and conditions. Indeed, this prediction is well-supported by current data collected by the Munchener Ruckversicherungs-Gesellschaft, Geo Risks Research, NatCatSERVICE, wherein they examined global annual frequency of catastrophic disturbances 1980-2014 (Fig. ). All types of catastrophic disturbance, save earthquakes, have increased during this period. These are true extremes, indeed, considering that frequencies of both flooding and drought exhibit large increases over the c. 35 yr time period. Relevant to the current discussion is the increased frequency of drought, a disturbance not directly associated with any particular biome, but representing an especially serious threat to temperate forests (Fig. ).

              
Forests typically develop in the temperate zone wherever there is sufficient precipitation to maintain soil moisture amounts capable of supporting tree growth and survival. Thus, the occurrence of extensive drought will have directly damaging effects on tree species. In addition to the direct limitations of drought-induced moisture stress, however, is the drought-induced increase in the frequency of fire. Wildfire activity has not only been predicted to increase in the future under a climate warming scenario, but also such increases are hypothesized to bring about biogeographical shifts that reduce the resilience of fire-prone forests worldwide (Harvey et al., ). Although the relative contribution of fire to forest decline is greatest in the boreal forest, fire still represents a threat to temperate forests, especially conifer forests already weakened by drought (Hansen et al., ). Harvey et al.  tested two hypotheses associated with this observation in fire-prone subalpine (largely conifer) forests in the Rocky Mountains of the United States: (1) availability of viable seeds will decrease in large patches following stand-replacing fire, and (2) seedling establishment and survival will decline measurably following post-fire drought. They found that total tree seedling establishment declined sharply post-fire with greater drought severity and with greater distance to seed source. Many responses exhibited interspecific variation, suggesting fire/drought-induced changes in forest composition. They concluded that, given the predicted increase in frequency of drought and wildfire in the future, post-fire tree seedling establishment of these forests could be reduced substantially. Although some of these reductions might be offset by compensatory increases from lower montane and upper timberline species, important near- to mid-term shifts in the composition and structure of high-elevation forests will occur under continued climate warming and increased wildfire activity.

              
Not part of their study, yet no less important, is the interaction of drought and fire with increases in extent and severity of forests pests, as discussed in Mitton & Ferrenberg  in North America and Netherer & Schopf  in Europe. That is, the scene depicted in Fig. (a) of wide swathes of insect-killed stems is of trees more susceptible to insect death because of drought stress, and simultaneously represents substantial fuel for intense fires. Furthermore, McDowell et al.  established a close connection between climate change-enhanced drought and increases in pests for temperate forests of North America.

V. Epilogue

              
Regrettably, climate change has been insinuated into the current political arena - especially in the United States, but also elsewhere around the world - wherein agenda-driven politics seek to deny its scientific reality (I remind my students that mixing politics and science is like mixing manure and ice cream - it never helps the manure, but always ruins the ice cream). In spite of this, and to a real degree because of it, climate change will continue to threaten global ecosystems in general, and temperate forests in particular, for many years in the future. It is quite compelling that, in spite of misrepresentations to the contrary, numerous long-term predictions from the past regarding climate change have largely survived scientific scrutiny. Certainly, predictions of Hansen et al.  nearly 30 yr ago have all been essentially supported, especially regarding climate change-mediated extremes of weather (Fig. ).

              
Climate change, however, is only a part, albeit the lion's share, of global change, comprising myriad other drivers, most of which have been exposited herein. Franklin et al.  developed a conceptual model of the effects of these drivers - climate change, altered disturbance regimes, invasive species/novel species assemblages, land-use change - on terrestrial ecosystems using multiple lines of evidence. These include observations for attribution, experiments for identifying mechanisms, and use of models at multiple scales of ecological organization for verification (Fig. ). Although this model was developed as a set of general guidelines for all ecosystems of the biosphere, it seems particularly applicable to temperate forests, considering (1) the chronic alteration of these forests by human populations, and (2) their temperate nature, wherein growing/dormant seasons are an integral part of their structure and function. Such a model provides a strong base not only for ongoing scientific inquiry and understanding, but also in informing mitigation policy. Although the science to date has provided sufficient evidence providing the impetus for policy changes, there is still a clear need for further basic scientific research. Climate change is unquestionably a complex phenomenon that can be best understood only by a complex of scientific approaches, involving empirical field monitoring, manipulative field experiments and laboratory simulations, all coupled with modeling (e.g. DeRose et al., ).

              
Finally, I suspect that I am not alone among plant ecologists in considering Sir Arthur Tansley as a professional 'hero,' a truly inspirational visionary in our field, and one who clearly articulated many ecological concepts we embrace today. Although it is an honor to write a review bearing his name, I cannot imagine that he, in his day, would have conceived the truly global scale of our 'modern' alteration of climate. Still, he deeply appreciated the profoundly negative influence human activity can have on the very ecosystems that he not only 'coined,' but on which our sustainability depends. Appropriately, I allow Sir Arthur to conclude:

              
It would be difficult, not to say impossible, to draw a natural line between the activities of the human tribes which presumably fitted into and formed parts of 'biotic communities' and the destructive human activities of the modern world...Regarded as an exceptionally powerful biotic factor which increasingly upsets the equilibrium of preexisting ecosystems and eventually destroys them, at the same time forming new ones of very different nature, human activity finds its proper place in ecology. Tansley

Summary

              
Humans have long utilized resources from all forest biomes, but the most indelible anthropogenic signature has been the expanse of human populations in temperate forests. The purpose of this review is to bring into focus the diverse forests of the temperate region of the biosphere, including those of hardwood, conifer and mixed dominance, with a particular emphasis on crucial challenges for the future of these forested areas. Implicit in the term 'temperate' is that the predominant climate of these forest regions has distinct cyclic, seasonal changes involving periods of growth and dormancy. The specific temporal patterns of seasonal change, however, display an impressive variability among temperate forest regions. In addition to the more apparent current anthropogenic disturbances of temperate forests, such as forest management and conversion to agriculture, human alteration of temperate forests is actually an ancient phenomenon, going as far back as 7000 yr before present (bp). As deep-seated as these past legacies are for temperate forests, all current and future perturbations, including timber harvesting, excess nitrogen deposition, altered species' phenologies, and increasing frequency of drought and fire, must be viewed through the lens of climate change.

T1  - Plant volatile-mediated signalling and its application in agriculture: successes and challenges
AN  - 1836942685
AB  - 856

I. Introduction

              
Volatile secondary metabolites of plants can provide signals acting as recognition cues for detection and colonization by other organisms, most obviously insects. Where crops are concerned, these insects join pathogens and weeds as major constraints to food production. In modern agriculture, such constraints are managed by a range of synthetic and largely eradicant pesticides. Apart from the often rapid development of resistance in the pest, pathogen or weed, these are registered for use in ways avoiding risk to human and environmental health (Pickett, ). However, for more sustainable pest management than seasonal, and often multi-seasonal, deployment of pesticides, crop resistance to pests, delivered via the seed, will be essential (Baulcombe, ).

              
Crop breeding programmes, now advanced by new molecular techniques, have provided evidence for the value of seed-delivered pest management. Evidence for the value of a wider range of genetic pest resistance than provided by the often closely related crop varieties used in breeding programmes is demonstrated by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crops. These express, by genetic modification (GM), genes for proteins based on the sequences of insect endotoxins from B. thuringiensis, with associated increases in sustainability (Lu et al., ). Advances in the molecular biology of plant secondary metabolite regulation and biosynthesis now render such compounds targets for exploitation by GM in agriculture. In choosing specific pest targets, particularly insects, plant volatile-mediated signalling offers a further advantage in that the modes of action do not involve toxic mechanisms, which can negatively impact public perception. This is specifically a consideration with insects which, although a class of Arthropods, are animals, and the sites of action for many insecticides are common not only to both pest and beneficial insects, but also to vertebrate animals, including human beings. For insects, the signalling receptor systems are essentially similar to human olfactory recognition but, although the signal compounds involved can be detected by human olfaction, this detection is very seldom as sensitive, and usually without a specific signalling role. In plants and pathogens, although there are no peripheral sensory nervous systems as for animals, the volatile signals are detected by sophisticated systems (see Section VI). Thus, by exploiting natural plant genetic diversity in breeding, by the use of companion plants and by creating new GM plants with modified volatile-mediated signalling systems, we are set to exploit this approach to reducing pest-, disease- and weed-related constraints in agriculture.

              
Plant signalling via volatile secondary metabolites allows recognition not only of hosts, but also of nonhosts. These may, by being taxonomically different from host plants, have features such as toxic metabolites to which a potential pest is poorly adapted, or unadapted. Host plants rapidly become nonhosts during feeding or as a consequence of other developmental stresses, and this results in signalling to successive invaders that the initial host is no longer appropriate. The realization that taxonomically based nonhost signalling could be related to damage stress signalling by colonized hosts (Nottingham et al.,) was an important development in working towards strategies for use of volatile-mediated signalling in agriculture. The further appreciation that this latter type of volatile signal could also induce, or prime, plant defence (Baldwin & Schultz, ; Baldwin et al., ) adds considerable power to developing new plant control strategies by providing plant-to-plant signals as a means to switch on defence genes in a companion crop. These can be identified from the natural diversity of plant species or utilized from a GM plant engineered specifically for this purpose.

              
Elicitors from plant-attacking organisms are now being characterized generally as small-molecular-weight lipophilic secondary metabolites, after the pioneering identification of volicitin from the regurgitant material of an herbivorous caterpillar (Alborn et al., ). Other elicitors with novel structures, but similar physicochemical properties, have been identified (Alborn et al., ) from different insect taxa and again require, as for volicitin, damage by the herbivore for the compound to elicit defence responses in the plant. The type of defence elicited could be direct (Oliver et al., ; Scholz et al., ), or produced as indirect volatile defence signals in which compounds repellent to the herbivore, but attractive to organisms antagonistic to the herbivore (e.g. parasitoids), are elicited (Alborn et al., ; Scholz et al., ). The natural elicitors of defence offer opportunities for nonconstitutive defence gene expression and can thereby be linked to pest presence, in contrast to the prophylactic treatments using constitutive gene expression currently deployed in GM crops.

              
Here, we review the above aspects, particularly in terms of application to agriculture, of volatile-mediated signalling in crops and wild plants. We then describe the successful push-pull system for managing lepidopterous stemborer pests of cereals in sub-Saharan Africa by delivery of signals using companion cropping. Challenges will then be discussed for delivery to industrial agriculture of pest management signalling, specifically by GM.

II. Plant volatile-mediated host signalling

              
This is an extensively studied area and offers a great range of tools for trapping pest insects. However, crops themselves are highly effective competitors to artificial delivery of these signals. The signals can relate to the volatile chemistry of plants generally. Specificity can be exhibited by mixtures of ubiquitous signals (Bruce & Pickett, ), which include oxidation products, for example (E)-2-hexenal and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol from the lipoxygenase pathway, and their derivatives, for example (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. It has been possible, using gas chromatography-coupled electrophysiology with the insect antenna (either electroantennography or single neuron recording) (Pickett et al., , ), to identify and quantify complex mixtures which, in the laboratory, mimic the natural signal (Webster et al., ). For example, the signal used by the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, in detecting its host, the bean Vicia faba, incorporates a 16-component mixture of ubiquitous plant volatiles (Webster et al., ) (Table ). However, such a mixture would be extremely difficult to deliver artificially. Usually, individual components are detected by specific olfactory neurons (Blight et al., ; Hansson et al., ). For example, aphid detection of (E)-2-hexenal is by a neuron that barely responds to closely related compounds from the same biosynthetic pathway (Pickett et al., ). This allows recognition between components of a mixture released from a point source, as opposed to from diverse points (Baker et al., ; Baker, ; Bruce & Pickett, ).

              
For artificial delivery, although a range of slow-release formulations and devices are available (Bruce et al., ; Bakry et al., ), components of a mixture having different volatilities present practical problems, currently solved only by using separate release substrates and thereby separate release points for the individual components. Opportunities exist for exploiting Raoult's law, as shown by Heath et al. (), which states that the partial vapour pressure of each compound of an ideal mixture of liquids is equal to the vapour pressure of the pure component, multiplied by its mole fraction in the mixture. This presents a completely novel opportunity for delivery of complex mixtures while maintaining an essential ratio of release between compounds of widely differing volatilities, and protection of intellectual property (IP) for new developments is being considered. However, delivery of competitive, and even superior, host signals from companion plants is a reality, and is the goal for the 'pull' plants in the push-pull or stimulo-deterrent diversionary system, originally proposed by Miller & Cowles () and discussed in detail in Section VII. Highly attractive trap plants, on which eggs are laid but larvae cannot develop, also have the advantage of facilitating destruction of the attracted herbivore, for example by the leaf and stem material being fed to farm animals. Alternatively, traps designed to kill the herbivore are required and, although insecticides can be deployed, mechanical entrapment by surfactant-treated water or adhesives is preferred (Bruce et al., , ).

              
Volatile-mediated signalling associated with specific host taxa can provide signals delivered more simply than for attractive mixtures. Such signals can relate to toxicants to which specialist herbivores have become evolutionarily adapted. Thus, volatile organic isothiocyanates can be used by herbivorous insects specializing on plant families of the order Brassicales, which contain toxic glucosinolates releasing isothiocyanates by catabolism within the plant (Halkier & Gershenzon, ). Although specific olfactory neurons respond to the organic isothiocyanates, these compounds can be further discriminated by neurons in antennae of, for example, the cabbage seed weevil, Ceutorhynchus assimilis, responding to specific structural types of organic isothiocyanates (Blight et al., ). These signals can be used competitively in brassicaceous crops by incorporation into lures slowly releasing the compounds to attract pests into traps (Smart et al., ; Blight & Smart, ). However, intrinsic toxicity and instability of the organic isothiocyanates present problems and so, again, companion cropping has been studied as an option (Cook et al., , ). Further examples of taxonomically based signalling beyond the brassicaceous glucosinolate/isothiocyanate system and the more widespread cyanogenic glycoside systems exist, but there are relatively few that are understood ecologically, compared with the number of plants defended by highly toxic secondary metabolites. It is currently assumed that recognition of hosts relies mainly on mixture recognition, but it may be that we have as yet been unable to recognize the associated specific volatile signals. Thus, a profitable approach to this problem may lie in the study of the molecular basis of insect olfactory recognition. As the insect olfactory system is linked to the motor neuronal responses of behaviour via the central nervous system, learning also plays an important role (Webster et al., ) in natural molecular structure recognition by olfaction. This latter aspect of signalling represents another unique feature for insects and animals generally, as opposed to signalling in other kingdoms, including fungi and plants, which is not always appreciated when developing new strategies for agriculture.

III. Plant volatile-mediated nonhost signalling

              
From an evolutionary standpoint, nonhost signalling is largely advantageous to an organism attacking a plant. Thus, when plants are attacked, they can signal to other organisms, particularly herbivorous insects, which would not derive value from a host already colonized because, as well as competition for host resources, there could be cannibalism of eggs or early-stage larvae by larger, conspecific larvae. Nonetheless, the plants can benefit by recruitment of organisms antagonistic to those at the herbivorous, or second trophic, level. The nature of such chemical signalling can be as for the original host recognition, but can also involve perturbation of mixture composition by the production of higher concentrations of certain components, or overall increased release, as a consequence of oxidation reactions associated with plant tissue damage. Indeed, perturbation of mixtures by increased amounts of components of host recognition mixtures, for example the isoprenoid oxidation product 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one in the background of wheat (Triticum aestivum) flower volatiles, causes repellency of the orange wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Birkett et al., ). Single compounds originating from damage-related oxidation, such as (E)-2-hexenal, can act as individual compounds in the recognition mixture for V. faba, but cause repellency of A. fabae when presented alone (Webster et al., ). Other isoprenoid oxidation products such as the so-called homoterpenes (more correctly termed tetranorterpenes), comprising C11 and C16 isoprenoids [e.g. (E,E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT)](Table ), derived by oxidation of the tertiary alcohols relating to higher isoprenoidal homologues, that is, C15 (sesquiterpene) and C20 (diterpene), are ubiquitous signals for host plants no longer valuable as hosts as a consequence of prior damage (Tholl et al., ).

              
In certain ecological situations, the isoprenoid oxidation products such as 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one can signal to higher trophic levels, for example the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi, indicating the presence of its host, the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Du et al., ). Thus, A. ervi, when parasitizing aphids feeding on fabaceous plants, has a potential host range that includes A. fabae and the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae. However, this particular signal allows recognition of its specific host, A. pisum, which causes the plant to produce the signal. Studies on aphid elicitors of defence are progressing (Box et al., ; Pitino & Hogenhout, ; Zust & Agrawal, ), but such specificity has not yet been explained although, unlike other insect elicitors previously identified, they are characterized as aphid-derived effector proteins. The tetranorterpenes are also ubiquitous in signalling foraging behaviour in a wide range of predators and parasitoids (Tholl et al., ). These compounds are highly volatile and unstable, but can be exploited by release from 'push' plants in the push-pull system, which is discussed later in Section VII. Also under investigation is engineering of genes for biosynthesis of their precursors as sesquiterpene and diterpene secondary alcohols, and for the oxidative production of the tetranorterpenes (Lee et al., ; Brillada et al., ; Birkett & Pickett, ), potentially for exploitation by GM in answer to the challenge of targeting nonpheromonal signals for plant protection (see Section VIII).

              
The type of nonhost signalling considered previously can also include taxonomically specific signals because of the similarity, from an evolutionary standpoint, of nonhosts appearing as such through herbivore damage and via taxonomy to which the herbivore has not adapted. Indeed, although the plant volatile methyl salicylate was studied primarily as a plant stress-related signal (Shulaev et al., ; Agelopoulos et al., ), we had observed previously that it can indicate a plant as being a nonhost, as defined by taxonomy. This phenomenon was reported originally in host-alternating aphid species where a seasonal host, for example the winter or primary host, has nonhost characteristics for aphids searching for the summer or secondary host (Hardie et al., ; Pettersson et al., ). cis-Jasmone, formally related to the plant hormone jasmonic acid, was discovered initially as a host signal from Ribis nigrum, the winter host of the lettuce aphid, Nasonovia ribis-nigri, and is also responsible for its repellency from the summer host, lettuce, Lactuca sativa (Birkett et al., ). cis-Jasmone was subsequently shown to act generally as a repellent of insect herbivores and as a recruiting signal for higher trophic level antagonists, such as ladybirds and parasitoids of other insect species having a taxonomically diverse host range.

IV. Plant volatile-mediated signalling between plants via air

              
Related to nonhost signalling, plant-to-plant signalling is mostly considered as stress-related signalling from one plant to another of the same species, that is, phytopheromones, although other taxa can be responsive to the phytopheromones of particular species (Fig. ). As a consequence of observing the wider role of cis-jasmone in signalling to higher trophic levels (Birkett et al., ), thereby recruiting insects attacking herbivores, further studies demonstrated a role in inducing plant defence, initially in V. faba and then in Arabidopsis thaliana, and crop plants including cereals (Bruce et al., ; Pickett et al., ). cis-Jasmone, although related to jasmonic acid, signals differently (Matthes et al., , ) and is probably produced, rather than from jasmonate via oxidative decarboxylation, via isomerization of 12-oxophytodienoic acid (Dabrowska et al., ), for which further evidence is emerging (Matsui et al., ). Nonetheless, cis-jasmone is volatile by merit of having lost the carboxylic acid group, whereas methyl jasmonate is volatile as a consequence of esterification (Birkett et al., ). This is analogous to the creation of the volatile, and thereby external, stress signal methyl salicylate by esterification of the plant stress hormone salicylate (Agelopoulos et al., ).

              
cis-Jasmone is capable of inducing defence in many plant species without the deleterious effects associated with methyl jasmonate and other jasmonates. [beta]-Aminobutyric acid (BABA) is also known to prime plants (Baccelli & Mauch-Mani, ), although this can cause conflicting phytotoxic effects. Nonetheless, priming is a crucially important aspect of defence and in-depth studies with such tools are leading to a more exploitable understanding of this phenomenon (Balmer et al., ). Jasmonates can prime plants for defence, but the results can be erratic (Smart et al., ). Although there are many underpinning issues, the molecular mechanisms by which a memory effect of jasmonate-mediated defence responses is obtained have been elucidated (Galis et al., ). For cis-jasmone, the priming effect can be potentially valuable, for example against leaf hoppers, such as Cicadulina storeyi, a vector of maize streak virus (Oluwafemi et al., ).

              
A number of other plant stress-related volatiles can also show induction of defence and priming, including lipoxygenase pathway products (Engelberth et al., ). Indole, a more recently identified stress-related volatile plant priming signal (Erb et al., ), shows considerable promise for practical development and also has a potential role in direct defence against herbivory (Veyrat et al., ). Successful experimental field trials in wheat against the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae, showed long-term protection after defensive genes were switched on by an electrostatically sprayed aqueous formulation of cis-jasmone as an emulsifiable concentrate (Bruce et al., ). In laboratory experiments, similarly encouraging results were obtained for cis-jasmone-induced attraction of the egg parasitoid, Telenomus podisi, of soybean stink bug pests (Moraes et al., ), antixenosis against the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii (Hegde et al., ), and increased parasitoid behaviour against the aphid Aulacorthum solani on sweet pepper Capsicum annuum in the glasshouse (Dewhirst et al., ). The cis-jasmone-induced indirect defence, in each case, involved signalling with volatile oxidation products of the isoprenoid pathway, including the tetranorterpenes (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT) and TMTT. Extensive commercial field trials have been made with cis-jasmone as a defence elicitor on a range of crops around the world, but the results, although sometimes excellent, are too erratic for further development. As a consequence, growth stimulant effects were noticed, demonstrating a new role for cis-jasmone as a volatile plant-derived signal. Further patents were commercially filed, including for use in growth stimulation and greening in amenity turf (Skillman et al., ; Haas & Grimm, ; Haas et al., ). Such turf is a mixture of grasses, including the annual meadow or blue grass, Poa annua, which are largely unimproved genetically and are generally the same as wild-type species. We believe it is likely that there are wild-type traits promoting responses to natural elicitors, and that this relates to the more erratic nature of herbivory-induced defence volatiles found across commercial varieties (Kappers et al., ).

              
Because grasses are closely related to commercial cereal crops, understanding this phenomenon in grasses may give a lead to further genetic improvement of such crops. Also, the role of wild-type grasslands in providing ecosystem services, including habitats for beneficial insects, and in mitigating climate change by carbon sequestration (Lamb et al., ), could perhaps be exploited further via cis-jasmone signalling using a sentinel plant concept (Birkett & Pickett, ). A sensitive sentinel plant emitting cis-jasmone, when appropriate conditions appear, could switch on growth when nutrients, water and sunlight are not limiting in the main wild grassland stand or crop of related grasses. Nonetheless, more will need to be understood, particularly with regard to the transcriptional responses of these volatile plant-derived signals, before we can fully realize their potential (Paschold et al., ). However, new evidence of the potential regulation of phytohormonal regulators such as cytokinins via bioactive responses to stress may show a putative mechanism for exploiting regulators such as cis-zeatin-type cytokinins (Schafer et al., ), using plant volatile-mediated signalling.

V. Plant volatile-mediated signalling between plants through soil

              
As long ago as 2001 (Birkett et al., ; Chamberlain et al., ) we, together with Emilio Guerrieri (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Fransesco Pennacchio, University of Basilicata, Italy) and Guy Poppy (University of Southampton, UK) reported that, when plants were damaged by aphid feeding, signals passed through the natural rhizosphere to neighbouring undamaged plants, resulting in induced defence which included volatile-mediated signalling, negatively to aphids and positively to aphid parasitoids. This was also demonstrated when the plants were grown hydroponically and the signal remained in the aqueous medium after the damaged plant was removed, with the signal acting on an intact replacement plant. However, in spite of the convenience of being able to explore this phenomenon in an aqueous medium, we have not yet completed chemical characterization of the rhizosphere-signalling system, although we have characterized the resulting volatile-mediated signalling to insects at the two trophic levels.

              
More recently, together with David Johnson's group (University of Aberdeen, UK) and others, we have shown that an extremely powerful signalling system exists where aphid-damaged plants are connected by mycelial networks of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, bean plants, V. faba, rendered repellent to the pea aphid, A. pisum, and attractive to its parasitoid, A. ervi, by aphid feeding, transferred these properties to intact plants when connected via a shared mycorrhizal fungal network (Babikova et al., ). Other potential connections were mechanically obstructed, leaving the mycelial network shown unambiguously to be responsible. There was no suggestion that plant volatile-mediated signals affecting the insect behaviour were translocated in the system. The systemic fungal signals travelling between plants through the rhizosphere by means of the fungal network will be difficult to capture for characterization, although molecular biological approaches may facilitate these further studies. It is evident that this signalling moves within the rhizosphere between plants relatively rapidly, that is, starting within 24 h from initial insect infestation (Babikova et al., ), which implies a clear developmental benefit to the plants receiving the signal (Heil & Ton, ; Heil & Adame-Alvarez, ). The role of fungal networks in this general context is an expanding area of study (Pozo & Azcón-Aguilar, ; Song et al., ; Cosme et al., ), particularly in connection with induction of resistance to root pathogens (Whipps, ) and nematodes (de la Peña et al., ). The potential for direct transmission of soil allelochemicals via mycorrhizal networks has been considered (Barto et al., ) and these could potentially induce the volatile-mediated signalling by the signal-receiving plant. Although the likelihood of chemically mediated signalling in this system is widely acknowledged, it is suggested that electrical signalling may enable transmissions over relatively long distances (Johnson & Gilbert, ).

              
Surprisingly, transmission of volatile lipophilic compounds through the soil is relatively facile (Bateman et al., ; Chamberlain et al., ). This is not yet widely appreciated in the signalling literature. However, highly volatile pesticides such as tefluthrin (Jutsum et al., ) achieve valuable soil mobility against insect pests in the rhizosphere. These compounds are rendered volatile by incorporation of a high level of fluorine substitution which precludes molecular cohesion, as with perfluorocarbon polymers in 'nonstick' cooking and other devices. Turling's group has dramatically demonstrated volatile-mediated rhizosphere signalling in which maize (Zea mays) plant roots, damaged by larvae of corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, release the volatile sesquiterpene hydrocarbon (E)-(1R,9S)-caryophyllene to attract entomophagous nematodes (Rasmann et al., ). Thus, in a population density-dependent manner, a root-feeding herbivore uses an induced plant volatile as an aggregation cue (Robert et al., ) and as a means to make host selection (Robert et al., ). The value of this approach has been demonstrated in the field (Degenhardt et al., ), and approaches to raising the level of this type of volatile-mediated signalling in the rhizosphere are being explored by breeding and supplementing the entomophagous nematode population (Köllner et al., ; Turlings et al., ).

              
Other types of volatile-mediated signalling in the rhizosphere are being studied, but the technology required for such work needs further improvement. For example, a recent demonstration of volatile-mediated signalling involving sesquiterpenes from ectomycorrhizal fungi influencing root architecture claims an isomer of thujopsene to be responsible (Ditengou et al., ). However, we notice that the work failed to characterize the compound by formally recognized analytical protocols, although an authentic sample of the thujopsene compound demonstrated the activity claimed.

              
It is suggested that volatile-mediated signalling in the rhizosphere can occur directly via common mycorrhizal networks between plants, providing a 'network enhanced bioactive zone' by which the volatile signals are preserved from soil degradation, and that this process enhances transmission between the plants (Barto et al., ). In that publication, the chemical signals are termed 'infochemicals', which is both technically and taxonomically unsatisfactory, as the term 'semiochemical' should be used where there is evidence of a signalling role. However, it is an interesting proposition. Further work would require studies targeting rhizosphere semiochemicals with narrow ranges of lipophilicity, for example, log/octanol/water coefficients (Chamberlain et al., ), to dissect, and test separately, various hypotheses relating to the physical properties of the semiochemicals by which they would influence the mode of transmission. This could then include a route via the internal cytoplasmic region of the hyphae and the air passage created as a hyphal cord interior. The subject of rhizosphere organisms using volatile signals in communicating with plants is rapidly expanding (Sánchez-López et al., ). For example, the aerial volatile signal indole, referred to in Section IV (Erb et al., ), is also produced as a signal by rhizosphere organisms, thereby promoting root development by interfering with auxin signalling via the plant.

              
Another analogy between rhizosphere and terrestrial plant volatile-mediated signalling is that, just as plants linked by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi transfer messages between plants, causing stress-related signalling, so plants linked by parasitic plants such as the dodder, Cuscuta pentagona, may also signal between plants. In this case, mRNAs have been shown moving at high levels and in a bidirectional manner across the species (Kim et al., ). Thus, cues transmitted from the plants instigating plant signalling could be mediated by mRNAs. This is also recognized as being a general mechanism for communication between the kingdoms involving small RNA (sRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) (Weiberg et al., ). This could relate to the arbuscular mycorrhizal plant-plant interactions that initiate indirect defence in unattacked plants (Babikova et al., ).

              
Clearly, we need to work towards overcoming major challenges to using mycorrhizal signalling by further chemical and molecular characterization of the mechanisms by which volatile-mediated signalling is effected via rhizosphere signalling. However, in the meantime, it may be possible empirically to exploit, for example, common mycelial networks to induce defence in the main stand of crop plants after initial attack on sacrificial, susceptible sentinel plants grown as companion intercrops (Fig. ). This could be attempted by choosing a fabaceous crop and establishing mycorrhizal connections to include susceptible plants, even comprising different species from the main crop, which would thereby perform the role of sentinel plants.

VI.

              
VI. Plant volatile-mediated signal transduction

              
So far, we do not have a generic understanding of the signal transduction processes for volatile-mediated signalling to plants. Although the volatile small lipophilic molecules (SLMs) involved are often from structural groups related by their biosynthetic routes, it appears that the compounds are recognized as specific molecules, rather than there being generic 'odour' recognition (Birkett et al., ; Erb et al., ). This is analogous to animal and particularly insect olfaction, where specific molecular recognition is the normal process (Blight et al., ; Hansson et al., ), with apparent general recognition being only at very high stimulus concentrations. Clearly, lessons are to be learnt from hormone receptors and, not least, receptors for the strigolactones. These are carotenoid-derived plant hormones active externally in the rhizosphere, regulating development processes including plant, particularly root, architecture and availability of plant nutrients. In this system, recognition and response involve proteins described originally for both monocots and dicots as [alpha]/[beta]-fold hydrolases, for example proteins such as D14 in rice (Oryza sativa), and generally leucine-rich-repeat F-box proteins discussed by Lechner et al. (), for example MAX2 referred to in Arabidopsis by Al-Babili & Bouwmeester (). The further transduction process is elaborated and reviewed, and the molecular recognition mechanism for the [alpha]/[beta]-fold hydrolase type protein explained, by Seto & Yamaguchi (). Such developments have underpinned further structure-function studies specifically targeting receptors in the parasitic weed genus Striga, which employ strigolactones in the rhizosphere for host location (Toh et al., ). Essential structural features of signalling strigolactones, involving the D-ring and its enzymatic detachment to give a hydroxybutenolide (Zwanenburg et al., ), relate to the volatile signal 3-methyl-2H-furo(2,3-c)-pyran-2-one (karrikinolide-1), which is released by the pyrolysis of plant tissue in wildfires and stimulates germination of the seeds of succession plants.

              
These hydroxybutenolide signals also have a structural analogy with volatile plant stress signals such as cis-jasmone. For this karrikinolide, it is clear that molecular recognition involves the [alpha]/[beta] hydrolase proteins, including KA12 described in Arabidopsis by Guo et al. (). For cis-jasmone, the receptor system has not been elucidated. However, the up-regulation of specific genes by cis-jasmone in Arabidopsis may indicate involvement of, and specifically includes, an F-box protein gene (At2g4413036). Also up-regulated is a cytochrome p450, CYP81D11 (At3g28740), and this, by a protein interaction with cis-jasmone, could be the basis of recognition. Certainly, knockout plants interfering with the functionality of CYP81D11 are deficient in positive parasitoid responses found for the wild-type Arabidopsis (Matthes et al., ). A heptadeuterated cis-jasmone was synthesized (A. Hooper, unpublished), but appropriately labelled reaction products via the CYP81D11 could not be found (M. Birkett, unpublished). Volatile plant-derived signals can contribute directly to the signalling transduction process. For example, it has been shown that herbivore-damaged tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants release (Z)-3-hexenol. This is then taken up by intact plants and converted to (Z)-3-hexenylvicianoside which, via a mechanism independent of jasmonates, negatively affects the performance of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura (Sugimoto et al., ).

              
While we await definitive characterization of molecular recognition and transduction processes for volatile-mediated signalling to plants, we can use emerging synthetic biological approaches in the design of new signals and genes for their biosynthesis. For example, analogues of (S)-germacrene D, a potent stress related aphid repellent, cannot rationally be designed from docking studies with the associated olfactory proteins from the insects. However, a novel approach, in which nonnatural substrates of the plant synthase gene for (S)-germacrene D are fed to the enzyme, yields products that have sufficient similarity, in terms of the chemical space of the original ligand, that activity is rationally achieved (Touchet et al., ). The generality of the approach is now being explored with another plant-derived signal, epizingiberene, as a whitefly repellent (Allemann et al., ) and could be applied to other natural plant signals difficult to deploy directly, such as the tetranorterpenes DMNT and TMTT (Fig. ).

VII. Success and lessons from exploiting plant volatile-mediated signalling by companion cropping: push-pull

              
The push-pull system has come to embody a platform for delivery of weed control, plant nutrition and forage for animal husbandry, in addition to pest management for smallholder cereal farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it began as a companion cropping system against lepidopterous stemborer pests (Khan et al., ; Pickett et al., ). Initially, the cattle forage grass Melinis minutiflora provided a 'push' by repelling gravid stemborer moths, including the indigenous Busseola fusca and the exotic Chilo partellus from maize, with which it is grown as an intercrop. Although identified as having this role empirically, gas chromatography-coupled electroantennography (GC-EAG) and behavioural studies then demonstrated that the tetranorterpene DMNT was largely responsible for defending the maize with which M. minutiflora was intercropped. At the same time, it was discovered that this also resulted in substantially higher parasitism, for example by Cotesia sesamiae, of those stemborer larvae that were still able to infest the maize (Khan et al., ). The 'pull' was provided by other cattle forage grasses, for example Pennisetum purpureum and Sorghum vulgare sudanense, that showed attractancy to gravid lepidopterous stemborers by release of high concentrations of ubiquitous plant volatile signals.

              
It has since been suggested that less agriculturally developed grasses such as P. purpureum and Hyparrhenia rufa release vastly more host recognition signals at the beginning of the scotophase than do cereal crop plants, contributing to the role of wild grasses as superior hosts (Chamberlain et al., ). This offers a rare example, but one with growing exemplification (e.g. de Lange et al., ), of where there is an apparent evolutionary disadvantage for domesticated crop plants over related wild types. Nonetheless, the issue needs further study for wider exploitation. This also relates to earlier discussions on stress-related signalling to turf grasses, in which these less genetically improved species retain a greater signalling potential. A recent review of the mechanical framework of push-pull has made interesting observations on approaches to improve push-pull control of insects (Eigenbrode et al., ). It was suggested that this system, developed initially for pest management in sub-Saharan Africa, did not study short-range interventions between plants and insects. However, in the papers (Khan et al., , ), evidence is provided on the value of short-range attractancy by the trap crop P. purpureum to the stemborer moths B. fusca and C. partellus. Eigenbrode et al. () propose various potential push-pull interventions but, for many, the signalling aspect is probably too weak to be effective and, also, the companion plants do not have value for farmers other than their role in crop protection.

              
In some regions where push-pull is practised, other intercrops have replaced M. minutiflora, for example forage legumes in the genus Desmodium, because, as well as controlling insect pests, plants in this genus specifically control parasitic weeds such as Striga hermonthica, in addition to fixing nitrogen within the system. This type of push-pull has been extended to many other cereal crops suffering damage by lepidopterous stemborers and parasitic weeds, including sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (Khan et al., ), pearl millet, Pennisetum glaucum, finger millet, Eleusine coracana (Midega et al., ), and rain-fed rice, that is, NERICA (NEw RICe for Africa from Oryza glaberrima and O. sativa) (Pickett et al., ). New work on drought-tolerant companion crops for protecting sorghum, for example Desmodium intortum and the apomictic hybrid forage grass Brachiaria Mulato II, have been developed to accommodate the aridification of cereal-growing regions as a consequence of climate change (Pickett et al., ; Midega et al., ; Murage et al., ). Take-up in smallholder farmsteads is over 120 000, with a considerably faster growth rate for climate-smart push-pull comprising drought-tolerant plants, and the increasing proportion of women 1.7 : 1 (Fig. ) is showing that there is a preference for this technology by women farmers. Also, the clear economic value of the additional support for animal husbandry from cattle forage production provides an important economic driver for this push-pull system (Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, ). For Desmodium in the climate change-adapted push-pull system, there are clear and newly measured indications of carbon sequestration, prominent fixation of nitrogen and evidence of improved phosphorus availability in long-term studies on-farm (C. A. O. Midega, unpublished). This work also reports new, more highly drought-tolerant Desmodium species of African origin.

              
In terms of plant volatile-mediated signalling, new discoveries from maize crop plants offer further opportunities in agriculture. Smallholder cereal farmers benefiting from the push-pull system do not normally buy seasonal inputs of fertilizers, pesticides or seed. Although they, as a consequence, do not benefit from maize hybrid vigour, their self-saved seed, that is, seed from open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) such as Nymula and Jowi in western Kenya and the land races from which they have been locally adapted, show a signalling response directly to egg-laying by lepitopterous stemborers. Thus, the land race Cuba 91, and Nyamala and Jowi, bearing eggs laid by C. partellus, release volatile signals that recruit foraging by both egg parasitoids, for example Trichogramma bournieri, and larval parasitoids, for example C. sesamiae (Tamiru et al., , ). This trait can be traced back to the maize ancestors, the teosintes (Mutyambai et al., ). This 'smart' trait is absent from most of the regionally commercially available, but unaffordable, hybrids. It is therefore now being investigated, both for exploitation in local breeding programmes and also, potentially, to sell, via IP protection in the interests of farmers from sub-Saharan Africa, to hybrid maize breeders in the North for invigoration of resistance to pests, and for insect control beyond Bt insect-resistant crops.

              
The companion crops, being largely unimproved genetically, show associated highly prominent signalling properties. For example, the intercrop M. minutiflora releases signals that induce indirect secondary defence signalling in the appropriate varieties of neighbouring maize plants. When one of the first used drought-tolerant species of perimeter (trap) crops (i.e. the equivalent of the 'pull' plants in the original push-pull system), Brachiaria brizantha (which comprises one of the parents of Brachiaria Mulato II), is exposed to eggs of C. partellus, the emission of the normally major volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate was substantially reduced, while release of certain minor components increased. These changes served to reduce herbivory but increased foraging by the parasitoid C. sesamia (Bruce et al., ). Brachiaria brizantha was also found, when exposed to the pest C. partellus, to signal to the OPVs Nymula and Jowi, and the land race Cuba 91, causing these plants to release volatile attractant signals, including the tetranorterpenes DMNT and TMTT, for the parasitoid C. sesamia. There is, in such experiments, always the possibility that, rather than a signal from a damaged or otherwise stressed plant being received and causing secondary signalling, the original signal volatiles from the damaged plant could be absorbed and then re-emitted. However, neither of two physically similar hybrid maize varieties, Western Seed Hybrid 505 and Powani hybrid, produced the secondary defence signalling observed for the nonhybrids. These studies were facilitated by placing damaged plants and controls upwind of intact receiver plants on the bank of Lake Victoria at Mbita Point (International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE)), Kenya, so that the regular afternoon onshore breeze would take the plant-plant signal volatiles to the recipient plants (Magara et al., ) (Fig. ). Further work on proof of the signal response in such recipient plants is in progress. However, the use of inactive recipient hybrid varieties as controls seems to provide conclusive results and could be used in overcoming, more widely, the challenge of determining causal effects in signalling systems.

              
The value of wild grasses noted in the cis-jasmone work is recommended for further investigation. Indeed, we originally surveyed sub-Saharan African wild grass diversity for traits from which we obtained the original push-pull companion crops (Khan et al., ). We now propose to make a similar survey, but by searching for wild plants particularly effective at signalling, and in terms of both receiving and responding to such signals. It may be possible to enlist amateur or citizen botanists for this purpose and, in sub-Saharan Africa, local interest in village-based herbal cures, particularly among women, could be enlisted for this purpose, which would in turn be of advantage to local agriculture. This would be facilitated by the climate-adapted push-pull already being taken up by the thousands of farmsteads showing further gender bias towards women.

VIII. Exploitation of plant volatile-mediated signalling in agriculture by GM

              
Understanding the process of volatile-mediated defence signalling can facilitate breeding programmes, not only using marker-assisted molecular breeding, but also by identifying the functional, as well as regulatory, genes for biosynthesis of the signals. Where these signals are secondary metabolites, or are related to them, GM is an obvious and more direct route. Initially, the biosynthesis of insect pheromones led the field in terms of biosynthesis genes, and plants have been transformed to do this principally for production purposes. However, the wide range of identified attractant pheromones, for example lepidopterous sex pheromones (Ding et al., , ), offers considerable opportunities for development of trap or 'pull' companion plants.

              
Alarm pheromones potentially offer opportunities for negatively affecting pest colonization and, in the 1980s, we suggested such a role for the aphid alarm pheromone if released from crop plants by GM technologies (Gibson & Pickett, ; Pickett, ). By 2006, we had demonstrated the principle of this in A. thaliana against the aphid Myzus persicae, and also for increased foraging behaviour by the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae (Beale et al., ) which, together with M. persicae, is adapted to brassicaceous plant systems. In wheat, we then expressed, as synthetic genes, the synthase genes for production of the precursor farnesyl diphosphate and the pheromone (E)-[beta]-farnesene, together with amino acid sequences for plastidial targeting. This was accomplished in 2012 in the contemporary elite wheat variety Cadenza and, with the single and double constructs, gave excellent repellency of cereal aphids and increased foraging by A. ervi in the laboratory. However, two spring sowings and a winter sowing, over 2012/2013, showed no evidence of aphid control or increased parasitism in the field (Bruce et al., ). The genetic engineering was highly successful, but constitutive expression may not be appropriate for a pheromone produced naturally as a short burst when aphids are attacked. We are therefore investigating new approaches to expression of the synthase genes, and thereby release of the pheromone in a manner more similar to that by aphids, by using plant defence elicitation, for example cis-jasmone signalling and aphid feeding-associated induced effects. For the latter, a specific farnesyl diphosphate synthetic gene in wheat has been identified that is very rapidly up-regulated on aphid feeding (Zhang et al., ), and the promoter sequence for this gene is being investigated as a means of exploiting release of (E)-[beta]-farnesene initiated by aphid feeding. The low levels of aphids and their parasitoids were also considered to be a problem in the field trials, so high parasitoid ecosystems will be targeted for future experiments.

              
It may be that pheromones derived from insects present wider problems for exploitation in crop plants by GM, and therefore stress-related plant volatile-mediated signalling is being targeted. Thus, as the value of tetranorterpenes has been clearly demonstrated in agriculture by companion cropping approaches (see Section VII), these now provide specific targets for new GM crops (Bruce et al., ; Lee et al., ; Matthes et al., , ). The synthetic biological approach embodied in Fig.  would also provide novel synthetic genes for producing improved analogues.

              
In delivering approaches to exploiting plant volatile-mediated signalling by GM, insect-derived elicitors of plant defence signalling will also be crucial (see Section IV). Egg-associated elicitors would be particularly valuable (Hilker & Meiners, ), because such materials require little or no leaf tissue damage (Hinton, ) and so could be applied externally to crop plants. Although morphological studies on eggs of C. partellus have been reported, no indication of the induction of secondary defence was revealed (Deep & Rose, ). However, egg elicitors for C. partellus have now been tentatively identified and synthetic material is under bioassay in Kenya at Mbita Point (ICIPE). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of plants, and particularly RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for investigating the signal generation and recognition, for example, of the egg-elicited process in plants, offer new and generic opportunities for identification of these elicitors.

              
The value of NGS-based associative transcriptomics of traits is recognized as a valuable tool (Harper et al., ) but, with the use of defence elicitors to create specific differences in the transcriptome, RNA-Seq quickly picks up the candidate genes for defence. The promoter sequences for defence genes, such as those for biosynthesis of plant volatile-mediated signalling, will also be valuable in switching on defence genes in GM plants, particularly as this switching can be readily linked to pest presence rather than being constitutively expressed, as are current GM insect resistance genes. Possibly, further engineering of induced or primed signalling gene expression could be effected by highly targeted gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 which, together with the associated gene drive, are proving in the laboratory to be extremely powerful tools with haematophagous insects (Gantz et al., ) and, more recently, with phytophagous insects in relation to plant volatile signalling (Koutroumpa et al., ).

              
Whether exploitation of plant volatile-mediated signalling is by GM or other means, a question always raised is: what of resistance by the pest or beneficial organism? The answer must always be that, where signals are deployed to the disadvantage of an organism, that is, protecting a valuable food source from herbivory or offering false signals to beneficial insects looking for prey, then resistance will develop. Indeed, there must be a large element of falseness in exploiting biological control by plant volatile-mediated signalling, and recently a strong argument has been made for offering extra-floral nectar to mitigate the falseness of signalling, including to parasitoids and predators (Stenberg et al., ). For natural plant signals, we would need only to identify a new, naturally occurring signal. This is unlike the situation with pesticides where an entirely new toxophore would have to be developed, with a new mode of action to overcome resistance by target site modification, or a new type of chemical structure to deal with metabolic resistance. Without dramatic evolutionary changes, requiring at least speciation, the organisms developing resistance would need a signal with a new molecular structure but having the same evolutionary role.

              
Thus, we have a largely unappreciated but rational way by which to overcome resistance and to identify these new signals. The approach is the same as for the original signal and is by bioassay-guided fractionation. Electrophysiology coupled with gas chromatography, applied to the insects developing resistance, quickly points to new signal compounds, which are then identified with chemical analytical spectroscopy in conjunction with chemical synthesis. The plant genes to be used in the new resistance-defeating GM plants would follow the route also followed for identifying those for the original signal, and the compounds would be closely related. Although this may be considered to be optimistically speculative, evidence from animal signalling via pheromones shows that, under evolutionary pressure or merely species isolation, the biosynthesis and receptor molecular recognition systems change in synchrony during the selection process (Niehuis et al., ; Unbehend et al., ; Martin et al., ). Already, we can see the mechanism by which new pheromonal components can be generated during evolution (Bucek et al., ; Ding et al., ). Nonetheless, this process of overcoming resistance should be preserved for essential use by deployment of the plant-derived signals in integrated systems such as push-pull, and not using GM as the sole pest management tool.

IX. Conclusions

              
Considerable advances have been made in the engineering of plant secondary metabolism in crop plants by GM. Although this approach has only recently been applied to metabolites comprising plant volatile-mediated signals, already, by more conventional technologies, evidence has been provided that these agents show promise for the future in crop protection. Eventually, many aspects of plant volatile-mediated signalling may be delivered, without seasonal treatment, by sentinel plants which are problem-sensitive and which, after experiencing a threat or even an opportunity, signal to the main perennial crops. These then mount a response which could be enhanced by GM (Birkett & Pickett, ). This also presents a novel opportunity to increase the value of plants offering ecosystem services, as suggested in Fig. , as a way forward, beyond the sentinel concept expressed previously (Birkett & Pickett, ; Pickett, ).

Summary

              
The mediation of volatile secondary metabolites in signalling between plants and other organisms has long been seen as presenting opportunities for sustainable crop protection. Initially, exploitation of interactions between plants and other organisms, particularly insect pests, foundered because of difficulties in delivering, sustainably, the signal systems for crop protection. We now have mounting and, in some cases, clear practical evidence for successful delivery by companion cropping or next-generation genetic modification (GM). At the same time, the type of plant signalling being exploited has expanded to signalling from plants to organisms antagonistic to pests, and to plant stress-induced, or primed, plant-to-plant signalling for defence and growth stimulation.

T1  - Conserving long unburnt vegetation is important for bird species, guilds and diversity
AN  - 1835917030
AB  - Landscape-level wildfires have a major role in structuring faunal assemblages, particularly in fire-prone landscapes. These effects are mediated by changes to vegetation structure and composition that directly influence the availability of shelter, feeding and breeding resources. We investigated the response of a semi-arid shrubland bird community in Western Australia to the prevailing fire regime by examining the abundance, diversity and guild structure in relation to time since fire. We also examined vegetation structural attributes in relation to time since fire. We surveyed 32 sites ranging in age from 12 to 84 years since last fire. A total of 845 birds from 40 species were recorded. Vegetation structure varied with fire history with old and very old sites characterised by less bare ground, more leaf litter cover and greater canopy cover. Bird community composition varied with time since fire, driven by increased bird species richness and abundance of insectivores, granivores/frugivores, golden whistlers, grey shrike-thrush and red-capped robins with time since fire. Frequent, intense landscape-scale fires transform the landscape into homogeneous young shrublands, which may render vegetation unsuitable for several species and guilds.

T1  - Wildfire, climate, and invasive grass interactions negatively impact an indicator species by reshaping sagebrush ecosystems
AN  - 1840681044
AB  - Iconic sagebrush ecosystems of the American West are threatened by larger and more frequent wildfires that can kill sagebrush and facilitate invasion by annual grasses, creating a cycle that alters sagebrush ecosystem recovery post disturbance. Thwarting this accelerated grass-fire cycle is at the forefront of current national conservation efforts, yet its impacts on wildlife populations inhabiting these ecosystems have not been quantified rigorously. Within a Bayesian framework, we modeled 30 y of wildfire and climatic effects on population rates of change of a sagebrush-obligate species, the greater sage-grouse, across the Great Basin of western North America. Importantly, our modeling also accounted for variation in sagebrush recovery time post fire as determined by underlying soil properties that influence ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion. Our results demonstrate that the cumulative loss of sagebrush to direct and indirect effects of wildfire has contributed strongly to declining sage-grouse populations over the past 30 y at large spatial scales. Moreover, long-lasting effects from wildfire nullified pulses of sage-grouse population growth that typically follow years of higher precipitation. If wildfire trends continue unabated, model projections indicate sage-grouse populations will be reduced to 43% of their current numbers over the next three decades. Our results provide a timely example of how altered fire regimes are disrupting recovery of sagebrush ecosystems and leading to substantial declines of a widespread indicator species. Accordingly, we present scenario-based stochastic projections to inform conservation actions that may help offset the adverse effects of wildfire on sage-grouse and other wildlife populations.

T1  - Wildfire impacts on California spotted owl nesting habitat in the Sierra Nevada
AN  - 2313396154
AB  - California spotted owls (CSOs) (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) have received significant conservation attention beginning with the U.S. Forest Service interim management guidelines in 1992. The most commonly reported forest habitat feature for successful nesting habitat of CSO is canopy cover > 70%. Loss and degradation of Sierra Nevada CSO habitat, however, has been a growing concern, initially from commercial tree harvesting and, more recently, from wildfire. This study examined trends in wildfire impacts on potential nesting habitat of the CSO and discusses different management approaches that might lead to the conservation of CSO in fire‐dependent forests. A total of 85,046 ha of CSO potential nesting habitat was burned by fire that resulted in ≥ 50% tree basal area (BA) mortality, reducing canopy cover on average to < 25%, during 2000–2014; this included 2.7%, 12.3%, and 7.6% of dense red fir (Abies magnifica), eastside pine, and westside forests, respectively. Based on regression predictions, within the next 75 yr, the cumulative amount of nesting habitat burned at ≥ 50% tree basal area mortality will exceed the total existing habitat. Four management strategies are discussed that could enhance the conservation of the CSO: (1) increased fire suppression, (2) strategically reducing fire hazards using mechanical treatments and/or prescribed fire, (3) increasing the amount of managed wildfire in CSO habitat, and (4) developing a landscape strategy that uses historical forest structure information to identify areas where high‐canopy cover forests are more sustainable. Our estimates of how moderate‐ and high‐severity fire may affect forests into the future poise a substantial threat to CSO persistence. More comprehensive forest restoration activities may be needed in CSO habitat to avoid significant losses of older forests.

T1  - Transferability of habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers associated with wildfire/Habilidad de transferencia de los modelos de idoneidad de hábitat de pájaros carpinteros anidantes asociados con fuegos naturales
AN  - 1850355746
AB  - Following wildfire, forest managers are challenged with meeting both socioeconomic demands (e.g., salvage logging) and mandates requiring habitat conservation for disturbance-associated wildlife (e.g., woodpeckers). Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat suitability models and tested their transferability for 2 disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate ("application") locations. Models generally discriminated nest from non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations.

T1  - The relative importance of tree and stand properties in susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreak in the mid‐20th century
AN  - 2290145084
AB  - Tree susceptibility to potentially lethal agents is determined not only by attributes of individual trees, but also by neighborhood effects at a range of scales. For example, effects of disturbances on individual trees are often contingent on the size, configuration, and other properties of neighboring trees. Wildfires can modify postfire properties of individual trees as well as of entire forest stands, both of which can affect subsequent ecological processes, including subsequent disturbances. In recent years, much has been learned about how disturbances interact, but numerous questions concerning underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. For example, the relative importance of forest properties at different spatial scales in determining how fires affect forest susceptibility to subsequent disturbances is not well understood. This study explicitly compares the relative importance of tree vs. fine‐scale neighborhood effects (e.g., stand properties at <7 m radii), on susceptibility to a 1940s' spruce beetle outbreak. Attributes of individual trees and of stand structure were spatially reconstructed at five 250‐m2 sites that were partly burned in the late 19th century and then affected by spruce beetle outbreak in the 1940s. Random Forest models and classification trees were used to compare the relative importance of variables for susceptibility to spruce beetle attack. Individual tree properties (diameter at breast height and age) were the most important predictors of susceptibility to the outbreak across all sites combined and at each of the sites individually. In contrast, neighborhood effects were poor predictors of susceptibility. This study suggests wildfires reduce susceptibility to outbreaks primarily by reducing the size of postfire live trees and only secondarily by modifying stand structure. One implication of this is that management strategies that aim to modify stand structure over large areas in order to reduce susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreaks may be unnecessarily intensive.

T1  - Prescribed fire and conifer removal promote positive understorey vegetation responses in oak woodlands
AN  - 2061783136
AB  - Fire‐prone woodlands and savannas world‐wide face management challenges resulting from fire exclusion and subsequent encroachment of fire‐sensitive trees. In the Pacific Northwest (USA), Quercus garryana oak woodlands and savannas are threatened by encroachment from the native conifer Pseudotsuga menziesii in the absence of fire.In the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park (California, USA), prescribed fire and conifer removal have been used to restore encroached woodlands. We examined the effects of encroachment and restoration on understorey vegetation, comparing four treatments: prescribed fire, prescribed fire and conifer removal, conifer removal, and encroached (control).Treatments including prescribed fire had the greatest native species richness. These two treatments also had the greatest non‐native species richness, at both the site level and the treatment level. Woodlands treated with conifer removal and no prescribed fire were intermediate in species richness and diversity compared to burned treatments and encroached woodlands. Encroached woodlands had diminished richness and diversity compared to all restoration treatments. Non‐metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination demonstrated that conifer basal area, conifer litter and fine wood were associated with low species richness and diversity and that elevation and thatch were associated with higher species richness and diversity. Indicator species analysis identified that most native species and non‐native species were associated with burned woodlands that were never encroached.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both prescribed fire and conifer removal have benefits for understorey plant communities, increasing species richness, diversity and cover in oak woodlands and shifting understorey communities from forest‐associated species to more woodland‐associated species. Restoration of remnant Quercus garryana oak woodlands is complicated by the persistence and abundance of non‐native herbaceous plants.

T1  - A systematic conservation planning approach to fire risk management in Natura 2000 sites
AN  - 1835030912; 4760944
AB  - A primary challenge in conservation biology is to preserve the most representative biodiversity while simultaneously optimizing the efforts associated with conservation. In Europe, the implementation of the Natura 2000 network requires protocols to recognize and map threats to biodiversity and to identify specific mitigation actions. We propose a systematic conservation planning approach to optimize management actions against specific threats based on two fundamental parameters: biodiversity values and threat pressure. We used the conservation planning software Marxan to optimize a fire management plan in a Natura 2000 coastal network in southern Italy. We address three primary questions: i) Which areas are at high fire risk? ii) Which areas are the most valuable for threatened biodiversity? iii) Which areas should receive priority risk-mitigation actions for the optimal effect?, iv) which fire-prevention actions are feasible in the management areas?. The biodiversity values for the Natura 2000 spatial units were derived from the distribution maps of 18 habitats and 89 vertebrate species of concern in Europe (Habitat Directive 92/43/EEC). The threat pressure map, defined as fire probability, was obtained from digital layers of fire risk and of fire frequency. Marxan settings were defined as follows: a) planning units of 40 x 40 m, b) conservation features defined as all habitats and vertebrate species of European concern occurring in the study area, c) conservation targets defined according with fire sensitivity and extinction risk of conservation features, and d) costs determined as the complement of fire probabilities. We identified 23 management areas in which to concentrate efforts for the optimal reduction of fire-induced effects. Because traditional fire prevention is not feasible for most of policy habitats included in the management areas, alternative prevention practices were identified that allows the conservation of the vegetation structure. The proposed approach has potential applications for multiple landscapes, threats and spatial scales and could be extended to other valuable natural areas, including protected areas.

T1  - Drivers of Bird Species Richness within Moist High-Altitude Grasslands in Eastern South Africa
AN  - 1826188919
AB  - Moist high-altitude grasslands in South Africa are renowned for high avifaunal diversity and are priority areas for conservation. Conservation management of these areas conflicts with management for other uses, such as intensive livestock agriculture, which requires annual burning and leads to heavy grazing. Recently the area has become target for water storage schemes and renewable electricity energy projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in the eastern South African high-altitude grasslands. An area that had been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models, to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only. Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years. Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to accommodates birds of various habitat needs.

T1  - Prescribed fire and conifer removal promote positive understorey vegetation responses in oak woodlands
AN  - 1819116866
AB  - Summary

              
Fire-prone woodlands and savannas world-wide face management challenges resulting from fire exclusion and subsequent encroachment of fire-sensitive trees. In the Pacific Northwest (USA), Quercus garryana oak woodlands and savannas are threatened by encroachment from the native conifer Pseudotsuga menziesii in the absence of fire.

              
In the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park (California, USA), prescribed fire and conifer removal have been used to restore encroached woodlands. We examined the effects of encroachment and restoration on understorey vegetation, comparing four treatments: prescribed fire, prescribed fire and conifer removal, conifer removal, and encroached (control).

              
Treatments including prescribed fire had the greatest native species richness. These two treatments also had the greatest non-native species richness, at both the site level and the treatment level. Woodlands treated with conifer removal and no prescribed fire were intermediate in species richness and diversity compared to burned treatments and encroached woodlands. Encroached woodlands had diminished richness and diversity compared to all restoration treatments. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination demonstrated that conifer basal area, conifer litter and fine wood were associated with low species richness and diversity and that elevation and thatch were associated with higher species richness and diversity. Indicator species analysis identified that most native species and non-native species were associated with burned woodlands that were never encroached.

              
Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that both prescribed fire and conifer removal have benefits for understorey plant communities, increasing species richness, diversity and cover in oak woodlands and shifting understorey communities from forest-associated species to more woodland-associated species. Restoration of remnant Quercus garryana oak woodlands is complicated by the persistence and abundance of non-native herbaceous plants.

T1  - Spatial and temporal synchrony in reptile population dynamics in variable environments
AN  - 1819074897
AB  - Resources are seldom distributed equally across space, but many species exhibit spatially synchronous population dynamics. Such synchrony suggests the operation of large-scale external drivers, such as rainfall or wildfire, or the influence of oasis sites that provide water, shelter, or other resources. However, testing the generality of these factors is not easy, especially in variable environments. Using a long-term dataset (13-22 years) from a large (8000 km
2) study region in arid Central Australia, we tested firstly for regional synchrony in annual rainfall and the dynamics of six reptile species across nine widely separated sites. For species that showed synchronous spatial dynamics, we then used multivariate follow a multivariate auto-regressive state-space (MARSS) models to predict that regional rainfall would be positively associated with their populations. For asynchronous species, we used MARSS models to explore four other possible population structures: (1) populations were asynchronous, (2) differed between oasis and non-oasis sites, (3) differed between burnt and unburnt sites, or (4) differed between three sub-regions with different rainfall gradients. Only one species showed evidence of spatial population synchrony and our results provide little evidence that rainfall synchronizes reptile populations. The oasis or the wildfire hypotheses were the best-fitting models for the other five species. Thus, our six study species appear generally to be structured in space into one or two populations across the study region. Our findings suggest that for arid-dwelling reptile populations, spatial and temporal dynamics are structured by abiotic events, but individual responses to covariates at smaller spatial scales are complex and poorly understood.

T1  - Rainfall and topography predict gene flow among populations of the declining northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus)
AN  - 1815928258
AB  - Landscape attributes often shape the spatial genetic structure of species. As the maintenance of genetic connectivity is increasingly a conservation priority, the identification of landscape features that influence connectivity can inform targeted management strategies. The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) is a carnivorous marsupial that has experienced dramatic population declines in recent decades. To inform management of surviving D. hallucatus populations across north-western Australia we examined the genetic structure of populations, and identified landscape features that influence gene flow within the Kimberley region. We sampled 249 individuals from 28 populations in three regions of north-western Australia, including the Kimberley, Pilbara and Kakadu. Genetic structuring was evident between the three regions and to a lesser extent between the north and central Kimberley. Landscape genetic analysis of Kimberley populations suggest this structuring may be due in part to the indirect effects of differences in rainfall between these two areas. Also, D. hallucatus populations with large areas of open habitat between them tended to be more genetically similar. Managing threats such as the occurrence of intense and frequent fires, and the density of introduced herbivores, could support the persistence of D. hallucatus populations, particularly in areas with high rainfall and flat terrain, where greater genetic connectivity confers a better chance of long-term population survival.

T1  - Gondwanan conifer clones imperilled by bushfire
AN  - 1899094057
AB  - Global increases in fire frequency driven by anthropogenic greenhouse emissions and land use change could threaten unique and ancient species by creeping into long-term fire refugia. The perhumid and mountainous western half of Tasmania is a globally important refugium for palaeo-endemic, fire intolerant lineages, especially conifers. Reproductive strategy will be crucial to the resilience of these organisms under warmer, dryer and more fire prone climates. This study analysed clonal versus sexual reproduction in old growth plots dominated by the palaeo-endemic conifer Athrotaxis cupressoides (Cupressaceae), a species that lacks any traits to tolerate frequent landscape fire. Across most of the seven plots the amount of sexually derived individuals was lower than clonally derived with, on average, 60% of all stems belonging to the same multi-locus lineage (MLL) (i.e. were clonal). Some MLLs were large spanning over 10 s of metres and consisted of up to 62 stems. The high mortality after fire and the rarity of sexual regeneration means that the range of this fire-intolerant species is likely to contract under enhanced fire regimes and has a limited capacity to disperse via seed to available fire refugia in the landscape.

T1  - Fire, Invertebrate Damage, and Reproductive Output in the Endemic Forb Liatris ohlingerae (Asteraceae)
AN  - 1822613430
AB  - In pyrogenic ecosystems, fire often plays an integral part in plant population dynamics. For a subset of plant species in such ecosystems, fire is connected to seed set and/or germination, resulting in postfire recruitment episodes. We investigated the relationship between fire and seed set in the perennial forb Liatris ohlingerae (Asteraceae), one of many species endemic to the pyrogenic Lake Wales Ridge ecosystem of central Florida. Our study focused on comparisons of seed production and invertebrate damage to flowers across L. ohlingerae populations in locations encompassing a range of intervals since fire, between 1 mo and 9 yr prior to the study. We found that the estimated seed set was significantly higher in populations burned less than 1 yr prior to the study than in all other populations. Both low invertebrate damage and high seed production rates contributed to this trend in the populations burned < 1 yr prior to the study. Previous research has demonstrated that germination of L. ohlingerae seeds is higher and seed predation is lower in more recently burned patches, so it is likely that the pulse of seed production observed in recently burned populations would carry through to the seedling stage. The processes behind the observed increase in fecundity remain unknown, and their characterization will likely be valuable for continued efforts to conserve L. ohlingerae. Because invertebrate damage did not significantly influence seed production, it need not be prioritized for conservation management.

T1  - Effect of nest location on gopher tortoise nest survival
AN  - 1814687808
AB  - Gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) populations are declining range-wide primarily because of habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, but low recruitment due to nest predation also may be contributing to this decline. The relationship of nest location and nest survival is unknown. Therefore, our objective was to determine whether nest location influenced depredation risk and potential recruitment success. Between 30 May 2013 and 3 September 2014, we constructed and monitored 105 artificial gopher tortoise nests (45 in 2013 and 60 in 2014) with 35 nests at each of 3 classifications of nest sites: within active burrow aprons (i.e., the mound of sand at the burrow entrance), inactive burrow aprons, and open sandy sites. Using the artificial nests, we investigated the influence of nest site classification, distance to road, and prescribed fire frequency (<1 year and 1 year since burn) on gopher tortoise nest survival. Additionally, we monitored 21 natural nests at burrow aprons to assess predation patterns as compared to artificial nests. Seventy-two (57%) of 126 nests were fully depredated during the study, and predation rates at artificial and natural nests were similar. We identified predators at 48 nests using trail cameras; the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) was the primary nest predator (69%). Nests in open sandy areas away from burrows exhibited greater daily survival rates (DSR; 0.991±0.005 SE) compared to nests in burrow aprons (active burrow aprons: 0.967±0.018; inactive burrow aprons: 0.949±0.027). Additionally, nests at locations burned the year of the study had a lower chance of survival (DSR: 0.959±0.022) than nests at locations burned the previous year (DSR: 0.991±0.005). Management practices that maintain open sandy areas (e.g., prescribed fire) away from burrows may increase tortoise nest survival. Fire return intervals of >1 year that are implemented frequently enough to maintain open sandy areas would be beneficial to nesting tortoises. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Habitat selection of wild turkeys in burned longleaf pine savannas
AN  - 1814123573
AB  - Frequent prescribed fire (≤3 yr) and selective harvest of off-site hardwoods are the primary restoration and management tools for pine (Pinus spp.) savannas in the southeastern United States. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) habitat selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management decisions. Therefore, we investigated habitat selection of female turkeys in 2 longleaf pine savanna systems managed by frequent fire in southwestern Georgia during 2011-2013. We observed differential habitat selection across 2 scales (study area and seasonal area of use) and 3 seasons (fall-winter: 1 Oct-30 Jan; pre-breeding: 1 Feb-19 Apr; and summer: 16 Jun-30 Sep). During fall-winter, turkeys selected mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, and young pine stands, albeit at different scales. During pre-breeding, turkeys selected for mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and shrub-scrub, although at different scales. During summer, turkeys also demonstrated scale-specific selection but generally selected for mature pine, hardwoods, and shrub-scrub. Days-since-fire did not influence selection of stands managed by frequent fire (≤3 yr). In cases where female turkeys used pine-dominated stands (i.e., mature pine, young pine, and mixed pine-hardwoods), selection was not influenced by days-since-fire; however, these results are at least partially due to a lack of longer burn rotations (>3 yr) on our study areas. We suggest land managers consider scale of selection by turkeys when developing habitat management strategies. In addition to creating early successional habitat conditions by using prescribed fire, we recommend managers retain hardwoods and recognize the importance of shrub-scrub cover to management of turkey populations in longleaf pine savannas. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Fire Effects on Wildlife in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian Regions, USA
AN  - 2409021285
AB  - Fire is being prescribed and used increasingly to promote ecosystem restoration (e.g., oak woodlands and savannas) and to manage wildlife habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachian regions, USA. However, questions persist as to how fire affects hardwood forest communities and associated wildlife, and how fire should be used to achieve management goals. We provide an up-to-date review of fire effects on various wildlife species and their habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians. Documented direct effects (i.e., mortality) on wildlife are rare. Indirect effects (i.e., changes in habitat quality) are influenced greatly by light availability, fire frequency, and fire intensity. Unless fire intensity is great enough to kill a portion of the overstory, burning in closed-canopy forests has provided little benefit for most wildlife species in the region because it doesn’t result in enough sunlight penetration to elicit understory response. Canopy reduction through silvicultural treatment has enabled managers to use fire more effectively. Fire intensity must be kept low in hardwoods to limit damage to many species of overstory trees. However, wounding or killing trees with fire benefits many wildlife species by allowing increased sunlight to stimulate understory response, snag and subsequent cavity creation, and additions of large coarse woody debris. In general, a fire-return interval of 2 yr to 7 yr benefits a wide variety of wildlife species by providing a diverse structure in the understory; increasing browse, forage, and soft mast; and creating snags and cavities. Historically, dormant-season fire was most prevalent in these regions, and it still is when most prescribed fire is implemented in hardwood systems as burn-days are relatively few in the growing season of May through August because of shading from leaf cover and high fuel moisture. Late growing-season burning increases the window for burning, and better control on woody composition is possible. Early growing-season fire may pose increased risk for some species, especially herpetofauna recently emerged from winter hibernacula (April) or forest songbirds that nest in the understory (May to June). However, negative population-level effects are unlikely unless the burned area is relatively large and early growing-season fire is used continually. We did not find evidence that fire is leading to population declines for any species, including Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species (e.g., Indiana bat [Myotis sodalis Mill. Allen] or northern long-eared bat [M. septentrionalis Trouess.]). Instead, data indicate that fire can enhance habitat for bats by increasing suitability of foraging and day-roost sites. Similarly, concern over burning and displacement of woodland salamanders (Plethodontidae), another taxa of heightened conservation concern, is alleviated when fire is prescribed along ecologically appropriate aspect and slope gradients and not forced into mesic, high site index environments where salamanders are most common. Because topography across the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians is diverse, we contend that applying fire on positions best suited for burning is an effective approach to increase regional landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity. Herein, we offer prescriptive concepts for burning for various wildlife species and guilds in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians.

T1  - Natural Canopy Damage and the Ecological Restoration of Fire-Indicative Groundcover Vegetation in an Oak-Pine Forest
AN  - 2409020301
AB  - An important goal of restoring fire to upland oak-dominated communities that have experienced fire exclusion is restoring groundcover plant species diversity and composition indicative of fire-maintained habitats. Several studies have shown that fire alone, however, may not be sufficient to accomplish this goal. Furthermore, treatment-driven declines in rare forest specialists could negate the benefits of ecological restoration in these ecosystems. I present the results of an experiment examining effects of tornado-generated canopy openings and biennial spring burning on groundcover vegetation at an oak-pine forest in north Mississippi, USA. Results from four years of monitoring showed that species richness and abundance of species indicative of fire-maintained open habitats were greater at sites with canopy damage than at sites with undamaged canopies, especially in years without drought. Annual ruderals increased initially following canopy damage but then decreased. Few forest indicator species changed in abundance, and the few that did increased. Canopy openings appeared to have a greater effect than fire on groundcover vegetation, although some legumes and panicgrasses appeared to benefit directly from fire. Results suggest that fire restoration treatments must include both canopy openings and fire to effectively increase the diversity and distinctiveness of groundcover vegetation in mixed oak-pine forests. Prescribed burning after years of fire exclusion, by itself, does not constitute effective restoration of fire (at least in the short term), but it also does not appear to reduce the abundance of rare, forest-specialist groundcover species.

T1  - Hardwood-Pine Mixedwoods Stand Dynamics following Thinning and Prescribed Burning
AN  - 2409020024
AB  - Restoration of hardwood-pine (Pinus L.) mixedwoods is an important management goal in many pine plantations in the southern Cumberland Plateau in north-central Alabama, USA. Pine plantations have been relatively unmanaged since initiation, and thus include a diversity of hardwoods developing in the understory. These unmanaged pine plantations have become increasingly vulnerable to insects, and management activities were initiated to facilitate transition towards hardwood-pine mixedwoods. We evaluated a combination of thinning and prescribed fire prescriptions in a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial treatment arrangement and four replications of each treatment. Treatments were combinations of thinning to three residual basal areas (no thin, light thin to 17.2 m2 ha−1, heavy thin to 11.5 m2 ha−1) and three prescribed burn applications (no burn, one burn to be repeated every 9 years, three burns repeated every 3 years). Burning without thinning altered stand structure by reducing overstory stem density by 15%, whereas thinning without burning reduced density by 70% and burning coupled with thinning resulted in reduced overstory trees by 72%. Frequent fire had the greatest impact on midstory structure and regeneration. Midstory stem density was reduced by 90% following thinning and burning. Oaks (Quercus L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.) were the most common understory species after thinning only, burning only, and thinning combined with burning. There were more oak and red maple seedling sprouts following frequent burning. Currently, >75% of red maple sprouts dominate the regeneration, compared to only 40% of the oaks. Although the treatments have accelerated the transition toward hardwood-pine mixedwoods, the fate of oak and which hardwood species will be dominant in the future remains uncertain.

T1  - Patch‐burn grazing increases habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity of small mammals in managed rangelands
AN  - 2290644792
AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is a key driver of biodiversity in many ecosystems. Wildlife inhabiting the native prairies of North America evolved in a heterogeneous mosaic of habitat conditions created by fire and grazing by native ungulates. Current rangeland management practices in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem evenly distribute fire and grazing across management units and promote homogeneous habitat conditions. Patch‐burn grazing is a rangeland management strategy that seeks to restore heterogeneity to rangelands via fire‐grazing interactions. Our 3.5‐year study tested the effects of patch‐burn grazing on habitat heterogeneity and small mammal community dynamics in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas. To study the ecological effects of patch‐burn grazing, we sampled habitat conditions and the small mammal community. We assessed habitat conditions once each growing season in a negative control that was annually burned and grazed, a positive control that was burned every four years and ungrazed, and within each of three units of a patch‐burn grazing experiment (PBG) managed with rotational fire. Habitat conditions were significantly different among treatments, and a principal components analysis showed that the patch‐burn grazing treatment had higher canopy cover of forbs and habitat heterogeneity than our two control units. To sample the small mammal community, we conducted monthly live trapping of small mammals on two randomly located trap grids in each of our two controls and three units of our PBG treatment. Small mammal diversity was significantly higher in the patch‐burn grazing treatment and in the positive control, vs. the negative control. Moreover, a canonical correspondence analysis showed that a fire‐grazing interaction was the major driver structuring small mammal communities. Patch‐burn grazing is an effective strategy for restoring heterogeneity to vegetative structure and composition, and can increase biodiversity of small mammals in managed rangelands in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem.

T1  - Effect of pyric herbivory on source-sink dynamics in grassland birds
AN  - 1803988326
AB  - Summary

              
Grasslands world-wide provide a host of ecosystem services. In particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds, which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing factor to these declines.

              
An alternative approach to this homogeneous management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and enhancing grassland bird populations.

              
We compared reproductive rates and estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. λ = 1) and source-sink population dynamics under the two management practices.

              
Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands.

              
Dickcissels and grasshopper sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source-sink dynamics of eastern meadowlarks.

              
Synthesis and applications. Management strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine source-sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices. However, land managers should consider that source-sink models have shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily mean the habitat has low conservation value.

T1  - Adapting the Fire-Grazing Interaction to Small Pastures in a Fragmented Landscape for Grassland Bird Conservation
AN  - 1802301515
AB  - In North America, the loss of habitat heterogeneity resulting from homogeneous livestock grazing is one factor contributing to steep population declines of many grassland bird species. Patch-burn grazing is a management technique that uses historic grassland disturbance as a model to create heterogeneous grassland composition and structure, providing for the diverse habitat requirements of grassland birds. Though this management technique has been used successfully in relatively extensive grasslands, its utility on smaller grassland patches is less clear. We examined the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity in relatively small pastures (15-32ha) in a grassland landscape fragmented by cultivation and tree encroachment. In 2006, we established 12 experimental pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of southern Iowa and northern Missouri, with 4 pastures in each of three treatments: 1) patch-burn graze, with spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle (the fire-grazing interaction), 2) graze-and-burn, with free access by cattle and a single burn of the entire pasture every third year, and 3) burn-only, with a single burn of the entire pasture every third year and no grazing. Patch-burn grazing in the first phase of the project (2007-2009) did not generate habitat heterogeneity or significant differences in bird diversity. From 2010 to 2013, stocking rates were reduced to increase residual vegetation in unburned patches at the end of the grazing season to increase heterogeneity. Habitat heterogeneity in patch-burn graze pastures subsequently increased relative to other treatments. Concomitantly, diversity of obligate grassland birds also increased in patch-burn graze pastures and was greatest in 2012 and 2013. We conclude that the fire-grazing interaction can be used to restore habitat heterogeneity and increase grassland bird diversity, even in relatively small grassland patches embedded in a highly fragmented landscape.

T1  - Restoration rocks: integrating abiotic and biotic habitat restoration to conserve threatened species and reduce fire fuel load
AN  - 1799427119
AB  - With rapid urban expansion, biodiversity conservation and human asset protection often require different regimes for managing wildfire risk. We conducted a controlled, replicated experiment to optimise habitat restoration for the threatened Australian pink-tailed worm-lizard, Aprasia parapulchella while reducing fire fuel load in a rapidly developing urban area. We used dense addition of natural rock (30 % cover) and native grass revegetation (Themeda triandra and Poa sieberiana) to restore critical habitat elements. Combinations of fire and herbicide (Glyphosate) were used to reduce fuel load and invasive exotic species. Rock restoration combined with herbicide application met the widest range of restoration goals: it reduced fire fuel load, increased ant occurrence (the primary prey of A. parapulchella) in the short-term and increased the growth and survival of native grasses. Lizards colonised the restored habitat within a year of treatment. Our study documents an innovative way by which conflicts between biodiversity conservation and human asset protection can be overcome.

T1  - Metapopulation analysis indicates native and non-native fishes respond differently to effects of wildfire on desert streams
AN  - 1794343999
AB  - Ash flows and flooding associated with wildfires represent important but understudied sources of disturbance for fish populations. Knowledge concerning these disturbances is especially limited for larger streams where warm water species dominate. Fire-related disturbances have been hypothesised to differentially affect native and non-native fishes, although this hypothesis has only been tested for salmonids. The objective of our research was to contrast effects of uncharacteristically large wildfires followed by flooding on metapopulations of native and non-native fishes in the Gila River of southwest New Mexico. Probabilities of occupancy, colonisation and local extinction of fishes were calculated across sites before and during disturbance and were also measured across a broader spatial scale during disturbance to identify potential refuge locations. Occupancy was higher for native fishes than non-natives, but multiple wildfire and flood events increased extinction probabilities of native species. Responses of non-native species to wildfires were mixed; extinction of non-native salmonids increased during disturbance, while extinction of several warm water species remained unchanged or decreased. Several undisturbed sites were poor refugia for natives as they were impacted by non-native piscivores, dewatering, and fragmentation. However, despite exposure to multiple disturbances, sites located in large tributary and valley reaches were consistently occupied by native species, suggesting these habitats provided refugia. We suggest that management actions (forest thinning; prescribed burning) that restore a more natural disturbance regime of small and less severe fires coupled with habitat remediation activities (non-native removal; decreased water withdrawal; improved connectivity) might diminish extinction risk for native fishes exposed to wildfire disturbance.

T1  - Occupancy and abundance of predator and prey: implications of the fire‐cheatgrass cycle in sagebrush ecosystems
AN  - 2313385565
AB  - Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystems are declining due to biological invasions and changes in fire regimes. Understanding how ecosystem changes influence functionally important animals such as ecosystem engineers is essential to conserve ecological functions. American badgers (Taxidea taxus) are an apex predator and ecosystem engineer in that they redistribute large amounts of soil within sagebrush ecosystems. Piute ground squirrels (Urocitellus mollis) are also an ecosystem engineer as well as an essential prey resource for many predators, including badgers. Our research objective was to evaluate the relative importance of biological invasions and fire, abiotic factors, and biotic factors on badgers and ground squirrels. We sampled 163 1‐ha plots during April‐June across a gradient of burn histories within a 1962 km2 study area in southern Idaho, USA. At each plot, we characterized occupancy of ground squirrels and badgers and relative abundance of ground squirrels. Additionally, we characterized soil texture, climate, connectivity and dispersal potential, fire frequency, grazing, and cover of many plant species including a highly invasive exotic annual grass (cheatgrass; Bromus tectorum). We used an integrated approach to evaluate competing hypotheses concerning factors influencing occupancy and abundance. Results suggested that occupancy of ground squirrels was positively associated with long‐term precipitation, dispersal potential, and fine‐grained soil. Abundance of ground squirrels was positively associated with fine‐grained soil, but negatively associated with cheatgrass, fire frequency, agriculture, and shrub cover. Badger occupancy was positively associated with ground squirrel occupancy and agriculture, which indicated affinity to prey. Our results provide insight into the relative influence of abiotic and biotic factors on predator and prey, and highlight how effects change across different population parameters. Our research suggests that widespread environmental change within sagebrush ecosystems, especially the fire‐cheatgrass cycle (e.g., invasion of cheatgrass and increased fire frequency) and human land disturbances, are directly and indirectly influencing ground squirrels and badgers. However, we also found evidence that efforts to mitigate these stressors, for example, establishing bunchgrasses postfire, may provide targeted conservation strategies that promote these species and thus preserve the burrowing and trophic functions they provide.

T1  - Contrasting responses of small mammals to fire and topographic refugia
AN  - 1904702574
AB  - Unburnt patches within burnt landscapes are expected to provide an important resource for fauna, potentially acting as a refuge from direct effects of fire and allowing animals to persist in burnt landscapes. Nevertheless, there is little information about the way refugia are used by fauna and how populations may be affected by them. Planned burns are often patchy, with unburnt areas generally associated with gully systems providing a good opportunity to study faunal use of refugia. We used a before-after control-impact design associated with a planned burn in south eastern Australia to investigate how two small mammal species, the bush rat Rattus fuscipes and agile antechinus Antechinus agilis, used unburnt gully systems within a larger burnt area. We tested three alternative hypotheses relating to post-fire abundance: (i) active refugia - abundance would increase in unburnt patches because of a post-fire shift of individuals from burnt to unburnt areas; (ii) passive refugia - abundance in unburnt patches would remain similar to pre-fire levels; and (iii) limited or no refugia - abundance would reduce in unburnt patches related to the change induced by fire in the wider landscape. We found the two species responded differently to the presence of unburnt refugia in the landscape. Relative to controls, fire had little effect on bush rat abundance in gullies, supporting hypothesis 2. In contrast, agile antechinus abundance increased in gullies immediately post-fire consistent with a shift of individuals from burnt parts of the landscape, supporting hypothesis 1. Differences in site fidelity, habitat use and intraspecific competition between these species are suggested as likely factors influencing responses to refugia. The way unburnt patches function as faunal refugia and the subsequent influence they have on post-fire population dynamics, will to some extent depend on the life history attributes of individual species.

T1  - WINTERING GRASSLAND BIRD RESPONSES TO VEGETATION STRUCTURE, EXOTIC INVASIVE PLANT COMPOSITION, AND DISTURBANCE REGIME IN COASTAL PRAIRIES OF TEXAS: A JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AN  - 1806425408
AB  - Many migratory grassland passerines complete their annual life cycle within the United States and investigations into wintering ecology of these species are scarce, particularly in ecoregions where habitat quality is considered to be compromised, such as the coastal prairie of Texas. During 2008-2010, we investigated wintering grassland bird ecology as related to coastal prairie composition and management practices on the mid-upper Texas coast. To quantify grassland bird composition and density among management regimes, we performed 260 transect surveys on 40 different study site pastures deployed among 7 different management regimes, varying in plant community composition as well as frequency (or occurrence) of burning, grazing, and mowing from 29 October 2008-7 April 2009 and 17 November 2009-17 March 2010. A total of 79 bird species (48 species in 2008-2009 and 66 species in 2009-2010) were recorded during this study. Sites that were recently (<2 years prior) grazed, burned, or mowed tended to have the greatest species richness of obligate grassland bird species. Management regime and the resulting habitat characteristics also appeared to influence densities of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), with the former two species selecting areas that had not been recently burned, grazed, or mowed and were characterized by greater vertical vegetation density and litter depth, respectively. Conversely, Sprague's Pipit selected recently burned, grazed, or mowed prairies, characterized by less litter depth and percentage of shrubs nearby. More cosmopolitan species, such as Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) occurred equally among management regimes. Despite similar species richness in floristically disturbed sites, nonnative vegetation appeared to negatively influence species with specific habitat requirements such as Sprague's Pipit, Sedge Wren, and Le Conte's Sparrow. In order to increase wintering avian diversity, coastal prairie habitat conservation and management in Texas should focus on restoring management regimes (i.e., burning, mowing, and grazing) that create heterogeneous environments, while maintaining native vegetation communities.

T1  - Regulation of seedling recruitment and survival in diverse ecotonal temperate forest understories
AN  - 1800618017
AB  - Issue Title: Fire Ecology

              
Fire is an important factor driving the position and stability of ecotones between fire-prone and less flammable forest types. To better understand, the recruitment processes that mediate plant persistence in ecotonal systems, we used manipulative field experiments in Australian wet eucalypt forests to investigate factors that may be regulating seedling recruitment and survival in burnt and unburnt forest. We found no evidence that safe sites from predators or exposure regulated seedling recruitment in three of the four study species, but one species associated with less flammable rainforest systems had increased germination rates in response to soil scarification. Seedlings of all four study species experienced higher rates of mortality resulting from herbivory or water stress in the post-fire environment. We found that intact ground cover increased seedling survival by reducing exposure to dessicating conditions and providing refuge from vertebrate herbivores. Our results suggest that shrubs associated with mesic, low-flammability forests have fewer opportunities for recruitment with desiccation risks in post-fire environments limiting seedling survival. In contrast, shrubs associated with high-flammability forests were capable of recruiting and surviving in both burnt and unburnt forests. Post-fire recruitment is likely to be more abundant after fire than at other times, but we found that survival can be highly constrained by post-fire herbivory. The ability of these species to recruit in undisturbed conditions provides some insurance against recruitment failure under stochastic variation in herbivory and desiccating conditions. The capacity to spread risks could be important in maintaining boundary position and diversity in these ecotonal systems.

T1  - Considering Spatial Scale and Reproductive Consequences of Habitat Selection when Managing Grasslands for a Threatened Species
AN  - 1798260421
AB  - Habitat selection that has fitness consequences has important implications for conservation activities. For example, habitat characteristics that influence nest success in birds can be manipulated to improve habitat quality with the goal of ultimately improving reproductive success. We examined habitat selection by the threatened streaked horned lark (Eremophila alpestris strigata) at both the breeding-site (territory) and nest-site scales. Larks were selective at both spatial scales but with contrasting selection. At the territory scale, male larks selected sparsely vegetated grasslands with relatively short vegetation. At the nest-site scale, female larks selected sites within territories with higher vegetation density and more perennial forbs. These nest-site scale choices had reproductive consequences, with greater nest success in areas with higher densities of perennial forbs. We experimentally manipulated lark habitat structure in an attempt to mimic the habitat conditions selected by larks by using late summer prescribed fires. After the burn, changes in vegetation structure were in the direction preferred by larks but habitat effects attenuated by the following year. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating habitat selection at spatial scales appropriate to the species of interest, especially when attempting to improve habitat quality for rare and declining species. They also highlight the importance of conducting restoration activities in a research context. For example, because the sparsely vegetated conditions created by fire attenuate, there may be value in examining more frequent burns or hotter fires as the next management and research action. We hope the design outlined in this study will serve as an integrated research and management example for conserving grassland birds generally.

T1  - Abundance and habitat relationships of breeding birds in the Sky Islands and adjacent Sierra Madre Occidental of northwest Mexico
AN  - 1794286158
AB  - The Sierra Madre Occidental and neighboring Madrean Sky Islands span a large and biologically diverse region of northwest Mexico and portions of the southwestern United States. Little is known about the abundance and habitat use of breeding birds in this region of Mexico, but such information is important for guiding conservation and management. We assessed densities and habitat relationships of breeding birds across Sky Island mountain ranges in Mexico and adjacent portions of the Sierra Madre from 2009 to 2012. We estimated densities at multiple spatial scales, assessed variation in densities among all major montane vegetation communities, and identified and estimated the effects of important habitat attributes on local densities. Regional density estimates of 65% of 72 focal species varied significantly among eight montane vegetation communities that ranged from oak savannah and woodland at low elevations to pine and mixed-conifer forest at high elevations. Greater proportions of species occurred at peak densities or were relatively restricted to mixed-conifer forest and montane riparian vegetation likely because of higher levels of structural or floristic diversity in those communities, but those species were typically rare or uncommon in the Sky Islands. Fewer species had peak densities in oak and pine-oak woodland, and species associated with those communities were often more abundant across the region. Habitat models often included the effects of broadleaf deciduous vegetation cover (30% of species), which, together with tree density and fire severity, had positive effects on densities and suggest ways for managers to augment and conserve populations. Such patterns combined with greater threats to high-elevation conifer forest and riparian areas underscore their value for conservation. Significant populations of many breeding bird species, including some that are of concern or were not known to occur regionally or in mountain ranges we surveyed, highlight the importance of conservation efforts in this area of Mexico.

              
Resumen

              
Abundancia y relaciones de hábitat de aves reproductivas en las Islas del Cielo y la contigua Sierra Madre Occidental del noroeste de México

              
La Sierra Madre Occidental y las vecinas Islas del Cielo Madrenses abarcan una extensa y biológicamente diversa región del noroeste de México y porciones del sudoeste de Estados Unidos. Poco se sabe sobre la abundancia y el uso de hábitat de las aves que crían en esta región de México, pero dicha información es importante para guiar la conservación y el manejo de la zona. Evaluamos densidades y relaciones de hábitat de aves reproductoras a lo largo de las cadenas montañosas de las Islas del Cielo en México y puntos adyacentes de la Sierra Madre desde el 2009 al 2012. Estimamos densidad a múltiples escalas, analizando la variación en la densidad entre las principales comunidades vegetales montanas, e identificamos y estimamos los efectos de importantes atributos de hábitat en las densidades locales. Estimaciones de densidad regional de 65% de 72 especies focales variaron significativamente entre ocho comunidades de vegetación montana que van desde sabana con robles y bosques a baja elevaciones hasta bosque de pino y bosque de coníferas mixto a altas elevaciones. Mayores proporciones de especies ocurrieron en densidades pico o se encontraron relativamente restringidas a bosque mixto de coníferas y a vegetación montana riparia, seguramente debido a los altos niveles de estructura o de diversidad florística en esas comunidades, pero dichas especies fueron típicamente raras o poco comunes en las Islas del Cielo. Pocas especies tuvieron su densidad pico en bosques de roble y pino-roble, y las especies asociadas con estas comunidades fueron muchas veces muy abundantes a lo largo de la región. Los modelos de hábitat muchas veces incluyeron el efecto de la cobertura vegetal decidua de hoja ancha (30% de las especies), que junto con la densidad de árboles y la severidad de los incendios, tuvo un efecto positivo en las densidades y sugieren formas a los encargados de planes de manejo para aumentar y conservar poblaciones. Dichos patrones combinados con las mayores amenazas en bosques de coníferas de altura y áreas riparias recalcan su valor para la conservación. Poblaciones significativas de varias especies de aves reproductivas, incluyendo algunas que son de interés o no eran conocidas sus ocurrencias regionales o en las cadenas montañosas que hemos sondeado, resaltan la importancia de los esfuerzos de conservación en esta área de México.

T1  - Avian relationships with wildfire at two dry forest locations with&#xa0;different historical fire regimes
AN  - 2446469637
AB  - Wildfire is a key factor influencing bird community composition in western North American forests. We need to understand species and community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following wildfire (Arizona: 1997–1999; Idaho: 2008–2010) and used multispecies hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed‐severity fire regimes characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our prediction for the low‐severity fire regime characterizing that location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In contrast, canopy‐nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire. We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining avian diversity could differ regionally. Specifically, intensive fuels management may be ecologically less appropriate for promoting biodiversity in areas such as the Idaho location where mixed‐severity wildfires and dense forest stands were historically more common.

T1  - An integrated occupancy and space‐use model to predict abundance of imperfectly detected, territorial vertebrates
AN  - 2374347749
AB  - It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape‐scale occupancy probability and habitat‐scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory.We demonstrate this model on the Black‐backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post‐fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home‐range size models and predict abundance of Black‐backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires.The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine‐scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home‐range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black‐backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade‐offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post‐fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

T1  - Avian relationships with wildfire at two dry forest locations with&#xa0;different historical fire regimes
AN  - 2313775511
AB  - Wildfire is a key factor influencing bird community composition in western North American forests. We need to understand species and community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following wildfire (Arizona: 1997–1999; Idaho: 2008–2010) and used multispecies hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed‐severity fire regimes characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our prediction for the low‐severity fire regime characterizing that location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In contrast, canopy‐nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire. We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining avian diversity could differ regionally. Specifically, intensive fuels management may be ecologically less appropriate for promoting biodiversity in areas such as the Idaho location where mixed‐severity wildfires and dense forest stands were historically more common.

T1  - Climate and Fire Scenario Uncertainty Dominate the Evaluation of Options for Conserving the Great Desert Skink
AN  - 2289638301
AB  - Fire regimes are predicted to change under climate change, with associated impacts on species and ecosystems. However, the magnitude and direction of regime changes are uncertain, as will be species’ responses. For many species, how they respond will determine their medium‐long‐term viability. We propagate fire regime and species’ response uncertainties through a 50‐year viability analysis of the great desert skink, Liopholis kintorei, in central Australia, characterizing fire regime change under three scenarios. Species’ response uncertainty was characterized with three competing models based on fire and habitat variables, fitted to 11 years of occupancy data. We evaluate fire management options for conserving the species, based on their robustness to uncertainty about fire and species’ response. Efforts to minimize the frequency and size of fires provides the most consistent improvements to species’ persistence. We show that disentangling important from unimportant uncertainties enables conservation managers to make more efficient, defensible decisions.

T1  - Transhumance in Central Anatolia: A Resilient Interdependence Between Biological and Cultural Diversity
AN  - 1791567105
AB  - Transhumance is a resource efficient means of livestock production by seasonally moving grazing animals to utilize pastures between varying ecological zones. This article investigated the interrelationship between the environmental services the transhumant provides whilst maintaining its cultural heritage and theorized what the cultural and environmental impacts would be if the practice of transhumance were to vanish. The authors interviewed 45 transhumant families during their 2015 seasonal migration through the Taurus Mountains and in their settled tent sites in Central Anatolia. The interview topics related to geography of the region, migration routes, natural resource constraints and opportunities, animal husbandry, grazing strategies and their income sources. By practicing agro-ecological principles over millennia, the research showed that the transhumant has helped shape a complex mosaic of habitats in one of Mediterranean's most interesting ecosystems. The mobile pastoralist with conservation and natural resource management skills over a long period has reduced erosion control, improved soil quality and deterred the likelihood of forest fires, whilst weaving a resilient social web. The survey also indicated a clear link between social and ecological resilience emphasizing that sustainable development relies on the interconnectedness between biological and cultural diversity. The study recommends special provisions be made by the Turkish government for the educational needs for the children of the transhumant, provide initiatives for improved trading of their produce, introduce law enforcement for oppressive behavior against them and finally support the pastoralists to attain world heritage listing as a unique and an irreplaceable culture for the future welfare of humankind.

T1  - The Effect of Seasonal Ambient Temperatures on Fire-Stimulated Germination of Species with Physiological Dormancy: A Case Study Using Boronia (Rutaceae)
AN  - 1790963623
AB  - Dormancy and germination requirements determine the timing and magnitude of seedling emergence, with important consequences for seedling survival and growth. Physiological dormancy is the most widespread form of dormancy in flowering plants, yet the seed ecology of species with this dormancy type is poorly understood in fire-prone vegetation. The role of seasonal temperatures as germination cues in these habitats is often overlooked due to a focus on direct fire cues such as heat shock and smoke, and little is known about the combined effects of multiple fire-related cues and environmental cues as these are seldom assessed in combination. We aimed to improve understanding of the germination requirements of species with physiological dormancy in fire-prone floras by investigating germination responses across members of the Rutaceae from south eastern Australia. We used a fully factorial experimental design to quantify the individual and combined effects of heat shock, smoke and seasonal ambient temperatures on germination of freshly dispersed seeds of seven species of Boronia, a large and difficult-to-germinate genus. Germination syndromes were highly variable but correlated with broad patterns in seed morphology and phylogenetic relationships between species. Seasonal temperatures influenced the rate and/or magnitude of germination responses in six species, and interacted with fire cues in complex ways. The combined effects of heat shock and smoke ranged from neutral to additive, synergistic, unitive or negative and varied with species, seasonal temperatures and duration of incubation. These responses could not be reliably predicted from the effect of the application of single cues. Based on these findings, fire season and fire intensity are predicted to affect both the magnitude and timing of seedling emergence in wild populations of species with physiological dormancy, with important implications for current fire management practices and for population persistence under climate change.

T1  - Long-term demographic trends in a fire-suppressed mixed-conifer forest
AN  - 1789777430
AB  - In the western United States, forests are experiencing novel environmental conditions related to a changing climate and a suppression of the historical fire regime. Mixed-conifer forests, considered resilient to disturbance due to their heterogeneity in structure and composition, appear to be shifting to a more homogeneous state, but the timescale of these shifts is not well understood. Our objective was to assess the effects of climate and fire suppression on stand dynamics and demographic rates of an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in the Sierra Nevada. We used a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to quantify species and community rates of recruitment, growth, and mortality. Despite a warming climate, we found that stand density, basal area, and carbon have increased over 56 years. Fir recruitment and growth significantly exceeded the community-level median rates, whereas pine recruitment and growth was significantly lower than the community-level median rates. Shifts in species composition from a well-mixed stand to a more dense fir-dominated stand appear to be driven by low growth and recruitment rates of pines relative to firs. In forests such as these with consistent and relatively low mortality rates, we recommend that restoration and management activities be focused on promoting pine recruitment and growth.

T1  - An integrated occupancy and space-use model to predict abundance of imperfectly detected, territorial vertebrates
AN  - 1787942846
AB  - Summary

              
It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.

              
Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory.

              
We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires.

              
The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

T1  - Resource selection reflects fitness associations for an endangered bird in restored habitat
AN  - 1781468544
AB  - Conservation practitioners frequently have limited information on the structure and function of the ecosystems they wish to preserve, and as a result, they may use shortcuts to guide conservation actions. One such shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida. Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area, namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism.

T1  - Vertical distribution of three longhorned beetle species (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in burned trees of the boreal forest
AN  - 1781336176
AB  - This study aimed to characterize the vertical distribution of longhorned beetle larvae in burned trees of the eastern Canadian boreal forest. Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns & Poggenb.) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) trees burned at three severity levels were cut, and 30 cm boles were collected from the ground up to a height of 9.45 m. Boles were debarked and dissected to collect insect larvae. Results show that the three most abundant longhorned beetle species were vertically segregated among burned jack pine and black spruce trees, but the section having the highest timber value was heavily infested by woodborer larvae. Larval density distribution of Monochamus scutellatus scutellatus (Say) and of Acmaeops proteus proteus (Kirby) could be linked with bark thickness, which also depends on fire severity. Lightly burned stands of black spruce were the most heavily infested and should be salvaged only if they are easily accessible and can thus be rapidly harvested and processed at the mill. More severely burned stands should be salvaged later as they will be less affected by woodborers, as should jack pine, which is lightly infested compared with black spruce. The ecological role of stumps should be further investigated because they could still have an ecological value after salvage logging as Arhopalus foveicollis (Haldeman) uses them specifically.

T1  - Prescribed fire alters surface activity and movement behavior of a terrestrial salamander
AN  - 1779668322
AB  - Prescribed fire has become a commonly used forest management tool for reducing the occurrence of severe wildfires, decreasing fuel loads and reestablishing the historic ecological influences of fire. Investigating population-level wildlife responses to prescribed fire is important for evaluating the effects of fire management on animals, but in order to predict and simulate wildlife responses to potential management actions, mechanistic studies that elucidate individual-level responses are also necessary. We used radio-frequency identification to investigate individual-level responses of western slimy salamanders Plethodon albagula to prescribed fire. We compared the salamander home-range sizes [minimum convex polygons (MCP)], movement behaviors, and activity levels before and after prescribed fire using a randomized block experiment. We initiated the study at three plots in 2011, and added two new plots in 2012. We captured, tagged and released ≥38 salamanders at each plot from May 2011-May 2012 (total N = 205). We recorded 918 total recaptures of 142 unique salamanders; 31% of tagged salamanders were never recaptured. Across all years and treatments, only 14% of relocations were surface-active (i.e. visually confirmed) salamanders; the others were underground. Following prescribed fire, the surface-active proportion of recaptures was nearly seven times greater in control versus burned areas, which indicates that P. albagula respond to post-prescribed fire conditions by spending more time belowground. We did not find evidence of direct mortality of salamanders from fires; the proportion of known-alive individuals did not differ between treatments. Maximum daily displacement was 43.3% higher among burn-area than control-area salamanders, and MCP varied in a similar pattern; this may indicate salamanders were attempting to find more hospitable microenvironments or other resources, such as prey. Together, these individual-level observations corroborate our findings from a population-level study of a congeneric terrestrial salamander and contribute to our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms underlying population dynamics.

T1  - The contrasting nature of woody plant species in different neotropical forest biomes reflects differences in ecological stability
AN  - 1768113322
AB  - 25

              
I.

              
I. Introduction

              
The goal of this paper is to review species-level phylogenetic studies of clades of woody, tropical plants that have sampled numerous individuals within species and thereby can provide insights into their history. In particular, we examine whether in a phylogenetic context species are resolved as monophyletic groups (see Table  glossary) and consider their inferred ages. The majority of studies we review come from genera characteristic of the seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) biome in Latin America, and we are able to compare these with a much more limited number of examples from the tropical rain forest biome there. Based upon these examples, we make predictions about the phylogenetic structure of species in lowland neotropical biomes. We suggest that widespread, abundant species found in the major expanses of rain forest (Amazonia and the Guianas) and savanna (the 'cerrado' of central Brazil) are more likely to be nonmonophyletic, with more range-restricted daughter species embedded within them. By contrast, species endemic to the SDTF biome, especially those from drier, succulent-rich woodlands (sensu Schrire et al., ), are more likely to be monophyletic and range-restricted. If true, these predictions have considerable implications, for example in understanding the evolutionary differences between these tropical biomes and especially the nature of the suite of woody species that have been shown to dominate overwhelmingly both Amazonia (Pitman et al., , ; ter Steege et al., ) and the Brazilian cerrado (Bridgewater et al., ).

II. Neotropical biomes

              
Insights in this paper flow from a consideration of major biomes in the Neotropics as distinct evolutionary theatres. Put simply, we consider that studying tropical biogeography and diversification by considering all organisms as merely 'tropical', as is the case in many studies, especially in macroecology (e.g. Mittelbach et al., ), can obscure patterns and processes that are distinct among tropical biomes (Fine & Ree, ; Pennington et al., ; Hughes et al., ; Oliveira-Filho et al., ). We aim to demonstrate that it can be more fruitful to consider the influence of the ecology of different major biomes on phylogenetic and biogeographical patterns in order to gain insights into the evolutionary process. Central to our argument is a concept that we should not examine plant diversification and biogeography solely within a framework of the effect of historical climatic and geological events. It is equally important to consider the influence of intrinsic attributes of organisms that reflect the major biome that they inhabit (Baker et al., ), such as drought tolerance and the ability to survive fire.

              
Against this background, an understanding of the three major lowland neotropical biomes of rain forest, SDTF and savanna is important (Pennington et al., , ; Fig. ). From an ecological perspective, these biomes are defined by variation in climate, edaphic factors and fire regime. Rain forest is found in areas with humid climates on a variety of soil types and seasonal flooding regimes (Whitmore, ; Fine et al., ), but in areas with significant dry seasons, gives way to savanna and SDTF (Malhi et al., ). Within these drier regions, SDTF grows on soils of relatively high pH and nutrient status, while savanna is found on acid, dystrophic soils (Furley & Ratter, ; Pennington et al., ). Fire has not been an important ecological factor in SDTF, whereas the abundance of C4 grasses makes the more productive savannas flammable in the dry season (Pennington et al., ; Lehmann et al., ).

III. Coalescence

              
A major focus of this review is to examine how accessions representing individual species are resolved in DNA-based phylogenies. An important conceptual background in this context is coalescent theory (Kingman, , ; Hudson, ). The coalescent theory was developed using the Wright-Fisher model, which occupies a central role in population genetics. For the context of this article on plant species, a very useful recent review for the nonspecialist is provided by Naciri & Linder (). We emphasize that we are not using the background of the coalescent theory in its more usual population genetic context, for example to estimate effective population sizes or types of selection. We are using it to understand why DNA sequences from a given locus sampled from multiple individuals across the geographical distribution of a single plant species may or may not coalesce - be resolved as monophyletic - with respect to sequences from the same locus sampled from individuals of closely related species. Diverging species inherit mixtures of alleles for different genes, and, analysed in a phylogenetic context, some genes may indicate monophyly of a species, while others may cluster populations of different species together (Naciri & Linder, ). In the language of the coalescent theory, the genes that indicate species monophyly have 'coalesced' because ancestral polymorphisms have been eliminated in daughter lineages by drift or selection. In the plant systematics and phylogenetics literature, the term 'lineage sorting' is often used to describe the coalescent process (Doyle, ; Posada & Crandall, ), and the genes that do not coalesce within species are in a state of 'incomplete' lineage sorting (Naciri & Linder, ). In this case, ancestor and/or daughter lineages retain ancestral polymorphism through speciation events, and this will be reflected in nonmonophyly of species. Throughout this article, we use the shorthand of 'species monophyly', although strictly we should be referring to the coalescence, or monophyly, of conspecific DNA sequences.

              
Noncoalescence can reflect several factors, including hybridization and subsequent introgression, paralogous gene copies and inadequate taxonomy, and disentangling these may be difficult (Syring et al., ; Naciri & Linder, ). In the absence of these factors, the time to coalescence depends on the effective population size (Ne), which is the size of a theoretical population under the Wright-Fisher model that explains the genetic diversity observed in the population sample (Naciri & Linder, ). Ne will usually be smaller than the census population size (N) because of unequal reproductive success of individuals but, in simple terms, given two populations of equal genetic diversity, the time to coalescence will be much faster in small populations than in large ones.

              
However, Ne is complex and affected by various factors, which thereby influence time to coalescence. For example, genome organization has an effect - nuclear genome doubling by polyploidy will double the Ne of all loci, and haploid genomes such as plastids have half the Ne of the nuclear genome in hermaphrodites. In this context of genome organization, nuclear ribosomal DNA, frequently used in phylogenetics, presents additional complications, often occurring at multiple nucleolar organizing regions and subject to concerted evolution and homogenization of copy types within individuals (Claire West et al., ). Historical demographic changes will also influence Ne. For example, a population bottleneck followed by population expansion might result in a large, geographically widespread population with low Ne. By contrast, strong spatial genetic structuring within a species can lead to higher Ne than would be expected from the species population census size N. Other factors may influence the Ne of specific loci, rather than the entire genome. For example, loci far from centromeres experience lower recombination and will have a faster coalescence time (Naciri & Linder, ).

IV. Species from seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs)

              
Numerous phylogenetic studies have examined clades containing species confined to neotropical SDTFs, many of which sample multiple individuals representing single species (Becerra, , ; Pennington et al., , , ; Duno de Stefano et al., ; Ireland et al., ; Govindarajulu et al., ; Queiroz & Lavin, ; De Nova et al., ; Särkinen et al., ; Gagnon et al., ) . Previous reviews of these studies have emphasized the geographical phylogenetic structure found in these phylogenies - that related species tend to occupy the same geographical area - and that individual species tend to be old compared with those in neighbouring biomes (Lavin, ; Pennington et al., ; Särkinen et al., ). Here, we will touch upon these topics of phylogenetic geographical structure and species ages, but will place more emphasis on how multiple accessions of individual species are resolved in phylogenies.

              
In these phylogenies of SDTF clades, when multiple DNA sequences representing individual species are sampled, species recognized by taxonomists on morphological grounds tend to be resolved as monophyletic groups, often on long stem lineages, and with short branches in the crown group (Fig. ). This pattern of coalescence of multiple accessions of DNA sequences representing single species on long stem lineages is evidence for long-term evolutionary persistence of populations with small effective population sizes (cf. Barraclough, ).

              
The frequency of the pattern of conspecific coalescence of DNA sequences is exemplified by a number of studies, many of which are focused on legumes (Duno de Stefano et al., ; Pennington et al., , ; Queiroz & Lavin, ; Särkinen et al., ). Patterns of conspecific coalescence of DNA sequences and old species stem ages (often over 1 million yr (Ma); Pennington et al., ; Särkinen et al., ) may be frequent in the SDTF biome because of two mutually reinforcing factors: (1) the geographical distribution of the SDTF biome in small patches across the Neotropics (Fig. ); and (2) low immigration rates into these isolated patches.

              
The small size of many SDTF patches, for example in interAndean valleys, means that woody species that are endemic there can never achieve the huge population sizes that are possible for rain forest species in the vastness of Amazonia. The contrast of geographical scale is massive; the SDTFs of the Marañon, Apurimac and Mantaro interAndean valleys in Peru are estimated to occupy c. 3100 km2 in total (INRENA, ), only 0.04% of the size of the Amazon rain forest (an estimated 6 million km2; ter Steege et al., ). In addition, the geographical scatter of SDTFs across the Neotropics may cause dispersal rates among separate areas to be low, but we do emphasize that evidence for such long-distance dispersal events is found in phylogenies of SDTF plants (Lavin et al., ; Pennington et al., ; Fig. c (Coursetia caribaea var. pacifica)). We highlight the low rates of successful immigration into SDTF nuclei as a key factor reducing the possibility of achieving a larger effective population size - propagules may arrive by long-distance dispersal to an isolated SDTF area, but their probability of establishment is low. Low immigration is suggested by the biology of the SDTF system. In its natural state, SDTF was not frequently disturbed by fire over evolutionary timescales, as evidenced by the lack of fire adaptations in its constituent flora, and the abundance of fire-sensitive taxa such as succulent cacti (Pennington et al., , ). In addition, SDTF species are well adapted to survive severe droughts; if the rains fail, woody species simply shed their leaves and remain dormant. We suggest that SDTF has low, relatively constant mortality and recruitment rates and that rates of compositional change are slow. Low resident mortality means that the community is generally saturated (sensu Hubbell, ), which suggests that immigrant propagules are unlikely to establish as there is no space in the system. This hypothesis of low immigration rates is supported by the common finding of old age estimates for geographically confined clades of conspecific accessions of SDTF plants (Pennington et al., ; Särkinen et al., ). The combination of low immigration rates and scattered SDTF nuclei acts to isolate populations to the point where they have a high likelihood of becoming distinct species, which subsequently persist for long time periods.

              
In summary, the small patch size of SDTF at a continental scale and its ecological stability which restricts immigration act in concert to keep effective population sizes of woody SDTF species low, and this means that time to coalescence will in general be short and that the length of time of persistence of species will be long. In taxonomic terms, species recognized based upon morphology are likely to be resolved as monophyletic in DNA sequence-based phylogenies and often with an old stem age estimate (see 'VI. Ages of species' below).

              
In considering taxonomy, one benefit of the extensive sampling within species carried out in a broader phylogenetic context that we are advocating is that it can be an enormous aid to the taxonomic process. For example, in several clades of SDTF species, intensive sampling within species has suggested ranking at species level of populations that were previously noted as being only geographically distinct morphological forms (Duno de Stefano et al., ; Pennington et al., ; Queiroz & Lavin, ; Särkinen et al., ). In these cases, morphologically and geographically distinct forms of a single SDTF species are each resolved as distinct monophyletic groups. The reanalysis of morphology, geography, and molecular phylogenetic data resulted in the formal description of new species or the resurrection of taxonomic synonyms to the species level, each of which were found to be endemic to a relatively small SDTF area. An example is provided in Fig. (a), where Poissonia eriantha is shown to be a well-supported monophyletic group, reciprocally monophyletic with Poissonia hypoleuca and Poissonia orbicularis and with an estimated stem age of > 5 Ma. Poissonia eriantha and P. orbicularis were tentatively considered the same species, P. orbicularis, by Lavin (), but new field observations show clear and consistent differences in flower colour and size (Fig. a), and P. eriantha is now recognized at species level (Pennington et al., ).

V. Species from rain forest, with particular focus on Amazonia

              
1. Predictions

              
Well-sampled, species-level phylogenies that additionally sample multiple accessions of individual species of neotropical rain forest trees are infrequent. Because of this, we first make some predictions about how rain forest tree species, especially those that are abundant and widespread in Amazonia, may be resolved in phylogenies. These predictions are based upon consideration of the biology of rain forest tree species, and evidence that processes of dispersal, rather than vicariance, may underlie the biogeography of most Amazonian tree groups. We then review the admittedly fragmentary empirical evidence in order to see how it fits these predictions.

              
We suggest that massive population sizes, long life spans, and effective seed and pollen flow, all factors that characterize many species of rain forest trees, mean that retention of ancestral genetic polymorphism in them may be likely because time to coalescence will be very long. This suggests that many tree species with large effective population sizes will not be resolved as monophyletic in phylogenies when they are sampled using multiple accessions. Although it is not our intention to review all potential modes of speciation of Amazonian trees, which may be numerous (Bush, ), we suggest that noncoalescence will be common whether speciation is allopatric and driven by vicariance (e.g. by Pleistocene climate changes; Haffer, ) or dispersal, or parapatric and driven by selection (e.g. adaptation to edaphic conditions; Fine et al., , ).

              
ter Steege et al. () showed that 50% of all individual trees in Amazonia belong to just 227 'hyperdominant' species. These have a median population size of 5.79 × 108 individuals, which would suggest that time to coalescence would be long because of the influence of overall census population size (N) on Ne, which determines the rate at which gene lineages coalesce in a neutral context. As an example, a tree species with Ne of 1 million individuals and a generation time of 10 yr will require 50 million yr for monophyly to be achieved at all loci (Naciri & Linder, ). This may even be an underestimate given that for many tropical tree species generation times may be an order of magnitude longer (Baker et al., ). Of course, Ne may be additionally affected by the various factors outlined in 'III. Coalescence' above, but the sheer population size of many Amazonian rain forest tree species suggests that times to coalescence across their genomes will be extremely long. If such a species is the ancestor of two daughter species because its range is split by a vicariant event, unless these daughter species are very old, they are unlikely to be resolved as monophyletic. Similarly, if such an abundant species gives rise to a daughter species via long-distance dispersal events (i.e. a peripatric mechanism), while the daughter species may be resolved as monophyletic and with young age estimates because of the population bottleneck causing an initial small effective population size, the ancestral species would not be resolved as a reciprocally monophyletic sister group to it because its time to coalescence would be long (Barraclough, ).

              
Effective gene flow in Amazonia may also be contributing to the long coalescence times by helping to ensure that effective population sizes are large. Several decades of genetic research have shown that tropical trees are outcrossing, have extensive gene flow and maintain high levels of genetic diversity (Dick et al., ). Pollen dispersal, almost exclusively mediated biotically (wind pollination is rare in rain forest trees), has been shown to be effective, with dispersal distances of kilometres (Dick et al., ). Although tropical trees have more genetic differentiation among populations (Fst = 0.177) than their counterparts in the temperate zone (Fst = 0.116; n = 82), this result was driven by a few species that display high Fst because of major genetic differentiation across biogeographical barriers (e.g. the Andes). No similar review is available for tropical trees in Amazonia alone, but we predict that Fst values will be low, which would be indicative of little population subdivision.

              
Population genetic estimates of seed dispersal distances are rare for tropical rain forest trees, so making inferences of contemporary gene flow via seeds is difficult. However, recent phylogenetic studies of Amazonian trees suggest that historical long-distance dispersal has been a major force shaping the composition of local tree communities in the Amazon and Guianas region. Local and regional communities of Inga have phylogenetic diversity that does not differ from a random expectation (Lavin, ; Pennington et al., ; R. T. Pennington et al., unpublished), and this is duplicated in Swartzia,Protium and Guatteria (R.T. Pennington et al., unpublished), all of which are species-rich genera and often abundant components of neotropical rain forests. Put simply, the species found in a local or regional community are scattered across the phylogeny of each genus. Although they have not been examined quantitatively, visual inspection of the phylogenies of Clusia (Gustafsson & Bittrich, ) and Guarea (Pennington & Clarkson, ) suggests that they show the same pattern. This pattern of phylogenetic scatter is explicable only by these communities being assembled by historical dispersal (Lavin, ; Pennington et al., ; Pennington & Dick, ). The lack of any repeated geographical patterns across phylogenies suggests that processes of historical vicariance across potential suggested barriers in Amazonia (e.g. Lake Pebas) have not been important in speciation (Pennington & Dick, ; Hughes et al., ). Additionally, it is not a pattern of in situ regional diversification, which is what typifies SDTF phylogenies. It implies that immigration must be more feasible and more frequent into rain forest tree communities than into SDTF tree communities. Interestingly, in this context, Hubbell () estimated high immigration rates using relative species abundance curves among samples from neotropical rain forests. Rain forest communities may be more invasible by immigrants than SDTF communities because of higher and more variable rates of mortality and recruitment caused by drought (da Costa et al., ) and high levels of landscape instability over historical timescales, for example in radical changes of river courses across Amazonia (Hoorn et al., ). These disturbance events cause tree mortality, creating space in the community, meaning that establishment is more likely. By contrast, as outlined above, the ecological stability of SDTF may be restricting successful immigration.

              
Because of higher rates of successful immigration and establishment in neotropical rain forests, we predict that the pattern of phylogenetic nesting of mainly recently evolved monophyletic species embedded within progenitor species will be found frequently in rain forest tree genera, reflecting a progenitor-descendent speciation process by a peripatric mechanism with a role for peripheral isolation of populations of widespread species. Distinguishing this peripatric process from one of local habitat-mediated speciation, which has been suggested to be important in Amazonia (Gentry, , ; Fine et al., , ; Misiewicz & Fine, ), using phylogenetic data alone may be difficult, because the mechanism of a potentially abundant and widespread ancestor giving rise to an initially range-restricted daughter species predicts the same phylogenetic patterns.

              
2. Empirical patterns

              
It is notable that in many cases neotropical rain forest tree species are not resolved as monophyletic in phylogenies - there is not conspecific coalescence of DNA sequences. This is the pattern observed for Andira inermis subsp. inermis (Fig. ; Simon et al., ), Ficus inspida subsp. insipida (Coronado et al., ), Dussia tessmannii (Winterton et al., ), numerous Inga species (Dexter et al., ), several Protium species (Fine et al., ), and several Sapotaceae species (J. E. Richardson et al., unpublished data).

              
Some of these examples, such as A. inermis (Fig. ), F. insipida subsp. insipida (Coronado et al., ) and some species of Inga (Dexter et al., ), show clear patterns of phylogenetic nesting, the strongest form of phylogenetic evidence for progenitor-derivative speciation (Crawford, ). It seems notable that Crawford's review of progenitor-derivative speciation, which focused on temperate zone examples, pinpointed just one clear-cut example of phylogenetic nesting (Baldwin, ), whereas, despite the currently thin empirical evidence base, examples from tropical rain forests are not difficult to uncover. The two species nested within A. inermis,Andira multistipula and Andira jaliscensis, were indicated as close relatives based upon morphology, with A. inermis suggested as a progenitor species for both of them (Pennington, ). So, in this case, we suggest that this may be evidence for progenitor-descendent speciation, with ancestral genetic polymorphism retained in A. inermis, although we note that this conclusion is based upon a single genetic locus, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS). The same pattern is also shown in Protium subserratum (Fine et al., ), where a morphotype confined to nonwhite soils in Peru is a monophyletic group nested within a paraphyletic white sand morphotype. It is notable that this pattern of phylogenetic nesting of range-restricted species within widespread species, which we suggest may be characteristic of rain forest phylogenies, is not common in SDTF phylogenies, for example being seen only in one of 49 SDTF species sampled in the robinioid legume phylogeny (M. Lavin et al., unpublished), in the instance where Coursetia greenmannii is nested within C. caribaea (Duno de Stefano et al., ).

              
Of these rain forest phylogenies, Dexter et al. () sampled most thoroughly across a number of species (50) using ITS and chloroplast trnDT sequences. They discovered that eight of these species were paraphyletic, six shared sequences with other species (i.e. were phylogenetically unresolved) and four were polyphyletic. This was after using a reciprocal illumination process where species identifications based upon morphology were revised in the light of the phylogeny, essentially using a species concept that emphasized monophyly as a primary criterion. Despite this bias for species monophyly, they discovered that only 32 of 50 Inga species were resolved as monophyletic. In addition, the Inga study was restricted to only 30 000 km2 in Madre de Dios, Peru, 10 times larger in size than Peru's dry interAndean valleys, but still a tiny proportion of the entire neotropical distribution of Inga. We predict that sampling more widely across Inga's distribution and over all c. 300 species of the genus would be likely to result in discovery of further nonmonophyletic species.

              
In other cases such as Dussia (Winterton et al., ), Inga (Dexter et al., ) and Protium (Fine et al., ), some species are not resolved as monophyletic, but this largely reflects lack of phylogenetic resolution. As Crawford () pointed out, these unresolved patterns do not contradict a progenitor-descendent speciation mechanism, but clearly more evidence is required to resolve these phylogenies. Such unresolved patterns contrast with the general prevalence of species monophyly in SDTF groups. The lack of resolution may reflect the recency of speciation in many rain forest tree clades (see 'VI. Ages of species').

              
Noncoalescence may be attributable to several factors, including inadequate taxonomy, hybridization and subsequent introgression, and sequencing paralogous gene copies (see 'III. Coalescence'; Syring et al., ). Future studies using more extensive genomic data and breeding system experiments will be necessary to understand their influence, and we cannot rule out these factors as explanations in our tropical tree species examples. For example, Muellner et al. () and Cavers et al. (), suggested that nonmonophyly of Cedrela odorata (Meliaceae) reflects a need for a revised taxonomy to recognize morphologically cryptic species. In other studies, hybridization has been shown to operate in Carapa (Meliaceae; Scotti-Saintagne et al., ). However, while some workers consider that hybridization is an important evolutionary force in some tropical trees (Cannon & Lerdau, ), a breeding system study of six Inga species from Costa Rica demonstrated that all were inter-sterile and self-incompatible (Koptur, ), suggesting that frequent hybridization is unlikely. The lack of hybridization in Inga is also suggested by the morphological distinctiveness of sympatric species. Up to a remarkable 43 Inga species can be found in just 25 Ha of rain forest in Amazonian Ecuador (Valencia et al., ). If all these local Inga species were hybridizing, it seems unlikely that ecologists and taxonomists would be able to distinguish these species based upon morphology, and they have little trouble in doing so (Pennington, ; Dexter et al., ). It is possible that future studies using genomic data will demonstrate hybridization and introgression as a key force in tropical tree species diversification, and therefore explanations for species nonmonophyly, as recently demonstrated by the temperate herbaceous genus Pedicularis (Eaton & Ree, ). However, our purpose here is to suggest that it is important to explore other potential explanations for noncoalescence within rain forest species, or reasons why, when these species are monophyletic, most may be recently evolved. We suggest that in some cases the noncoalescence observed may be just that - a failure to achieve coalescence by lineage sorting - meaning that a species such as A. inermis is not necessarily a 'bad' species that needs re-delimitation.

VI. Ages of species

              
As alluded to above, perhaps one of the most important differences between the species from different tropical woody biomes involves age estimates of species. Phylogenies of woody SDTF plants that sample multiple individuals within species show characteristic patterns of branch lengths, with long stem lineages leading to the species crown group, in which branches are often short (Fig. ). When the phylogenies are dated, this pattern of branch lengths is reflected in old stem ages (Figs : the date when the species split from its nearest relative) and recent crown ages (Figs : the age of the ancestor of all extant conspecific accessions) for individual species (Figs ; Schrire et al., ; Duno de Stefano et al., ; Pennington et al., , ; Queiroz & Lavin, ; reviewed by Särkinen et al., ). For example, Särkinen et al.'s () review of five legume genera showed mean stem group ages for species confined to SDTF of 6.1 Ma. Comparison of stem and crown group ages of 38 species of Robinioid legumes confined to SDTF confirms this pattern (Fig. ). As explained above, the recent crown age estimates contrasting with much older stem age estimates for individual species is consistent with a signature of populations of small effective sizes that are persistent over evolutionary timescales and are difficult to immigrate into successfully.

              
Because few phylogenies of rain forest trees have sampled multiple accessions within species, making generalizations about ages of individual species is difficult. However, despite the fact that rain forest is the oldest lowland neotropical biome, the indications are that a higher proportion of species within it may be younger than species found in SDTF. Phylogenies of several species-rich genera indicate major subclades of species within them with crown group dates of 5 Ma or less (Pliocene and Quaternary; e.g. within each of Guatteria (Erkens et al., ), Protium (Fine et al., ), Trichilia and Guarea (Koenen et al., )). In all these cases except for Protium (Fine et al., ), the phylogenies have the drawback of sampling single individuals per species, making estimation of species crown ages impossible. However, the young age of the nodes separating the accessions of different contemporary species suggests that these are likely to be very young.

              
This vision of a greater proportion of young extant species in Amazonia than is found in SDTF, which reflects the ecologically dynamic or unstable environment expected of a tropical rain forest, may appear to be in contradiction with literature that emphasizes the Palaeocene age of neotropical rain forests based upon geological evidence (Burnham & Johnson, ; Jaramillo et al., ), and the dating of rate shifts in Amazonian tree diversifications in the Oligocene and Miocene (Fine et al., ; Koenen et al., ). However, we stress here that we are discussing the age of individual extant species, and even for clades such as Protieae, which have a late Oligocene/early Miocene (38-21 Ma) crown group age, many extant species are young (post-Pliocene), even if other species are older. Indeed, in many instances the dated phylogenies of rain forest trees suggest that many extant species date to the Pleistocene (e.g. Inga (Richardson et al., ), Trichilia (Koenen et al., ), Guarea (Pennington & Clarkson, ; Koenen et al., ) and Protium (Fine et al., )), which also runs counter to the view, based largely on early vertebrate studies (reviewed by Moritz et al., ), that tropical rain forest species in general pre-date the Pleistocene (Colinvaux et al., ).

              
We suspect that these young ages may reflect greater opportunities for allopatric species formation within large expanses of rain forest such as Amazonia. A clue to the source of these opportunities comes from the lack of phylogenetic geographical structure in phylogenies of Amazonian rain forest trees outlined in the previous section. This indicates high invasibility of rain forest communities by immigrants in this ecologically dynamic environment, which is suggestive that their speciation may involve a peripatric mechanism, where founder populations are geographically isolated just sufficiently for speciation to initiate.

              
The idea of a high proportion of young species in Amazonia may also appear to contradict the one available study that attempts to date the ages of a series of extant neotropical rain forest species (Dick et al., ). Dick et al. () used ITS and chloroplast DNA sequence data to infer ages for 12 widespread Amazonian tree species, sampling multiple individuals of each (9-20 individuals, and 50 in the case of Symphonia globulifera) using molecular clock techniques. They demonstrated that 9 of 12 widespread Amazon tree species have Pliocene or earlier lineages (> 2.6 Ma), with seven dating from the Miocene (> 5.6 Ma) and three > 8 Ma. It should be noted that, because Dick et al. () studied single species in isolation without sampling congeneric species, they could not infer species stem ages and that these dates represent crown group ages only. With the exception of two of these species, which come from genera where they are the single extant species (Symphonia globulifera and Poulsenia armata), we suggest that it is feasible that these widespread species are progenitors of younger daughter species that may be phylogenetically nested within them and potentially much younger. In the case of A. inermis, one of the Dick et al. () study species, this is the case (Fig. ), because A. jaliscensis and A. multistipula are nested within it. We do not deny that there will be some very old species in Amazonia. However, we suggest, based upon empirical evidence for young rain forest species in many species-rich genera (e.g. Inga,Trichilia and Protium) and our suggestion that long-distance dispersal may be driving frequent peripatric speciation, that many rain forest tree species may be young and potentially nested within older, widespread species.

              
Population genetic studies of single widespread rain forest species may be somewhat limited in their inferences if they fail to sample relevant phylogenetic diversity. This diversity is represented by other species, recognized as taxonomically distinct, which may be nested within the widespread species. Delimiting the correct scope of population genetic or phylogeographic studies will be done best in the context of a prior phylogenetic framework sampling numerous individuals of as many species as possible because it will identify these patterns of phylogenetic nestedness. The old ages that Dick et al. () estimated for the widespread Amazonian rain forest species are accurate, but any daughter species nested within them will be younger if they originated by a progenitor-derivative speciation mechanism. Dick et al.'s general conclusion is that, because these widespread species arose in the Miocene when global climates were far warmer, they should be pre-adapted to future higher temperatures. We do not dispute this conclusion for the species sampled, but it may not be the case for any species derived from them, which may be much younger, therefore originating in cooler climates, and within which selection may have changed traits conferring temperature tolerance.

VII. Species from neotropical savannas

              
There are two main areas of South American tropical savanna (Fig. ), the 'cerrado' which occupies 2 million km2 of central Brazil, and the Llanos which covers c. 300 km2 of Colombia and Venezuela (Blydenstein, ; Huber et al., ). The cerrado is much more species-rich, with a remarkable 10 000 vascular plant species, of which an estimated 35% are endemic (Ratter et al., ). Fossil evidence for C4 grasses, which dominate the ground layer of savannas, indicates that, compared with both rain forests and SDTF, savannas are geologically young, rising to dominance globally only c. 4 Ma (Edwards et al., ). This picture of geological recency for the cerrado is supported by dated phylogenies that show that cerrado-confined clades are never older than 10 million yr old (Myr), with most lineages diversifying at 4 Ma or less (Simon et al., ; Pennington & Hughes, ). Therefore, entire cerrado clades, which can number 50 species or more (in Mimosa; Simon et al., ), are younger than many individual dry forest species.

              
None of these cerrado plant phylogenies sample multiple individuals of species, but we predict that patterns will mirror those described above for rain forest. Like Amazonia, the cerrado is dominated by an oligarchy of widespread, ecologically dominant species (Bridgewater et al., ). Bridgewater et al. demonstrated that, from a total flora of c. 1000 tree species, 121 dominate the cerrado, contributing 66% of the total species composition and 75% of the Importance Value Index (a sum of relative frequency, plus relative dominance plus relative density) at any one site. The oligarchy of dominant cerrado species will have large population sizes because of the combination of their local abundance and large geographical ranges. Just as described for widespread, abundant rain forest species, time to coalescence may be slow within such species. Given that speciation events within the cerrado must be young - < 4 Myr in many cases - we predict that cerrado species will often be nonmonophyletic, especially those that are widespread and that may be progenitors for other species. Because the cerrado is disturbed by regular fire, which may cause mortality of plants, we predict that, like rain forest, it may represent a system open for successful establishment of immigrant propagules. We therefore predict that the phylogenetic geographical structure of cerrado clades may be low, like the pattern described above for rain forests - species from a given genus found growing together in local and regional communities are likely to be unrelated. Contrary to this, a phylogeny for Calliandra, a genus with high species endemism in the 'campos ruprestres' ('rocky fields'), a fire-prone, savanna-like vegetation found at higher elevations at the eastern margins of the cerrado, does show significant geographical structure of clades, with several to many endemics confined to specific areas (de Souza et al., ). This may reflect the island-like distribution of campos rupestres, and it underscores the need for better sampled species phylogenies from the main area of the cerrados in central Brazil.

VIII. Conclusions and ways forward

              
1. A better understanding of tropical plant species, especially widespread, dominant ones

              
The purpose of this review has been to use DNA-based phylogenies to investigate the nature of woody, tropical species. It leads to hypotheses that can be tested in future studies, for example that species from SDTF will more frequently be resolved as monophyletic with old age estimates, whereas widespread tropical rain forest and savanna species may often be nonmonophyletic as a result of noncoalescence of conspecific DNA sequences, or monophyletic but with younger stem group ages. We explain these differences here as a function of the expected evolutionary stability of a localized patch of SDTF in contrast to the frequent drought, physical disturbance or fire experienced by a patch of rain forest or savanna.

              
A clear route forward for phylogenetic studies of tropical plants, whether the purpose is investigating evolutionary relationships, biogeography or taxonomy, is to include multiple accessions representing multiple individuals of all species. Ironically, to understand tropical plant speciation it may be most important to sample thoroughly across common species, which are those most frequently ignored by field collectors, whose focus is on rarities. However, some of these abundant species are playing a disproportionate role in the earth system - 50% of carbon storage and cycling in Amazonia is concentrated in only 1% of its tree species (Fauset et al., ). Therefore, a better understanding of the nature of abundant Amazonian rain forest tree species is of great relevance, but few of them have been investigated in a population genetic, phylogeographic or phylogenetic context. We suggest a fruitful route to understand the evolutionary history and nature of these species will be a phylogenetic approach, sampling multiple individuals representing them and their congeners. Not all the 227 'hyperdominant' Amazonian tree species listed by ter Steege et al. () are geographically widespread, although most are (cf. the 'oligarchic' species of Pitman et al., , ). It is especially these widespread, dominant species that we predict will be shown to be nonmonophyletic, with other, often more range-restricted species nested within them, as demonstrated by our examples in 'V. Species from rain forest' above.

              
Our main purpose has not been to discuss how DNA sequence data may be used in the process of species delimitation, but there are clear implications in this area. As explained in 'IV. Species from seasonally dry tropical forests' above, in SDTF clades, intensive sampling within species has resulted in taxonomic changes (Duno de Stefano et al., ; Särkinen et al., ; Gagnon et al., ). However, in this context of taxonomy, we emphasize that just because species are resolved as nonmonophyletic in phylogenies, with other species nested within them, does not mean that they are 'bad' species that will necessarily require taxonomic redelimitation. For example, as pointed out in 'V. Species from rain forest' above, there are good reasons to suspect that they may be held together by highly effective gene flow. This genetic cohesion, allied to their morphological distinctiveness, suggests that they correspond to the lineage species concept of De Queiroz () and they may well be good biological species (e.g. sensu Mayr,  - i.e. with no genetic exchange with species they give rise to). If contemporary gene flow is not making them cohesive across their entire wide ranges, they may be on the road to disintegrating into a number of daughter species, but, because of large Ne and long generation times, the length of time required for widespread progenitor species to be resolved as monophyletic in phylogenies may be very long indeed. The concept of nonmonophyletic species in general is not new or controversial (Rieseberg & Brouillet, ; Knowles & Carstens, ; Naciri & Linder, ), and it calls into question the definition of species based upon some level of genetic exclusivity such as monophyly (Knowles & Carstens, ). Certainly, for some of the cases we have highlighted, such as A. inermis (Fig. ), a species definition based on exclusivity seems inappropriate and, as a consequence, identifying this species by unique DNA sequence variation (a 'barcode') may not be possible.

              
With some exceptions (Govindarajulu et al., ; Fine et al., ), the majority of the phylogenies discussed in this paper are based on just a few loci, and require further exploration with multiple loci, preferably numerous nuclear loci. Such data sets are becoming more widely available for plants (Weitemier et al., ), and, with such multilocus data in hand, we will be able to explore patterns of coalescence within species across a much greater number of loci. In addition to this, we believe that a novel approach to investigating species boundaries in tropical plants is offered by coalescent methods (Knowles & Carstens, ; Fujita et al., ; Aydin et al., ). Coalescent-based species delimitation methods use probabilistic models to test alternative hypotheses of species delimitation. Their background assumption is that species are independent evolutionary lineages (cf. De Queiroz, ), and such lineages do not need to be resolved as monophyletic in gene trees, which is why they may be especially appropriate to deploy for woody, tropical clades. Traditional taxonomists may be resistant to applying coalescent species delimitation approaches, but, as emphasized by Fujita et al. (), they would not replace morphological approaches to taxonomy. In fact, a morphology-based taxonomy is the starting point for erecting the alternative hypotheses of species delimitation for coalescent-based testing (e.g. in Fig. , should A. inermis,A. jaliscensis and A. multistipula be one species, or three?). Indeed, speaking as two traditional taxonomists, we suspect that using a coalescent framework for species delimitation may result in better agreement with traditional morphological delimitations than methods based on genetic exclusivity criteria in widespread Amazonian tree species, in which time to coalescence will be very long.

              
2. A better understanding of ecological processes across tropical biomes

              
Hypotheses about differences in the ecology of rain forests, SDTF and savanna, such as higher and more variable rates of compositional change in rain forest and savanna, are central to some of the ideas presented in this review. These hypotheses are, however, speculative and will be hard to test until there is consistent long-term ecological monitoring across biomes in the tropics. Currently, such monitoring using long-term ecological plots is well established in rain forests (e.g. the Amazon Forest Inventory Network (RAINFOR) and the Center for Tropical Forest Science and Forest Global Earth Observatory (CTFS-ForestGEO)), but it is less widespread and needs more development in SDTF and savannas.

              
3. A better understanding of biomes and biogeography

              
Densely sampled phylogenies, containing multiple accessions of all species, will certainly be a powerful tool for a better understanding of the nature of tropical plant species. An associated, perhaps more fundamental insight they can provide is into how patterns in plant phylogeny and biogeography differ among biomes. We have argued that the patterns found in densely sampled phylogenies of SDTF woody plants - a predominance of geographical structure and coalesced conspecific accessions with old stem age estimates - reflect that the SDTF biome is highly dispersal limited. By contrast, the lack of coalescence in conspecific accessions, young species stem ages and lack of geographical structure found in rain forest tree phylogenies reflect the distinct ecology of this biome. Therefore, a key outcome of this review has been to suggest that ecological processes operating over evolutionary timescales play a role in tropical biogeography, a view that is supported by recent studies of Amazonian trees (Baker et al., ) and birds (Smith et al., ). We suggest that such an approach emphasizing ecology might be more productive than that provided by the dispersal-vicariance debate (Nelson & Platnick, ), which has been the traditional background against which to discuss geographical structure in phylogenies. Patterns of reciprocally monophyletic clades of conspecific samples, generally interpreted as a signature of vicariance, may not suggest a single historical event but rather the on-going effect of ecological stability.

Summary

              
A fundamental premise of this review is that distinctive phylogenetic and biogeographic patterns in clades endemic to different major biomes illuminate the evolutionary process. In seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs), phylogenies are geographically structured and multiple individuals representing single species coalesce. This pattern of monophyletic species, coupled with their old species stem ages, is indicative of maintenance of small effective population sizes over evolutionary timescales, which suggests that SDTF is difficult to immigrate into because of persistent resident lineages adapted to a stable, seasonally dry ecology. By contrast, lack of coalescence in conspecific accessions of abundant and often widespread species is more frequent in rain forests and is likely to reflect large effective population sizes maintained over huge areas by effective seed and pollen flow. Species nonmonophyly, young species stem ages and lack of geographical structure in rain forest phylogenies may reflect more widespread disturbance by drought and landscape evolution causing resident mortality that opens up greater opportunities for immigration and speciation. We recommend full species sampling and inclusion of multiple accessions representing individual species in phylogenies to highlight nonmonophyletic species, which we predict will be frequent in rain forest and savanna, and which represent excellent case studies of incipient speciation.

T1  - Assessing the Effect of Disturbances on the Functionality of Direct Protection Forests
AN  - 1814170425
AB  - Forests provide direct protection to human settlements from hydrogeomorphic hazards. This paper proposes a method for assessing the effect of natural disturbances on the functionality of direct protection forests (DPFs) in order to prioritize management interventions. We georeferenced disturbance data for wildfires, wind and snow damage, avalanches, and insects and overlaid them to a region-wide DPF map. Within each disturbance polygon, we used a Landsat-5 TM image to identify DPFs with insufficient vegetation cover, by using a maximum likelihood classifier of 6 spectral bands plus 5 vegetation indices. For each disturbance agent, we fitted a generalized linear model of the probability of finding a forested pixel, as a function of topography, time since disturbance, distance from disturbance edge, summer precipitation, and drought in the disturbance year. DPFs covered almost half of total forest area in the study region. Disturbance by insects occurred in more than one sixth of all forests. Avalanche and wildfire occurred each in about one tenth of total forest area, and wind and snow disturbance in only 1%. In the last 50 years, disturbances had a recurrence rate of 3% every 10 years. Almost one sixth of DPFs are currently lacking sufficient forest cover. Wildfires resulted in the highest rate of nonforested pixels (42% of all DPFs), followed by avalanches (21%). Forest recovery was explained by time elapsed, distance from edge (for conifers), and aspect. Summer precipitation and drought had a mixed influence. Our approach to assessing the effect of disturbances on the functionality of DPFs is reproducible in all mountain regions using institutional or open-access geographic data and provides a tool to prioritize DPF management by indicating where restoration of protection is most urgent.

T1  - Avian response to fire in pine-oak forests of Great Smoky Mountains National Park following decades of fire suppression
AN  - 1785500844
AB  - Fire suppression in southern Appalachian pine-oak forests during the past century dramatically altered the bird community. Fire return intervals decreased, resulting in local extirpation or population declines of many bird species adapted to post-fire plant communities. Within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, declines have been strongest for birds inhabiting xeric pine-oak forests that depend on frequent fire. The buildup of fuels after decades of fire suppression led to changes in the 1996 Great Smoky Mountains Fire Management Plan. Although fire return intervals remain well below historic levels, management changes have helped increase the amount of fire within the park over the past 20 years, providing an opportunity to study patterns of fire severity, time since burn, and bird occurrence. We combined avian point counts in burned and unburned areas with remote sensing indices of fire severity to infer temporal changes in bird occurrence for up to 28 years following fire. Using hierarchical linear models that account for the possibility of a species presence at a site when no individuals are detected, we developed occurrence models for 24 species: 13 occurred more frequently in burned areas, 2 occurred less frequently, and 9 showed no significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Within burned areas, the top models for each species included fire severity, time since burn, or both, suggesting that fire influenced patterns of species occurrence for all 24 species. Our findings suggest that no single fire management strategy will suit all species. To capture peak occupancy for the entire bird community within xeric pine-oak forests, at least 3 fire regimes may be necessary; one applying frequent low severity fire, another using infrequent low severity fire, and a third using infrequently applied high severity fire.

T1  - Resolving future fire management conflicts using multicriteria decision making
AN  - 1756676363
AB  - Management strategies to reduce the risks to human life and property from wildfire commonly involve burning native vegetation. However, planned burning can conflict with other societal objectives such as human health and biodiversity conservation. These conflicts are likely to intensify as fire regimes change under future climates and as growing human populations encroach farther into fire-prone ecosystems. Decisions about managing fire risks are therefore complex and warrant more sophisticated approaches than are typically used. We applied a multicriteria decision making approach (MCDA) with the potential to improve fire management outcomes to the case of a highly populated, biodiverse, and flammable wildland-urban interface. We considered the effects of 22 planned burning options on 8 objectives: house protection, maximizing water quality, minimizing carbon emissions and impacts on human health, and minimizing declines of 5 distinct species types. The MCDA identified a small number of management options (burning forest adjacent to houses) that performed well for most objectives, but not for one species type (arboreal mammal) or for water quality. Although MCDA made the conflict between objectives explicit, resolution of the problem depended on the weighting assigned to each objective. Additive weighting of criteria traded off the arboreal mammal and water quality objectives for other objectives. Multiplicative weighting identified scenarios that avoided poor outcomes for any objective, which is important for avoiding potentially irreversible biodiversity losses. To distinguish reliably among management options, future work should focus on reducing uncertainty in outcomes across a range of objectives. Considering management actions that have more predictable outcomes than landscape fuel management will be important. We found that, where data were adequate, an MCDA can support decision making in the complex and often conflicted area of fire management.              Resolución del Futuro Manejo de Conflictos por Incendios con el Uso de Toma de Decisiones de Criterios Múltiples              Resumen              Las estrategias de manejo para reducir los riesgos que la vida silvestre presenta para la vida y propiedad humana involucran comúnmente la quema de la vegetación nativa. Sin embargo, la quema planeada puede entrar en conflicto con otros objetivos sociales como la salud humana y la conservación de la biodiversidad. Estos conflictos tienen la probabilidad de intensificarse conforme los regímenes de fuego cambien bajo los futuros climas y conforme la creciente población humana invada más los ecosistemas propensos a incendios. Por lo tanto las decisiones sobre el manejo de riesgo de incendios son complejas y requieren estrategias más sofisticadas que las que se aplican usualmente. Aplicamos una estrategia de toma de decisiones de criterios múltiples (TDCM) con el potencial de mejorar los resultados del manejo de incendios para el caso de una interfaz tierra silvestre-urbana altamente poblada, biodiversa e incendiable. Consideramos los efectos de las 22 opciones de quema planeada sobre ocho objetivos: la protección de casas, maximizar la calidad del agua, minimizar las emisiones de carbono y los impactos sobre la salud humana y minimizar la declinación de cinco especies distintas. La TDCM identificó un pequeño número de opciones de manejo (quemar los bosques adyacentes a las casas) que tuvieron un buen desempeño para la mayoría de los objetivos pero no para un tipo de especie (mamífero arborícola) ni para la calidad del agua. Aunque la TDCM hizo que el conflicto entre los objetivos fuera explícito, la resolución del problema dependió del peso asignado a cada objetivo. El peso añadido de criterios compensó al mamífero arborícola y a la calidad del agua por otros objetivos. El peso multiplicativo identificó escenarios que evitaban resultados pobres para cualquier objetivo, lo que es importante para evitar pérdidas de biodiversidad potencialmente irreversibles. Para distinguir de manera fiable entre las opciones de manejo, los trabajos futuros deberían enfocarse en la reducción de la incertidumbre en los resultados en un rango de objetivos. Será importante considerar las acciones de manejo que tienen resultados más predecibles que el manejo de combustible de paisaje. Encontramos que, cuando los datos fueron adecuados, una TDCM puede apoyar a la toma de decisiones en la compleja y continuamente conflictiva área del manejo de incendios.

T1  - Fire affects microhabitat selection, movement patterns, and body condition of an Australian rodent (Rattus fuscipes)
AN  - 1777198724
AB  - Resource selection by animals influences individual fitness, the abundance of local populations, and the distribution of species. Further, the degree to which individuals select particular resources can be altered by numerous factors including competition, predation, and both natural- and human-induced environmental change. Understanding the influence of such factors on the way animals use resources can guide species conservation and management in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of a prescribed fire on small-scale (microhabitat) resource selection, abundance, body condition, and movement pathways of a native Australian rodent, the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes). Using a before-after, control-impact design, we gathered data from 60 individuals fitted with spool and line tracking devices. In unburnt forest, selection of resources by bush rats was positively related to rushes, logs and complex habitat, and negatively related to ferns and litter. Fire caused selection for spreading grass, rushes, and complex habitat to increase relative to an unburnt control location. At the burnt location after the fire, rats selected patches of unburnt vegetation, and no rats were caught at a trapping site where most of the understory had been burnt. The fire also reduced bush rat abundance and body condition and caused movement pathways to become more convoluted. After the fire, some individuals moved through burnt areas but the majority of movements occurred within unburnt patches. The effects of fire on bush rat resource selection, movement, body condition, and abundance were likely driven by several linked factors including limited access to shelter and food due to the loss of understory vegetation and heightened levels of perceived predation risk. Our findings suggest the influence of prescribed fire on small mammals will depend on the resulting mosaic of burnt and unburnt patches and how well this corresponds to the resource requirements of particular species.

T1  - Collapse of an iconic conifer: long-term changes in the demography of Widdringtonia cedarbergensis using repeat photography
AN  - 1845218872
AB  - Background

              
Conifer populations appear disproportionately threatened by global change. Most examples are, however, drawn from the northern hemisphere and long-term rates of population decline are not well documented as historical data are often lacking. We use a large and long-term (1931-2013) repeat photography dataset together with environmental data and fire records to account for the decline of the critically endangered Widdringtonia cedarbergensis. Eighty-seven historical and repeat photo-pairs were analysed to establish 20th century changes in W. cedarbergensis demography. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was fitted to determine the relative importance of environmental factors and fire-return interval on mortality for the species.

              
Results

              
From an initial total of 1313 live trees in historical photographs, 74% had died and only 44 (3.4%) had recruited in the repeat photographs, leaving 387 live individuals. Juveniles (mature adults) had decreased (increased) from 27% (73%) to 8% (92%) over the intervening period. Our model demonstrates that mortality is related to greater fire frequency, higher temperatures, lower elevations, less rocky habitats and aspect (i.e. east-facing slopes had the least mortality).

              
Conclusions

              
Our results show that W. cedarbergensis populations have declined significantly over the recorded period, with a pronounced decline in the last 30 years. Individuals that established in open habitats at lower, hotter elevations and experienced a greater fire frequency appear to be more vulnerable to mortality than individuals growing within protected, rocky environments at higher, cooler locations with less frequent fires. Climate models predict increasing temperatures for our study area (and likely increases in wildfires). If these predictions are realised, further declines in the species can be expected. Urgent management interventions, including seedling out-planting in fire-protected high elevation sites, reducing fire frequency in higher elevation populations, and assisted migration, should be considered.

T1  - Improving Access To Military Aircraft During Civilian Wildfires
AN  - 2206256016
AB  - Citizens and many local firefighters poorly understand the use of aircraft for wildfire suppression. There is a basic lack of knowledge because wildfires in general and the use of aircraft for fire suppression are both complex and expensive issues. Although the photogenic qualities of an aircraft with a trail of red “slurry” (retardant)[1] over a wildfire are well known, the use of aircraft is regulated by many variables. Some of those variables include laws, resource sharing agreements, weather, terrain, fire behavior, aircraft capabilities, and many others.
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) is the agency with primary responsibility for coordinating the response to wildfire in the United States. The agency’s homepage states, “The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), located in Boise, Idaho, is the nation’s support center for wildland firefighting.”[2] The NIFC also manages the response of aircraft to wildfire. The benefit of aircraft response to wildfire is that, “Air attack can be useful in delaying fire growth, or even suppressing small fires, before ground resources arrive.”[3] Regardless, after water or retardant is dropped near a wildfire, firefighters on the ground must follow-up with additional measures to ensure that the fire is completely extinguished.
The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other federal agencies utilize aircraft to support personnel on the ground in wildfire suppression.[4] However, the national fleet of aircraft used for wildfire suppression is aging. According to a 2013 Government Accountability Office (GAO) study, “The average large air tanker is more than 50 years old”[5] Due in part to the small and aging USFS fleet, most firefighting aircraft, “Are obtained through contracts with private industry vendors.”[6] In addition to federally owned and contractually operated aircraft, the Department of Defense (DOD) also has aircraft available for wildfire suppression.
Fighting wildfires is not the DOD’s primary mission. However, both military helicopters and aircraft have been adapted to fight wildfires. Helicopters use a bucket suspended from a cable to drop water. C-130 military airplanes have been modified to fight wildfires with Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems (MAFFS). MAFFS units can discharge up to 3,000 gallons of water or fire retardant over a wildfire.[7]
The problem is that DOD aircraft are not dispatched to civilian wildfires in a timely manner, resulting in lives lost, property destroyed, and critical infrastructure damage, among other effects. This problem is the result of existing federal policies and long-term institutional inefficiencies. Current policy states that DOD aircraft are not dispatched to civilian wildfires until all USFS owned and/or contracted aircraft are engaged. This policy results in civilian aircraft responding from further distances when military aircraft are closer. The major research question is “What improvements can be implemented to existing local, state, and federal protocols to provide a more timely response to civilian wildfires by DOD aircraft?”
This thesis uses prescriptive research. Prescriptive research is similar to evaluative research but, “Goes a step further, beyond identifying success or performance or outcomes, and actually recommends solutions or new ideas. Prescriptive research (also known as normative research), comes up with an assertion, a solution, a proposal for how to address a known problem space.”[8] The desired outcome of this prescriptive research is to offer alternatives to the current system used for deploying military aircraft to civilian wildfires.
A system is in place that allows the USFS, state, and local governments to request, dispatch, and deploy military aircraft to civilian wildfires. However, this system must be updated to improve the efficiency of accessing DOD aircraft. This thesis suggests options to the current system of utilizing aircraft for wildfire suppression. One option is simply to maintain the existing system without modification. Another choice is to eliminate the use of DOD aircraft for response to civilian wildfires. In addition, this thesis suggests three options to improve the current system of utilizing DOD aircraft for wildfire suppression including (1) implement the DOD’s Immediate Response Authority (IRA) to use military aircraft at the same time as civilian aircraft, (2) modify laws that establish barriers to the use of DOD aircraft, and (3) encourage the use of more resource sharing agreements between local jurisdictions and neighboring military installations.
The thesis concludes with two recommendations to improve the response of military aircraft to civilian wildfires. The recommendations are to (1) take greater advantage of the IRA to consider the use of military aircraft at the same time that civilian aircraft are dispatched, and (2) modify existing laws that negatively impact the use of DOD aircraft to civilian wildfires.
The first recommendation is that the DOD should be utilized as a “first responder” through the IRA. The advantage to this recommendation is that firefighting aircraft of any kind are dispatched as soon as a wildfire is known. Utilizing the military in this manner augments civilian resources. This change could be implemented without any changes to existing federal laws or military doctrine. The change would simply be procedural in nature, requiring an update to the deployment policies of the USFS and the DOD.
The second recommendation suggests that two federal laws could be updated to improve the efficiency of DOD aircraft deployment to civilian wildfires. The two laws are the Economy and Stafford Acts. The Economy Act has been in effect since 1932 and represents the United States government’s (USG) long-standing desire to avoid competition with private business. However, the law is written in a broad manner, stating specifically that an order for resources with another agency may be requested if the, “Ordered goods or services cannot be provided by contract as conveniently or cheaply by a commercial enterprise.”[9] For many years, this phrase has been viewed as a restriction regarding the use of military aircraft. The Stafford Act includes the same bias to non-competition as the Economy Act.[10] This bias is problematic when considering specialized resources, such as aircraft. In addition, the Stafford Act restricts the time that federal resources can be deployed for emergencies to 10 days.[11] In the case of large wildfires, this timeframe is too restrictive, as many wildfires last much longer than 10 days.

T1  - Habitat suitability modelling for Hirola (Beatragus hunteri) in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya
AN  - 1757081108
AB  - Hirola (Beatragus hunteri) is one of the most critically endangered antelope whose population is in decline, and its extinction might be the first loss of a mammalian genus in Africa since evolution of modern man. This decline has been attributed to, but is not limited to, habitat loss. Despite hirola introduction to Tsavo East National Park, its population has been stagnating at about 100 since 1996, and the reasons for this are not well documented. This research was aimed at determining the species' distribution in relation to environmental variables. Data on the presence of hirola were collected between 2008 and 2011 through long-term monitoring of hirola using aerial census and ground tracking. From this, a model was developed to predict the species' habitat preferences. The model predicted that hirola preferred areas close to supplemented water, roads, seasonal rivers and water logged areas but avoided areas close to wooded grassland, tsetse infested and rapidly drained areas. This research concludes that hirola distribution depends on availability of fresh grass shoots, shade plants and tsetse-free areas. To increase hirola carrying capacity in Tsavo East National Park, it calls for habitat manipulation through irrigation of rapidly drained areas, provision of supplemented water, prescribed burning and introduction of tsetse control strategies. Résumé L'hirola (Beotragus hunteri) est une des antilopes les plus menacées d'extinction : sa population est en déclin et son extinction pourrait être la première perte d'un genre de mammifère en Afrique depuis l'évolution de l'homme moderne. Ce déclin est attribué, mais pas seulement, à la perte de l'habitat. Malgré l'introduction d'hirolas dans le Parc National de Tsavo-Est, leur population stagne à 100 individus environ depuis 1996, et les raisons n'en sont pas bien documentées. Cette recherche visait à déterminer la distribution de l'espèce en lien avec des variables environnementales. Nous avons collecté des données sur la présence d'hirolas entre 2008 et 2011 grâce à un monitoring prolongé d'hirolas, avec des recensements aériens et des pistages au sol. À partir de là, nous avons mis au point un modèle pour prédire les préférences de l'espèce en matière d'habitat. Le modèle indiquait que l'espèce préférait des zones proches d'apports d'eau, de routes, de rivières saisonnières et d'endroits saturés d'eau mais qu'elle évitait les zones proches de prairies arborées, infestées de tsé-tsé et rapidement drainées. Cette recherche conclut que la distribution des hirolas dépend de la disponibilité en herbe verte et en plantes d'ombre et de l'absence de tsé-tsé. Pour augmenter la capacité de charge du Tsavo en hirolas, elle suggère une modification de l'habitat par irrigation des zones rapidement asséchées, apport de suppléments d'eau, déclenchement de feux planifiés et introduction de mesures pour contrôler les tsé-tsé.

T1  - Functional attributes of two subtropical shrubs and implications for the distribution and management of endangered bird habitat
AN  - 1746861943
AB  - Aims

              
The fruits of Erithalis fruticosa L. and Lantana involucrata L. are important in the diet of US federally endangered Kirtland's Warblers (Setophaga kirtlandii) wintering in the Bahamas archipelago. These two shrubs occur in tropical and subtropical dry forests, including forests that have been subjected to recent disturbance. Despite their importance to the endangered warbler, the disturbance ecology of these shrubs is poorly understood. We sought to determine, based on functional characteristics of the plants, whether their presence is favored by a particular type or regime of disturbance.

              
Methods

              
We used data from field experiments (seed broadcasting and shrub cutting) conducted on the island of Eleuthera, The Bahamas to determine mechanisms of and conditions favoring establishment and persistence ('vital attributes') of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, which enabled categorization according to the plant functional types defined by Noble and Slatyer (1980). We then compared hypothesized distributions of these plant functional types among different anthropogenic disturbance regimes to observed distributions of E. fruticosa and L. involucrata in order to identify disturbance regimes most likely to produce habitat used by Kirtland's Warblers.

              
Important Findings

              
 E. fruticosa and L. involucrata were functionally categorized as widely dispersed but largely shade intolerant species capable of establishing or regenerating individuals after disturbance via both seeds and vegetative mechanisms. Both hypothesized and observed distribution patterns indicated the shrubs were favored by a regime of frequent disturbance producing open canopy and ground layers. Among the anthropogenic disturbances we examined, areas of large-scale land clearing combined with subsequent goat grazing most often supported E. fruticosa and L. involucrata, while the shrubs were relatively rare in burned areas. Utilizing the plant functional type framework in combination with field data to evaluate predictions of species occurrence among different disturbances regimes provides a strong theoretical basis for conservation strategies. Understanding which disturbance types favor a habitat of concern and the mechanisms by which they do so can aid the prioritization of areas for protection or the design of habitat management protocols.

T1  - Positive effects of ecological restoration on rare and threatened flat bugs (Heteroptera: Aradidae)
AN  - 1736888997
AB  - Intensive management of boreal forests has replaced natural disturbances, leading to losses of residual deadwood and saproxylic biodiversity. Declining population sizes have been well documented for insect groups such as bark and wood-boring beetles, whilst other groups such as flat bugs (Heteroptera: Aradidae) are less well-studied and little is known about their response to forest restoration. We conducted two restoration experiments addressing this lack of knowledge. We predicted the following responses to restoration: (1) artificial gap-creation and prescribed burning will attract more flat bugs than control stands, (2) increasing pre-burning fuel loads will have a positive influence on flat bug response to fire restoration. To test these predictions we conducted two field experiments; in Sweden we compared prescribed burning of standing forest with artificial gap-creation and in Finland we compared differing levels of fuel-load prior to burning. We found partial support for our first prediction, total numbers of flat bugs collected was higher in burned forest stands compared to controls in both countries. By contrast, gap-cutting only resulted in a marginal increase in the numbers and species of flat bugs collected. We found no support for our second hypothesis. The red-listed Aradus angularis and A. laeviusculus were primarily found in burned stands. Aradus betulae, A. betulinus and A. lugubris were more frequent in burned stands than gap-cuttings and untreated controls. Our study therefore suggests that ecological restoration, especially burning, is an efficient way of attracting flat bugs to suitable habitat, we therefore recommend ecological restoration to be incorporated in boreal forest management.

T1  - Post-fire habitat use of the golden-backed tree-rat (Mesembriomys macrurus) in the northwest Kimberley, Western Australia
AN  - 1736615575
AB  - Fire regimes are changing throughout the world. Changed fire patterns across northern Australian savannas have been proposed as a factor contributing to recent declines of small- and medium-sized mammals. Despite this, few studies have examined the mechanisms that underpin how species use habitat in fire-affected landscapes. We determined the habitats and resources important to the declining golden-backed tree-rat (Mesembriomys macrurus) in landscapes partially burnt by recent intense fire. We aimed to (i) compare the relative use of rainforest and savanna habitats; (ii) examine the effect of fire history on use of savanna habitats; and (iii) identify key foraging and denning resources. Habitat selection was examined by comparing the availability of eight habitat types around real (used) and generated (available) location points. Individuals used a range of habitats, but consistently selected long unburnt rainforest in preference to recently burnt savanna (1-12 months post-fire); however, recently burnt savanna was used in preference to long unburnt savanna. Tree-rats foraged in Terminalia hadleyana, Planchonia rupestris, Celtis philippensis and Owenia vernicosa, tree species that are found in a variety of habitat types. Individuals used a range of den sites, including cliffs, trees, logs, scree and stags found throughout the study area. Although multiple factors may have led to the decline of Mes.macrurus across its range, these results are consistent with the idea that changes in the savanna structure as a consequence of contemporary fire patterns could also have a role. The continued persistence of Mes.macrurus in the northwest Kimberley may be supported by land management strategies that conserve fruiting and hollow-bearing trees, and maintain the availability of fire-sensitive vegetation types.

T1  - Restoring fire-prone Inland Pacific landscapes: seven core principles
AN  - 1724196106
AB  - Context

              
More than a century of forest and fire management of Inland Pacific landscapes has transformed their successional and disturbance dynamics. Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands, while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow issues.

              
Methods

              
We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate their application with examples.

              
Results

              
Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers. Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent contagious disturbances.

              
Conclusions

              
To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems. We focus attention on landscape-level prescriptions as foundational to restoration planning and execution.

T1  - Habitat manipulation influences northern bobwhite resource selection on a reclaimed surface mine
AN  - 1722643055
AB  - More than 600,000ha of mine land have been reclaimed in the eastern United States, providing large contiguous tracts of early successional vegetation that can be managed for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). However, habitat quality on reclaimed mine land can be limited by extensive coverage of non-native invasive species, which are commonly planted during reclamation. We used discrete-choice analysis to investigate bobwhite resource selection throughout the year on Peabody Wildlife Management Area, a 3,330-ha reclaimed surface mine in western Kentucky. We used a treatment-control design to study resource selection at 2 spatial scales to identify important aspects of mine land vegetation and whether resource selection differed between areas with habitat management (i.e., burning, disking, herbicide; treatment) and unmanaged units (control). Our objectives were to estimate bobwhite resource selection on reclaimed mine land and to estimate the influence of habitat management practices on resource selection. We used locations from 283 individuals during the breeding season (1 Apr-30 Sep) and 136 coveys during the non-breeding season (1 Oct-Mar 31) from August 2009 to March 2014. Individuals were located closer to shrub cover than would be expected at random throughout the year. During the breeding season, individuals on treatment units used areas with smaller contagion index values (i.e., greater interspersion) compared with individuals on control units. During the non-breeding season, birds selected areas with greater shrub-open edge density compared with random. At the microhabitat scale, individuals selected areas with increased visual obstruction >1m aboveground. During the breeding season, birds were closer to disked areas (linear and non-linear) than would be expected at random. Individuals selected non-linear disked areas during winter but did not select linear disked areas (firebreaks) because they were planted to winter wheat each fall and lacked cover during the non-breeding season. Individuals also selected areas treated with herbicide to control sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) throughout the year. During the breeding season, bobwhites avoided areas burned during the previous dormant season. Habitat quality of reclaimed mine lands may be limited by a lack of shrub cover and extensive coverage of non-native herbaceous vegetation. Managers aiming to increase bobwhite abundance should focus on increasing interspersion of shrub cover, with no area >100m from shrub cover. We suggest disking and herbicide application to control invasive species and improve the structure and composition of vegetation for bobwhites. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.

The likely impacts of climate change on the frequency and intensity of wildfire highlights the importance of understanding how fire‐induced heterogeneity may affect different components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal mammals in fire‐prone forests in south‐eastern Australia. First, we used a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of arboreal mammals 2–3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence, with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt and understorey‐only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve as refuges for fauna in the post‐fire environment and assist recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate spatial aspects of fire regimes (e.g., creation and protection of refuges) for fire management in fire‐prone landscapes.

T1  - NON-INVASIVE SURVEY OF FOREST CARNIVORES IN THE NORTHERN CASCADES OF OREGON, USA
AN  - 1709798160
AB  - Several species of forest carnivores are of state or federal concern in Oregon and are or may be sensitive to timber management practices, wildfires, climate change, and other large-scale disturbances. We implemented a non-invasive survey of forest carnivores in the northern Cascades of Oregon during fall-spring, 2012-2014. We collected 111, 148 images from 21 elevated and 39 ground-level baited camera stations located from 586 to 2237 m in elevation. We detected (≥1 image) Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) at 9 ground stations, of which 4 also detected Coyote (Canis latrans). We detected American Marten (Martes americana) at 63% of all stations (elevation range = 1252-2237 m), including 5 of 7 stations located in areas that experienced wildfires since 1996 that covered >5000 ha. Other forest carnivores detected included Bobcat (Lynx rufus), Black Bear (Ursus americanus), Mountain Lion (Puma concolor), Northern Raccoon (Procyon lotor), American Mink (Neovison vison), weasel (Mustek spp.), and skunk (Mephitis mephitis, Spilogale gracilis); but we did not detect Wolverine (Gulo gulo), Canada Lynx (Lynx canadensis), Fisher (Martes pennanti), or Gray Wolf (Canis lupus). Future periodic non-invasive surveys of forest carnivores may provide information about changing species composition and distribution, especially in relation to climate change, vegetation succession, and potential recolonization by Gray Wolves.

T1  - Effects of prescribed burning on carabid beetle diversity in coastal anthropogenic heathlands
AN  - 1865257952
AB  - European anthropogenic coastal heathlands are threatened by the cessation of traditional management practices. Fire has a long history in the management of this landscape, and its effect on various species groups has been investigated in previous studies. However, the resolution of these studies is generally rather coarse and is biased towards plants. In this study, we investigate the species diversity and composition of carabid beetles over a 22-year chronosequence of time since last fire in a coastal heathland in western Norway. We show that burning increases alpha species richness, and is particularly important for the richness of typical open habitat species. Our results also show that there are clear compositional differences between assemblages along the chronosequence, supporting the value for landscape scale biodiversity of rotational burning. Species richness is also increased by a higher species turnover between consecutive years in patches that have been burnt recently as compared to patches that have not been burnt for a long time. We conclude that burning is important in maintaining carabid diversity in anthropogenic heaths, and that prescribed burns should aim to create a mosaic of different burn years, preferably with a bias toward younger stages.

T1  - Why do farmers burn rice residue? Examining farmers' choices in Punjab, Pakistan
AN  - 1748861991; 2011-892228
AB  - Burning agriculture residues has multiple negative effects including local air pollution, increase in black carbon and contributions to regional and global climate change. This study seeks to understand why farmers burn rice residue by analyzing the residue adoption choices of farmers in the rice-wheat cropping system of Punjab, Pakistan. Rice residue has to be burned, removed or incorporated into the soil in order to prepare fields for the next wheat crop. The most favored residue management practice in Punjab, in terms of total rice area, is complete burning of rice residue, followed by removal of rice residue. When farmers remove residue, it is pre-dominantly because they use it to feed animals. Each practice has different cost implications. Complete residue removal costs PKR 4586 (US$ 55) per acre, on average. Further, complete residue removal is, on average, 34% costlier to farmers than full burning of residue. Thus, farmers would need to be subsidized to avoid residue burning practices. A number of socio-economic factors influence farmers' residue management decisions. For example, the proportion of rice area allocated to full residue removal practice increases if the farm is owner operated or if the farmer has a larger number of livestock. On the other hand, the proportion of area that is fully burned increases with farm size, reduction in turn-around time between the harvesting of rice and the sowing of wheat, and the ease with which farm machinery can be used for preparing the wheat field. The study concludes that without some technological innovations to make rice residue removal and wheat field preparation less costly, it likely that this trend in residue burning will continue.

T1  - Dynamic Disturbance Processes Create Dynamic Lek Site Selection in a Prairie Grouse
AN  - 1719292364
AB  - It is well understood that landscape processes can affect habitat selection patterns, movements, and species persistence. These selection patterns may be altered or even eliminated as a result of changes in disturbance regimes and a concomitant management focus on uniform, moderate disturbance across landscapes. To assess how restored landscape heterogeneity influences habitat selection patterns, we examined 21 years (1991, 1993–2012) of Greater Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido) lek location data in tallgrass prairie with restored fire and grazing processes. Our study took place at The Nature Conservancy’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve located at the southern extent of Flint Hills in northeastern Oklahoma. We specifically addressed stability of lek locations in the context of the fire-grazing interaction, and the environmental factors influencing lek locations. We found that lek locations were dynamic in a landscape with interacting fire and grazing. While previous conservation efforts have treated leks as stable with high site fidelity in static landscapes, a majority of lek locations in our study (i.e., 65%) moved by nearly one kilometer on an annual basis in this dynamic setting. Lek sites were in elevated areas with low tree cover and low road density. Additionally, lek site selection was influenced by an interaction of fire and patch edge, indicating that in recently burned patches, leks were located near patch edges. These results suggest that dynamic and interactive processes such as fire and grazing that restore heterogeneity to grasslands do influence habitat selection patterns in prairie grouse, a phenomenon that is likely to apply throughout the Greater Prairie-Chicken’s distribution when dynamic processes are restored. As conservation moves toward restoring dynamic historic disturbance patterns, it will be important that siting and planning of anthropogenic structures (e.g., wind energy, oil and gas) and management plans not view lek locations as static points, but rather as sites that shift around the landscape in response to shifting vegetation structure. Acknowledging shifting lek locations in these landscapes will help ensure conservation efforts are successful by targeting the appropriate areas for protection and management.

T1  - Assessment of management practices for ungulates in old Oyo National Park, Nigeria
AN  - 1718402777
AB  - Assessment of the habitat management practices was investigated for four months to identify the various management strategies and threats affecting ungulates in Old Oyo National Park. The methods used for the study are observation techniques and questionnaire administration and data were analyzed descriptively. Results showed that four management practices (annual burning, anti poaching patrol, conservation awareness/education and boundary assessment/ surveillance) are in place for animals in Old Oyo National Park and they are not animal specific. Ungulates presently encountered in the study area are seven, Kob; Waterbuck; Bushbuck; Roan antelope, Oribi; Buffalo and Duikers. The threats to the Park vary in intensity among the ranges but the ones common to all the ranges of the Park are grazing, hunting and honey tapping. Mining is a major threat in Oyo ile range, while fishing with chemical is practiced in Sepeteri range; these threats have direct effects on the animals. Suggestion was made on the need to intensify anti-poaching patrol and conservation awareness to curb the level of encroachment into the Park.

T1  - Regeneration Dynamics of White Spruce, Trembling Aspen, and Balsam Poplar in Response to Disturbance, Climatic, and Edaphic Factors in the Cold, Dry Boreal Forests of the Southwest Yukon, Canada
AN  - 1712866737
AB  - The southwestern region of the Yukon Territory of Canada has experienced an unprecedented spruce bark beetle outbreak (Dendroctonus rufipennis) and an increase in the frequency of forest fires that extend beyond historical trends and that have caused significant impacts on forest structure and composition. A Strategic Forest Management Plan (SFMP) for the Champagne and Aishihik Traditional Territory located in the southwest Yukon was implemented in 2004 in response to the spruce bark beetle (D. rufipennis) infestation and increased fire risk. The plan has recommended salvage harvesting of beetle-killed stands as a strategy to facilitate the development of a timber industry in the region and reduce the fire risk around communities. One of the objectives of the SFMP is to maintain, restore, or enhance forest regeneration, which requires an understanding of regeneration dynamics in the region. In this study, we investigated the regeneration of white spruce (Picea glauca), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) and the relationship with climatic, disturbance, and edaphic factors within the region. Multivariate canonical correlation analysis was used to assess the weighted relationship between regeneration presence/absence and environmental factors, and negative binomial regression analysis was used to model regeneration abundance of white spruce, trembling aspen, and balsam poplar. We found that although regeneration of all three species responded positively to disturbance, the broadleaved species occupied disturbed plots at higher ratios than white spruce. Regeneration of broadleaved species was higher in open sites with exposed aspects, indicating a preference for warmer sites with higher solar radiation inputs. These findings support the hypothesis that if fire increased in the region with the warmer climate predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, then the region will probably experience an increase in broadleaved species, leading to a more heterogeneous landscape.

AB  - Western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis subsp. occidentalis) range expansion into sagebrush steppe ecosystems has affected both native wildlife and economic livelihoods across western North America. The potential listing of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has spurred a decade of juniper removal efforts, yet limited research has evaluated program effectiveness. We used a multi-objective spatially explicit model to identify optimal juniper removal sites in Northeastern California across weighted goals for ecological (sage-grouse habitat) and economic (cattle forage production) benefits. We also extended the analysis through alternative case scenarios that tested the effects of coordination among federal agencies, budgetary constraints, and the use of fire as a juniper treatment method. We found that sage-grouse conservation and forage production goals are somewhat complementary, but the extent of complementary benefits strongly depends on spatial factors and management approaches. Certain management actions substantially increase achievable benefits, including agency coordination and the use of prescribed burns to remove juniper. Critically, our results indicate that juniper management strategies designed to increase cattle forage do not necessarily achieve measurable sage-grouse benefits, underscoring the need for program evaluation and monitoring.

T1  - Temperate forest health in an era of emerging megadisturbance
AN  - 1705745432
AB  - Although disturbances such as fire and native insects can contribute to natural dynamics of forest health, exceptional droughts, directly and in combination with other disturbance factors, are pushing some temperate forests beyond thresholds of sustainability. Interactions from increasing temperatures, drought, native insects and pathogens, and uncharacteristically severe wildfire are resulting in forest mortality beyond the levels of 20th-century experience. Additional anthropogenic stressors, such as atmospheric pollution and invasive species, further weaken trees in some regions. Although continuing climate change will likely drive many areas of temperate forest toward large-scale transformations, management actions can help ease transitions and minimize losses of socially valued ecosystem services.

T1  - Previous year's reproductive state affects Spotted Owl site occupancy and reproduction responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances
AN  - 1704385315
AB  - Understanding interactions among site occupancy, reproduction, vegetation, and disturbance for threatened species can improve conservation measures, because important aspects of vegetation and disturbances may be identified and managed. We used 9 yr of survey data collected at 168 sites to investigate dynamic site occupancy and reproduction in a declining population of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) in southern California, USA. We used multistate models to examine the relationship among owl site occupancy, reproduction, high-severity wildland fire, and postfire logging, while accounting for variation in vegetation characteristics and variation in detectability. Both occupancy and reproduction were positively correlated with successful reproduction in the previous year. Tree cover (ha) in a site's 203-ha core area also was positively correlated with both occupancy and reproduction. We detected no effect of disturbance covariates on reproduction, given that a site was occupied. Fire and logging covariates were both negatively correlated with the probability of site occupancy, and the effect sizes of these disturbances were large in sites that were occupied by owls that were nonreproductive the previous year (reduced 0.19 by fire and 0.26 by post-fire logging), but small in sites that were occupied by owls that were reproductive the previous year (reduced 0.02 by fire and 0.03 by postfire logging). This study illustrates the important contribution of consistently occupied and productive breeding sites to this population of Spotted Owls, and demonstrates that both occupancy and reproduction at these productive sites exhibited negligible effects from disturbances. Our results suggest that sites with recent owl reproduction and sites with more tree cover in this study area should receive enhanced protection from management actions that modify vegetation utilized by Spotted Owls.

T1  - Fine-scale refuges can buffer demographic and genetic processes against short-term climatic variation and disturbance: a 22-year case study of an arboreal marsupial
AN  - 1697760445
AB  - Ecological disturbance and climate are key drivers of temporal dynamics in the demography and genetic diversity of natural populations. Microscale refuges are known to buffer species' persistence against environmental change, but the effects of such refuges on demographic and genetic patterns in response to short-term environmental variation are poorly understood. We quantified demographic and genetic responses of mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami) to rainfall variability (1992-2013) and to a major wildfire. We hypothesized that there would be underlying differences in demographic and genetic processes between an unburnt mesic refuge and a topographically exposed zone that was burnt in 2009. Fire caused a 2-year decrease in survival in the burnt zone, but the population grew after the fire due to immigration, leading to increased expected heterozygosity. We documented a fire-related behavioural shift, where the rate of movement by individuals in the unburnt refuge to the burnt zone decreased after fire. Irrespective of the fire, there were long-term differences in demographic and genetic parameters between the mesic/unburnt refuge and the nonmesic/burnt zone. Survival was high and unaffected by rainfall in the refuge, but lower and rainfall-dependent in the nonmesic zone. Net movement of individuals was directional, from the mesic refuge to the nonmesic zone, suggesting fine-scale source-sink dynamics. There were higher expected heterozygosity (HE) and temporal genetic stability in the refuge, but lower HE and marked temporal genetic structure in the exposed habitat, consistent with reduced generational overlap caused by elevated mortality and immigration. Thus, fine-scale refuges can mediate the short-term demographic and genetic effects of climate and ecological disturbance.

T1  - Patch-burn grazing management, vegetation heterogeneity, and avian responses in a semi-arid grassland
AN  - 1696851580
AB  - Anthropogenic changes to disturbance regimes in grasslands, and associated homogenization of vegetation structure, have been implicated as factors contributing to declines in populations of grassland birds in North America. We examined the influence of patch-burn grazing management, which employs spatiotemporal interactions between fire and livestock grazing guided by historical disturbance patterns, on vegetation structure and bird abundance in shortgrass steppe in northeastern Colorado, USA. All study pastures were grazed by cattle at moderate stocking rates from May to October each year. In the patch-burn treatment, we burned 25% of each pasture in autumn (Oct or Nov) each year during 2007-2010; control pastures were not burned. Patch-burn grazing management increased vegetation heterogeneity by generating short (<4cm), sparse vegetation on recent burns. Although cattle selectively grazed recent burns, this did not alter vegetation structure in unburned portions of patch-burned pastures relative to controls. Of the 6 grassland bird species we examined, mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) occurred exclusively on recent burns, whereas grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) occurred exclusively in grassland not burned for ≥3 years. Two species (lark bunting [Calamospiza melanocorys] and western meadowlark [Sturnella neglecta]) were 2-3 times less abundant on recent burns compared to controls, whereas densities of horned larks (Eremophila alpestris) and McCown's longspur (Rhynchophanes mccownii) were unaffected by burning. Lark bunting, western meadowlark, and grasshopper sparrow densities varied substantially among years. In the years when they were abundant, all 3 species increased in density across the time-since-burning gradient. Consistent with this pattern, patch-burn grazing management reduced the abundance of all 3 species at the whole-pasture scale. We found no evidence that unburned patches within the patch-burned pastures differed from unburned pastures in terms of the abundance of any bird species. Patch-burn grazing management was an effective strategy to create breeding habitat for mountain plovers. However, our findings suggest that in the shortgrass steppe, additional strategies that generate taller, more dense vegetation than occurs under moderate cattle grazing need to be considered in combination with patch-burn grazing management to sustain breeding habitat for the full suite of native grassland birds.

T1  - Darcy's law predicts widespread forest mortality under climate warming
AN  - 1766270805
AB  - Drought and heat-induced tree mortality is accelerating in many forest biomes as a consequence of a warming climate, resulting in a threat to global forests unlike any in recorded history. Forests store the majority of terrestrial carbon, thus their loss may have significant and sustained impacts on the global carbon cycle. We use a hydraulic corollary to Darcy's law, a core principle of vascular plant physiology, to predict characteristics of plants that will survive and die during drought under warmer future climates. Plants that are tall with isohydric stomatal regulation, low hydraulic conductance, and high leaf area are most likely to die from future drought stress. Thus, tall trees of old-growth forests are at the greatest risk of loss, which has ominous implications for terrestrial carbon storage. This application of Darcy's law indicates today's forests generally should be replaced by shorter and more xeric plants, owing to future warmer droughts and associated wildfires and pest attacks. The Darcy's corollary also provides a simple, robust framework for informing forest management interventions needed to promote the survival of current forests. Given the robustness of Darcy's law for predictions of vascular plant function, we conclude with high certainty that today's forests are going to be subject to continued increases in mortality rates that will result in substantial reorganization of their structure and carbon storage.

T1  - Geospatial characterization of deforestation, fragmentation and forest fires in Telangana state, India: conservation perspective
AN  - 1695964326
AB  - Conservation of biodiversity has been put to the highest priority throughout the world. The process of identifying threatened ecosystems will search for different drivers related to biodiversity loss. The present study aimed to generate spatial information on deforestation and ecological degradation indicators of fragmentation and forest fires using systematic conceptual approach in Telangana state, India. Identification of ecosystems facing increasing vulnerability can help to safeguard the extinctions of species and useful for conservation planning. The technological advancement of satellite remote sensing and Geographical Information System has increased greatly in assessment and monitoring of ecosystem-level changes. The areas of threat were identified by creating grid cells (5 × 5 km) in Geographical Information System (GIS). Deforestation was assessed using multi-source data of 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013. The forest cover of 40,746 km^sup 2^, 29,299 km^sup 2^, 18,652 km^sup 2^, 18,368 km^sup 2^, 18,006 km^sup 2^, 17,556 km^sup 2^ and 17,520 km^sup 2^ was estimated during 1930, 1960, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2013, respectively. Historical evaluation of deforestation revealed that major changes had occurred in forests of Telangana and identified 1095 extinct, 397 critically endangered, 523 endangered and 311 vulnerable ecosystem grid cells. The fragmentation analysis has identified 307 ecosystem grid cells under critically endangered status. Forest burnt area information was extracted using AWiFS data of 2005 to 2014. Spatial analysis indicates total fire-affected forest in Telangana as 58.9 % in a decadal period. Conservation status has been recorded depending upon values of threat for each grid, which forms the basis for conservation priority hotspots. Of existing forest, 2.1 % grids had severe ecosystem collapse and had been included under the category of conservation priority hotspot-I, followed by 27.2 % in conservation priority hotspot-II and 51.5 % in conservation priority hotspot-III. This analysis complements assessment of ecosystems undergoing multiple threats. An integrated approach involving the deforestation and degradation indicators is useful in formulating the strategies to take appropriate conservation measures.

T1  - Combining aerial LiDAR and multispectral imagery to assess postfire regeneration types in a Mediterranean forest
AN  - 1694534538
AB  - Wildfires play a major role in driving vegetation changes and can cause important environmental and economic losses in Mediterranean forests, especially where the dominant species lacks efficient postfire regeneration mechanisms. In these areas, postdisturbance vegetation management strategies need to be based on detailed, spatially continuous inventories of the burned area. Here, we present a methodology in which we combine airborne LiDAR and multispectral imagery to assess postfire regeneration types in a spatially continuous way, using a Mediterranean black pine (Pinus nigra Arn ssp. salzmannii) forest that burned in 1998 as a case study. Five postfire regeneration types were obtained by clustering field-plot data using Ward's method. Two of the five regeneration types presented high tree cover (one clearly dominated by hardwoods and the other dominated by pines), a third type presented low to moderate tree cover, being dominated by hardwoods, and the remaining two types matched to areas dominated by soil-herbaceous or shrub layers with very low or no tree cover (i.e., very low to no tree species regeneration). These five types of regeneration were used to conduct a supervised classification of remote sensing data using a nonparametric supervised classification technique. Compared with independent field validation points, the remote sensing based assessment method resulted in a global classification accuracy of 82.7%. Proportions of regeneration types in the study area indicated a general shift from the former pine-dominated forest toward hardwood dominance and showed no serious problems of regeneration failure. Our methodological approach appears to be appropriate for informing postdisturbance vegetation management strategies over large areas.

AB  - Identifying links between micro-habitat selection and wildlife reproduction is imperative to population persistence and recovery. This information is particularly important for landscape species such as greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse). Although this species has been widely studied, because environmental factors can affect sage-grouse populations, local and regional studies are crucial for developing viable conservation strategies. We studied the habitat-use patterns of 71 radio-marked sage-grouse inhabiting an area affected by wildfire in the Virginia Mountains of northwestern Nevada during 2009-2011 to determine the effect of micro-habitat attributes on reproductive success. We measured standard vegetation parameters at nest and random sites using a multi-scale approach (range=0.01-15,527ha). We used an information-theoretic modeling approach to identify environmental factors influencing nest-site selection and survival, and determine whether nest survival was a function of resource selection. Sage-grouse selected micro-sites with greater shrub canopy cover and less cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover than random sites. Total shrub canopy, including sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and other shrub species, at small spatial scales (0.8ha and 3.1ha) was the single contributing selection factor to higher nest survival. These results indicate that reducing the risk of wildfire to maintain important sagebrush habitats could be emphasized in sage-grouse conservation strategies in Nevada. Managers may seek to mitigate the influx of annual grass invasion by preserving large intact sagebrush-dominated stands with a mixture of other shrub species. For this area of Nevada, the results suggest that ≥40% total shrub canopy cover in sage-grouse nesting areas could yield improved reproductive success. Published 2015.

T1  - HABITAT PREFERENCE AND SURVIVAL FOR WESTERN MEADOWLARK (STURNELLA NEGLECTA) FLEDGLINGS IN A CONTIGUOUS PRAIRIE SYSTEM: A JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AN  - 1699252259
AB  - Grassland bird populations in North America continue to decline according to count and vital-rate data, highlighting the importance of remaining grasslands. Conservation efforts may be enhanced by understanding fledgling habitat preference and survival in relation to age and ambient temperature. We radio-tracked 46 Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) fledglings in 2006 and 2007 to evaluate variation in habitat preference and survival in subirrigated meadows of the Nebraska Sandhills, one of North America's largest contiguous grassland systems. Our research indicates that habitat preference varied with fledgling age and ambient temperature: at higher ambient temperatures, fledglings tended to select sites with deeper litter and shorter vegetation, while younger, mostly flightless fledglings tended to select sites with shallower litter and taller vegetation. We confirmed 23 fatalities, including 8 (35%) from predators, 2 (9%) from haying operations, and 13 (56%) from unknown causes. Seven of the eight (88%) depredated fledglings were tracked to live snakes, including six bullsnakes (Pituophis catenifer sayi). The probability of daily survival (0.981) was high compared to estimates for passerine fledglings in other grassland systems. Survival increased with age and ambient temperature but decreased with litter depth. Prior research indicates prescribed burning can decrease litter depth and associated abundance of snakes in grasslands, but neither are likely conservation strategies in subirrigated meadows of the Nebraska Sandhills, because hay production provides winter feed for cattle. We recommend maintaining mid to late summer hay harvest so first cohorts of nestlings can fledge, attain flight, and evade machinery.

T1  - Influence of Fire Mosaics, Habitat Characteristics and Cattle Disturbance on Mammals in Fire-Prone Savanna Landscapes of the Northern Kimberley
AN  - 1692019860
AB  - Patch mosaic burning, in which fire is used to produce a mosaic of habitat patches representative of a range of fire histories (‘pyrodiversity’), has been widely advocated to promote greater biodiversity. However, the details of desired fire mosaics for prescribed burning programs are often unspecified. Threatened small to medium-sized mammals (35 g to 5.5 kg) in the fire-prone tropical savannas of Australia appear to be particularly fire-sensitive. Consequently, a clear understanding of which properties of fire mosaics are most instrumental in influencing savanna mammal populations is critical. Here we use mammal capture data, remotely sensed fire information (i.e. time since last fire, fire frequency, frequency of late dry season fires, diversity of post-fire ages in 3 km radius, and spatial extent of recently burnt, intermediate and long unburnt habitat) and structural habitat attributes (including an index of cattle disturbance) to examine which characteristics of fire mosaics most influence mammals in the north-west Kimberley. We used general linear models to examine the relationship between fire mosaic and habitat attributes on total mammal abundance and richness, and the abundance of the most commonly detected species. Strong negative associations of mammal abundance and richness with frequency of late dry season fires, the spatial extent of recently burnt habitat (post-fire age <1 year within 3 km radius) and level of cattle disturbance were observed. Shrub cover was positively related to both mammal abundance and richness, and availability of rock crevices, ground vegetation cover and spatial extent of ≥4 years unburnt habitat were all positively associated with at least some of the mammal species modelled. We found little support for diversity of post-fire age classes in the models. Our results indicate that both a high frequency of intense late dry season fires and extensive, recently burnt vegetation are likely to be detrimental to mammals in the north Kimberley. A managed fire mosaic that reduces large scale and intense fires, including the retention of ≥4 years unburnt patches, will clearly benefit savanna mammals. We also highlighted the importance of fire mosaics that retain sufficient shelter for mammals. Along with fire, it is clear that grazing by introduced herbivores also needs to be reduced so that habitat quality is maintained.

T1  - Nowhere to Go but Up: Impacts of Climate Change on Demographics of a Short-Range Endemic (Crotalus willardi obscurus) in the Sky-Islands of Southwestern North America
AN  - 1691408722
AB  - Biodiversity elements with narrow niches and restricted distributions (i.e., ‘short range endemics,’ SREs) are particularly vulnerable to climate change. The New Mexico Ridge-nosed Rattlesnake (Crotalus willardi obscurus, CWO), an SRE listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act within three sky islands of southwestern North America, is constrained at low elevation by drought and at high elevation by wildfire. We combined long-term recapture and molecular data with demographic and niche modeling to gauge its climate-driven status, distribution, and projected longevity. The largest population (Animas) is numerically constricted (N = 151), with few breeding adults (Nb = 24) and an elevated inbreeding coefficient (ΔF = 0.77; 100 years). Mean home range (0.07km2) is significantly smaller compared to other North American rattlesnakes, and movements are within, not among sky islands. Demographic values, when gauged against those displayed by other endangered/Red-Listed reptiles [e.g., Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta)], are either comparable or markedly lower. Survival rate differs significantly between genders (female<male) and life history stages (juvenile<adult) while a steadily declining population trajectory (r = -0.20±0.03) underscores the shallow predicted-time-to-extinction (17.09±2.05 years). Core habitat is receding upwards in elevation and will shift 750km NW under conservative climate estimates. While survival is significantly impacted by wildfire at upper elevations, the extinction vortex is driven by small population demographics, a situation comparable to that of the European Adder (Vipera berus), a conservation icon in southern Sweden. Genetic rescue, a management approach successfully employed in similar situations, is ill advised in this situation due to climate-driven habitat change in the sky islands. CWO is a rare organism in a unique environment, with a conserved niche and a predisposition towards extinction. It is a bellwether for the eventual climate-driven collapse of the Madrean pine-oak ecosystem, one of Earth’s three recognized megadiversity centers.

T1  - Burning reveals cryptic plant diversity and promotes coexistence in a California prairie restoration experiment
AN  - 2299128776
AB  - Grassland and prairie restoration projects in California often result in long‐term establishment of only a few native plant species, even when they begin with a diverse seed palette. One explanation for the disappearance of certain native species over time is that they are excluded through competition. If so, management that reduces interspecific competition may favor “subordinate” natives and promote greater native species diversity in restored communities. Potential management approaches to accomplish this goal include intraspecific spatial aggregation during seeding and prescribed fire. However, no studies have experimentally evaluated the effects of fire on a controlled (restoration) species pool or the interaction between fire and spatial aggregation. In a previous California prairie restoration experiment, we demonstrated that aggregated plantings protected competitively subordinate species from exclusion and increased community diversity for three years. However, native species richness declined throughout the study, and the benefits of aggregated seeding had begun to disappear by the third year. For the present study, we resurveyed the experimental plots five years after seeding and in the following year carried out controlled burns on half of the plots. The four subordinate species and one of the previously dominant species continued to decline and essentially disappeared aboveground during years four and five. However, burning in year five decreased the cover of dominant natives, triggered the reappearance of the three subordinate species that had disappeared or nearly disappeared in previous years, and increased diversity of the restored community. Seeding treatments (aggregated or interspersed) did not significantly affect community‐level responses to the burning treatment. These results confirm that although initial intraspecific aggregation may promote species coexistence in the short term, re‐establishing disturbance regimes can allow coexistence over a longer time scale by revealing and potentially renewing seed bank diversity.

T1  - Occupancy of California Spotted Owl sites following a large fire in the Sierra Nevada, California
AN  - 1690684417
AB  - High-severity forest fire often is presumed to adversely affect the occupancy of territories by California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) because these owls are associated with mature and old-growth forests. We used single-season, multi-state occupancy statistics to estimate site occupancy probability for Spotted Owls at 45 historically occupied sites during the breeding season immediately following the 2013 Rim Fire, which was one of the largest forest fires on record in California. We quantified how occupancy probability was influenced by the amount of high-severity fire occurring in mature forested habitat within Protected Activity Centers (PACs). The model-averaged estimate of site-occupancy probability for at least a single owl was 0.922 (±SE = 0.073), which was higher than other published occupancy probability estimates for this subspecies in either burned or long-unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada. Mean site-occupancy probability for pairs was 0.866 (±0.093), and most sites (33) were occupied by pairs. The amount of high-severity fire in the PAC did not affect pair occupancy. Occupancy probability by at least a single bird was negatively correlated with the amount of high severity fire in the PAC but remained >0.89 in 100% high-severity burned PACs. These data add to observations that California Spotted Owls continue to use post-fire landscapes, even when the fires were large and where large areas burned at high severity, suggesting that owls are not generally negatively impacted by high-severity fire. Based on this and other studies of Spotted Owls, fire, and logging, we suggest land managers consider burned forest within and surrounding PACs as potentially suitable California Spotted Owl foraging habitat when planning and implementing management activities, and we recommend against logging burned forest within at least 1.5 km of nests or roosts for the conservation and recovery of this declining subspecies.

T1  - Success of Seeding Native Compared with Introduced Perennial Vegetation for Revegetating Medusahead-Invaded Sagebrush Rangeland *,**
AN  - 1685017624
AB  - Millions of hectares of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. wyomingensis Beetle &Young) rangeland have been invaded by medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski), an exotic annual grass that degradeswildlife habitat, reduces forage production, and decreases biodiversity. Revegetation of medusahead-invaded sagebrush plant communities is necessary to restore ecosystem services. The authors compared the results of seeding native and introduced perennial species after controlling medusahead with prescribed burning followed with an imazapic herbicide application at five sites. Perennial bunchgrass cover and density were 5- and 10-fold greater in areas seeded with introduced compared with native species 3 years post seeding. Seeded introduced and native shrubs largely failed to establish. High perennial bunchgrass density in areas seeded with introduced species in the third year post seeding suggests that the succession trajectory of these communities has shifted to becoming perennial dominated. These results suggest that seeding introduced comparedwith native species after medusahead controlwill likely bemore successful.

T1  - Forest Health in a Changing World
AN  - 1674611678
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Forest Microbiome

              
Forest pathology, the science of forest health and tree diseases, is operating in a rapidly developing environment. Most importantly, global trade and climate change are increasing the threat to forest ecosystems posed by new diseases. Various studies relevant to forest pathology in a changing world are accumulating, thus making it necessary to provide an update of recent literature. In this contribution, we summarize research at the interface between forest pathology and landscape ecology, biogeography, global change science and research on tree endophytes. Regional outbreaks of tree diseases are requiring interdisciplinary collaboration, e.g. between forest pathologists and landscape ecologists. When tree pathogens are widely distributed, the factors determining their broad-scale distribution can be studied using a biogeographic approach. Global change, the combination of climate and land use change, increased pollution, trade and urbanization, as well as invasive species, will influence the effects of forest disturbances such as wildfires, droughts, storms, diseases and insect outbreaks, thus affecting the health and resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide. Tree endophytes can contribute to biological control of infectious diseases, enhance tolerance to environmental stress or behave as opportunistic weak pathogens potentially competing with more harmful ones. New molecular techniques are available for studying the complete tree endobiome under the influence of global change stressors from the landscape to the intercontinental level. Given that exotic tree diseases have both ecologic and economic consequences, we call for increased interdisciplinary collaboration in the coming decades between forest pathologists and researchers studying endophytes with tree geneticists, evolutionary and landscape ecologists, biogeographers, conservation biologists and global change scientists and outline interdisciplinary research gaps.

T1  - A game of cat-and-mouse: microhabitat influences rodent foraging in recently burnt but not long unburnt shrublands
AN  - 1702835192
AB  - We investigated the influence of vegetation structure and fire history on the foraging behavior of small rodents (Notomys mitchellii, Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, and Mus musculus) by conducting giving-up density (GUD) experiments in recently burnt (9-13 years since last fire) and long unburnt shrublands (> 40 years), and open and sheltered microhabitats, in a semiarid region of Western Australia. We predicted that rodents would spend less time foraging in recently burnt shrublands and open microhabitat and that the influence of microhabitat would be weaker in long unburnt compared to more recently burnt vegetation. Our findings show that fire history and microhabitat structure influence the foraging behavior of the study species and that the influence of microhabitat varies between fire histories. GUDs were higher in long unburnt vegetation and in open microhabitats. There was a microhabitat effect in recently burnt vegetation, but not in long unburnt. Rodents foraged more in sheltered microhabitats probably because predator encounters are less likely to occur there and it provides them with greater refuge from predation. The presence of a microhabitat effect in recently burnt, but not long unburnt vegetation suggests that understory vegetation density is more important in mediating predation risk than canopy density. Future studies of small mammal responses to land management actions should include behavioral, as well as population-level responses to differing fire regimes.

T1  - Effects of an extensive fire on arboreal small mammal populations in a neotropical savanna woodland
AN  - 1702835062
AB  - Fire is a major form of disturbance in terrestrial ecosystems, mainly in tropical savannas. In these ecosystems, the effects of large wildfires are potentially high on small and relatively less mobile animals, like small mammals. We investigated the effects of an extensive wildfire ([asymptotically =] 6,240 ha) in September 2011 on populations of 2 arboreal-scansorial small mammals-the gracile mouse opossum, Gracilinanus agilis, and the long-tailed climbing mouse, Rhipidomys macrurus-in 4 savanna woodland patches (1 burned, 3 unburned) of the highly threatened Brazilian Cerrado. We assessed population densities from 2009 to 2013 and for G. agilis, we estimated apparent survival and recapture probabilities with Cormack-Jolly-Seber models. Both species showed strong, negative fire responses, including sudden collapse and slow recovery (at least more than 1 year). These observed responses were probably a consequence of both the phytophysiognomic features of the habitat and severity of the fire with the resulting changes on the vertical structure of vegetation. The studied species of Cerrado forested formations were not as resilient to fire disturbance as typical species from savanna or temperate woodlands. As a consequence of human activities and climate changes, fire events are predicted to become larger and more frequent in the Brazilian Cerrado. Therefore, it is imperative to create new management strategies to protect forested physiognomies from fire, especially cerradão, which is very fire sensitive and has a limited and scattered distribution in the landscape.

T1  - Relationship between the abundance of the Endangered volcano rabbit Romerolagus diazi and vegetation structure in the Sierra Chichinautzin mountain range, Mexico
AN  - 1672113955
AB  - Abstract

              
The volcano rabbit Romerolagus diazi is endemic to the mountains of central Mexico, where its habitat has been gradually destroyed to make way for agriculture, ranching and logging, and by forest fires. The volcano rabbit is categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. We evaluated the relationship between the abundance of the volcano rabbit and vegetation structure at a small scale (0.25 ha). Using a general linear model we generated a set of 21 predictive models and proposed the best model as a habitat quality index. Our results suggest that greater height and cover of bunchgrasses and the presence of a shrub layer offer the volcano rabbit the best refuge from predators. The habitat quality index and the limited available habitat documented in our survey indicate that the populations of volcano rabbits in the study area are more threatened than previously thought. As R. diazi is a habitat specialist it does not have the option of moving to another habitat type.

T1  - Potential Effects of Climate Change on Florida's Everglades
AN  - 1668086744
AB  - Issue Title: Special Feature: Predicting Ecological Responses of the Florida Everglades to Possible Future Climate Scenarios

              
Restoration efforts in Florida's Everglades focus on preserving and restoring this unique wetland's natural landscape. Because most of the Everglades is a freshwater peatland, it requires surplus rainfall to remain a peatland. Restoration plans generally assume a stable climate, yet projections of altered climate over a 50-year time horizon suggest that this assumption may be inappropriate. Using a legacy regional hydrological model, we simulated combinations of a temperature rise of 1.5 °C, a ± 10 % change in rainfall, and a 0.46 m sea level rise relative to base conditions. The scenario of increased evapotranspiration and increased rainfall produced a slight increase in available water. In contrast, the more likely scenario of increased evapotranspiration and decreased rainfall lowered median water depths by 5-114 cm and shortened inundation duration periods by 5-45 %. Sea level rise increased stages and inundation duration in southern Everglades National Park. These ecologically significant decreases in water depths and inundation duration periods would greatly alter current ecosystems through severe droughts, peat loss and carbon emissions, wildfires, loss of the unique ridge and slough patterns, large shifts in plant and animal communities, and increased exotic species invasions. These results suggest using adaptive restoration planning, a method that explicitly incorporates large climatic and environmental uncertainties into long-term ecosystem restoration plans, structural design, and management. Anticipated water constraints necessitate alternative approaches to restoration, including maintaining critical landscapes and facilitating transitions in others. Accommodating these uncertainties may improve the likelihood of restoration success.

T1  - Land-use legacies and present fire regimes interact to mediate herbivory by altering the neighboring plant community
AN  - 1667885194
AB  - Past and present human activities, such as historic agriculture and fire suppression, are widespread and can create depauperate plant communities. Although many studies show that herbivory on focal plants depends on the density of herbivores or the composition of the surrounding plant community, it is unclear whether anthropogenic changes to plant communities alter herbivory. We tested the hypothesis that human activities that alter the plant community lead to subsequent changes in herbivory. At 20 sites distributed across 80 300 hectares, we conducted a field experiment that manipulated insect herbivore access (full exclosures and pseudo-exclosures) to four focal plant species in longleaf pine woodlands with different land-use histories (post-agricultural sites or non-agricultural sites) and degrees of fire frequency (frequent and infrequent). Plant cover, particularly herbaceous cover, was lower in post-agricultural and fire suppressed woodlands. Density of the dominant insect herbivore at our site (grasshoppers) was positively related to plant cover. Herbivore access reduced biomass of the palatable forb Solidago odora in frequently burned post-agricultural sites and in infrequently burned non-agricultural woodlands and increased mortality of another forb (Pityopsis graminifolia), but did not affect two other less palatable species (Schizachyrium scoparium and Tephrosia virginiana). Herbivory on S. odora exhibited a hump-shaped response to plant cover, with low herbivory at low and high levels of plant cover. Herbivore density had a weak negative effect on herbivory. These findings suggest that changes in plant cover related to past and present human activities can modify damage rates on focal S. odora plants by altering grasshopper foraging behavior rather than by altering local grasshopper density. The resulting changes in herbivory may have the potential to limit natural recovery or restoration efforts by reducing the establishment or performance of palatable plant species.

T1  - Large unburnt areas, not small unburnt patches, are needed to conserve avian diversity in fire-prone landscapes
AN  - 1665302255
AB  - Mitigating the impacts of large-scale fires on biodiversity is becoming increasingly important as their frequency increases. In response, fire managers have engaged with the concept that retaining small unburnt residual areas of vegetation within extensively burnt landscapes may facilitate biodiversity conservation. However, it remains uncertain how the size and isolation of these unburnt residuals influence faunal distributions, persistence and recovery following fire. We used a replicated observation study to test bird responses to the size and isolation of unburnt residuals in a mallee woodland area recently burnt by a 28 000 ha wildfire in southern Australia. The scale of our study provided a rare opportunity to consider the responses of large mobile organisms to fire-induced habitat fragmentation. Within five replicated spatial blocks, we crossed two levels of isolation with large (5-7 ha) and small (1-3 ha) unburnt patches and matrix sites burnt 5 years previously. We compared these site types to six continuous (non-fragmented) unburnt sites. We surveyed each site on eight occasions. Most birds occurred more frequently in unburnt habitat beyond the extent of the fire. Bird responses to the availability and spatial distribution of unburnt remnants within the fire were largely influenced by their ability to use the recently burnt matrix. Occurrence of five species was higher in unburnt residuals when more of the landscape within 500 m was burnt. A fire refuge effect may be likely for two competitive species that occurred more frequently in unburnt residuals than in the burnt matrix or continuous unburnt habitat. For the weebill, recolonization following fire was likely to occur gradually over time from ex situ sources. To maintain avian diversity in fire-prone landscapes, our results suggest a need to shift management focus from creating networks of small unburnt patches towards preserving large, intact areas of habitat. However, five species common to the burnt matrix preferentially selected residual patches when unburnt resources were locally scarce. Therefore, to benefit birds, land managers should limit the extent of applied burns and use narrow burns. When planning large burns, practitioners should consider that a number of species will remain absent from the landscape for several decades.

AB  - Reconstructing historical habitat could help reverse declining animal populations, but detailed, spatially comprehensive data are rare. For example, habitat for the federally threatened Northern spotted owl (NSO; Strix occidentalis caurina) was thought historically rare because low-severity fires kept forests open and habitat restricted to fire refugia, but spatial historical data are lacking.

              
Here I use public land-surveys to spatially reconstruct NSO habitat and old-growth forests in dry forests in Oregon's Eastern Cascades in the late-1800s. I used reconstructions of forest structure across about 280,000 ha, including 9,605 tree records and 2,180 section-line descriptions. I was able to reconstruct likely NSO nest trees, nest stands, and foraging and roosting habitat, based on modern NSO habitat studies.

              
Historical nest stands, including sufficient nest trees, were predicted across 22-39 % and foraging and roosting habitat across 11-68 % of the study area, thus neither were rare. More habitat than expected occurred in forests with preceding mixed-severity fires. Early post-fire succession produced foraging and roosting habitat. Mid- to late-succession produced nesting habitat. Late-succession after high-severity fires can also provide NSO habitat. Old-growth forests, covering 76 % of study-area forests, also likely link to preceding mixed-severity fires.

              
Mixed- and high-severity fires strongly shaped historical dry forests and produced important components of historical NSO habitat. Focus on short-term loss of nest sites and territories to these fires is mis-directed. Fuel treatments to reduce these natural fires, if successful, would reduce future habitat of the NSO in dry forests.

T1  - Modeling climate change, urbanization, and fire effects on Pinus palustris ecosystems of the southeastern U.S.
AN  - 1655311079
AB  - Managing ecosystems for resilience and sustainability requires understanding how they will respond to future anthropogenic drivers such as climate change and urbanization. In fire-dependent ecosystems, predicting this response requires a focus on how these drivers will impact fire regimes. Here, we use scenarios of climate change, urbanization and management to simulate the future dynamics of the critically endangered and fire-dependent longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. We investigated how climate change and urbanization will affect the ecosystem, and whether the two conservation goals of a 135% increase in total longleaf area and a doubling of fire-maintained open-canopy habitat can be achieved in the face of these drivers. Our results show that while climatic warming had little effect on the wildfire regime, and thus on longleaf pine dynamics, urban growth led to an 8% reduction in annual wildfire area. The management scenarios we tested increase the ecosystem's total extent by up to 62% and result in expansion of open-canopy longleaf by as much as 216%, meeting one of the two conservation goals for the ecosystem. We find that both conservation goals for this ecosystem, which is climate-resilient but vulnerable to urbanization, are only attainable if a greater focus is placed on restoration of non-longleaf areas as opposed to maintaining existing longleaf stands. Our approach demonstrates the importance of accounting for multiple relevant anthropogenic threats in an ecosystem-specific context in order to facilitate more effective management actions.

T1  - Effects of fire on small mammal communities in frequent-fire forests in California
AN  - 1702835214
AB  - Fire is a natural, dynamic process that is integral to maintaining ecosystem function. The reintroduction of fire (e.g., prescribed fire, managed wildfire) is a critical management tool for protecting many frequent-fire forests against stand-replacing fires while restoring an essential ecological process. Understanding the effects of fire on forests and wildlife communities is important in natural resource planning efforts. Small mammals are key components of forest food webs and essential to ecosystem function. To investigate the relationship of fire to small mammal assemblages, we live trapped small mammals in 10 burned and 10 unburned forests over 2 years in the central Sierra Nevada, California. Small mammal abundance was higher in unburned forests, largely reflecting the greater proportion of closed-canopy species such as Glaucomys sabrinus in unburned forests. The most abundant species across the entire study area was the highly adaptable generalist species, Peromyscus maniculatus. Species diversity was similar between burned and unburned forests, but burned forests were characterized by greater habitat heterogeneity and higher small mammal species evenness. The use and reintroduction of fire to maintain a matrix of burn severities, including large patches of unburned refugia, creates a heterogeneous and resilient landscape that allows for fire-sensitive species to proliferate and, as such, may help maintain key ecological functions and diverse small mammal assemblages.

T1  - Regeneration failure threatens persistence of Persoonia elliptica (Proteaceae) in Western Australian jarrah forests
AN  - 1647317270
AB  - The severe disruption of herbivore relationships can result in catastrophic, demographic consequences for plant populations. We investigated the potential roles of herbivory, fire and their interaction, in the observed long-term regeneration failure of Persoonia elliptica R.Br. (Proteaceae), an understory tree species of fire-prone jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Sm.) forests in southwestern Australia. Seed production, storage and viability were assessed, as was seedling recruitment in both the presence and absence of fire (a potential germination cue), using experimental herbivore exclosure plots. We also sought to determine the 'herbivory zone' (height) within which P. elliptica was susceptible to browsing. Herbivores, primarily the western grey kangaroo, preferentially consumed leaves of P. elliptica up to a browsing height of 1.5 m. Viability of fresh seeds was low at ca. 39 % and rapid viability loss was observed in the soil seed bank, with only ca. 5 % of seeds remaining viable for >1 year. Germination was restricted almost solely to burned areas and survival of recruits to the confines of herbivore exclosures. We suggest that an increase in the primary herbivore, combined with low viable seed supply, is the likely cause of continuing regeneration failure in this species. The slow growth of the species suggests that without intervention, seedlings and juvenile plants will be unable to escape the herbivory zone. Management actions to facilitate recruitment might best focus on the combination of managed fires to break seed dormancy, followed by fencing to protect seedlings from large herbivores.

T1  - Short-Term Impacts of Prescribed Burning on the Spider Community (Order: Araneae) in a Small Ohio Grassland
AN  - 1813593483
AB  - Prescribed burning is a management tool that is widely accepted for prairie management and restoration, yet little is known how burning may impact the spider community. Although it is generally thought that prescribed burning may alter the spider community composition and structure, few studies have examined these shifts in a controlled manner with both a burned grassland and a nearby unburned companion grassland. On 25 October 2014 we conducted a prescribed burn of a grassland at the Gwynne Conservation Area, London, Ohio. Spiders were sampled using pitfall traps for four weeks pre-burn and six weeks post-burn in both the treatment grassland and adjacent unburned grassland. A total of 298 spiders were collected from sixteen families, over 60 percent of which were in the family Lycosidae. Overall, we found the prescribed burn did not significantly alter the abundance or diversity of spiders collected, and interestingly it appears the community composition of the unburned grassland changed more over the sample period than the burned grassland. Anecdotal observations also suggest that some spiders are capable of surviving the fire in situ. As we continue to study these communities, we will develop a better understanding of the role that prescribed burning plays in regulating the structure and composition of the spider communities. Such information is important to develop process-based restoration and management practices in grassland ecosystems.

T1  - Fire Management and Carbon Sequestration in Pine Barren Forests
AN  - 1656360943
AB  - Prescribed burning is the major viable option that land managers have for reducing hazardous fuels and ensuring the regeneration of fire-dependent species in a cost-effective manner in Pine Barren ecosystems. Fuels management activities are directly linked to carbon (C) storage and rates of C sequestration by forests. To evaluate the effects of prescribed burning on forest C dynamics, we quantified consumption and accumulation of the forest floor and understory vegetation and measured net CO... exchange in upland forest stands in the New Jersey Pinelands burned with prescribed fires. Prescribed fires released an average of 470 ± 137 g C m... from the litter layer and understory, equivalent to approximately 2-3 yr of sequestered C in undisturbed upland forests. Canopy and understory foliage averaged 85% of preburn periods, and CO... uptake at near-full sunlight conditions averaged 79% of preburn levels during the following growing season. On an annual basis, stands lost C during the year of the burn, but released C was recovered within 2-3 yr. Field measurements and model simulations suggest that continued prescribed burning in upland fire-dependent pine-dominated stands would have little appreciable effect on long-term forest C dynamics at the landscape scale.

T1  - Fire in the Northeast: Learning from the Past, Planning for the Future
AN  - 1656360702
AB  - Fire is an important disturbance process that regulates forest stand structure and species diversity in many ecosystems across the northeastern United States. Fires have promoted the growth and regeneration of shade intolerant genera throughout the Holocene, during which time humans have had a dominant influence on northeastern fire regimes. Humans have used fire for many applications including wildlife management, land clearing, and vegetation maintenance. Fire frequency increased during the periods of Native American occupation and early European colonization, but it has decreased since Native American displacement, colonist farm abandonment, and direct fire suppression, causing shifts in plant community composition toward shade-tolerant, pyrophobic species. Managers need appropriate benchmarks for using prescribed fire for restoration, especially in the face of climatic change. Salient lessons from history are: (a) fire is natural, (b) fire is cultural, (c) fire is economic, and (d) human decisions regarding fire will strongly impact the future of existing ecosystems. Fire, and how we as a society will manage it, must remain at the forefront of political discussions, policy development, and public education, while investment into research must provide the knowledge base for continued adaptive management in the face of an uncertain future.

T1  - Forgotten role of fires in Central European forests: critical importance of early post-fire successional stages for bees and wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata)
AN  - 1641601299
AB  - Forest fire remains among the most controversial topics in nature conservation. Here, we address changes in abundance and species composition of the bee and wasp community following a temperate forest crown fire that led to nearly complete defoliation and dieback of trees within 2 years. We found a highly dynamic community of 252 bee and wasp species (representing 18.8 % of total bee and wasp species known from the Czech Republic) that utilized 1-7-year-old burned forest stands. Species richness in the burned forest stands was significantly higher than that recorded in nearby forest that had been unaffected by any recent fire. The unburned forest hosted only 88 species. We found 42 red-listed species, of which 40 were present in the burned forest, while only 12 were present in the control forest. Numerous early- and late-responding species were detected, but maximum species diversity was reached 3 years after the fire. Only 7 of the total of 261 species were limited to the forest that was unaffected by any recent fire. A management regime that supported the presence of bare sand and heather patches, and removal of all but solitary pine trees, was found to be insufficient to support the full spectrum of forest fire-dependent species. This was mainly due to the absence of charred or decaying dead wood, which is otherwise utilized by numerous red-listed cavity adopters that are absent in the surrounding cultural landscape. Retaining part of the charred trunks is suggested as a novel post-fire conservation measure.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using prescribed fire and herbicide to manage rank native warm season grass for northern bobwhite
AN  - 1637691065
AB  - Converting fields of exotic cool season grass to native warm season grass creates habitat for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). If converted stands are left unmanaged they can become rank, or over-vegetated and unsuitable for grassland wildlife. Northern bobwhite populations have been declining across their range for decades, and maximizing the amount of habitat is vital to increasing their abundance. We investigated prescribed burning followed by herbicide application as a management strategy to improve vegetative composition and structure for northern bobwhite in rank native warm season grass stands. Within 4 study areas using a randomized block design, we applied the following treatments: burn-only, burn then application of 27.7% isopropylamine salt of imazapyr (ISI), burn then application of 7.78% imazapyr 62.22% diuron mixture (imazapyr), and burn then 41% glyphosate application. We measured vegetative parameters related to structure and composition and compared these metrics between treatments using repeated measures analysis of variance blocked by sampling area. We compared grass stands to hypothetical optimum conditions for bobwhite using principle components analysis. The ISI treatment produced levels of forbs and native warm season grass beneficial to bobwhite throughout the study, and was initially most similar to optimum conditions. Glyphosate treatment also produced vegetation beneficial to bobwhite. Imazapyr produced beneficial levels of bare ground during the first growing season but none of our treatments produced beneficial levels after 2 growing seasons. Herbicide treatments initially had greater influence on habitat structure than did the burn-only treatment, but all habitat structure variables were similar among treatments after 2 growing seasons. Our results indicate that management of rank grasslands for northern bobwhite occurring at <2-year intervals provides near optimal levels of native warm season grass and forbs and has potential to create habitat structure. On private lands managed for northern bobwhite where landowners do not have access to disking, we recommend prescribed burning followed by either 2.81L/ha ISI or 5.62L/ha glyphosate application using a non-ionic surfactant followed by annual or biennial prescribed burning. We do not recommend the use of imazapyr or burn-only treatments when managing rank grasslands for northern bobwhite habitat because they do not create beneficial levels of native warm season grass or forbs. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Resistance and Resilience: A Conceptual Framework for Silviculture
AN  - 1650510881
AB  - Increasingly, forest management goals include building or maintaining resistance and/or resilience to disturbances in the face of climate change. Although a multitude of descriptive definitions for resistance and resilience exist, to evaluate whether specific management activities (silviculture) are effective, prescriptive characterizations are necessary. We introduce a conceptual framework that explicitly differentiates resistance and resilience, denotes appropriate scales, and establishes the context for evaluation-structure and composition. Generally, resistance is characterized as the influence of structure and composition on disturbance, whereas resilience is characterized as the influence of disturbance on subsequent structure and composition. Silvicultural utility of the framework is demonstrated by describing disturbance-specific, time-bound structural and compositional objectives for building resistance and resilience to two fundamentally different disturbances: wildfires and spruce beetle outbreaks. The conceptual framework revealed the crucial insight that attempts to build stand or landscape resistance to spruce beetle outbreaks will ultimately be unsuccessful. This frees the silviculturist to focus on realistic goals associated with building resilience to likely inevitable outbreaks. Ultimately, because structure and composition, at appropriate scales, are presented as the standards for evaluation and manipulation, the framework is broadly applicable to many kinds of disturbance in various forest types.

T1  - Five-year legacy of wildfire and salvage logging impacts on nutrient runoff and aquatic plant, invertebrate, and fish productivity
AN  - 1630215681
AB  - Ecohydrological linkages between phosphorus (P) production, stream algae, benthic invertebrate, and fish communities were studied for 4years after severe wildfire in the Rocky Mountains (Alberta, Canada). Mean concentrations of all forms of P (soluble reactive, total dissolved, particulate, and total) were 2 to 13 times greater in burned and post-fire salvage-logged streams than in unburned streams (p<0.001). Post-disturbance recovery of P was slow with differences in P-discharge relationships still evident 5years after the fire (p<0.001). Coupled P and sediment interactions were likely responsible for slow recovery of P regimes in fire-disturbed watersheds. P loading was associated with strong ecological responses in stream biota. Annual algal productivity was 5 to 71 times greater in streams within burned watersheds than in reference watersheds and persisted for 5years after the fire (p<0.001). Elevated algal production was associated with strong differences in benthic invertebrate community structure, including greater invertebrate densities, biomass, species diversity, and shifts in species composition. Monotonic shifts in invertebrate stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios indicated increased consumption of autochthonous food sources and effects on energy pathways for invertebrates from fire-affected streams. Wildfire-related changes at lower trophic lead to increases in size (weight and length) and growth rate (weight:age ratios) of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). This cascading series of effects of wildfire on stream productivity (primary production, secondary invertebrate consumers, and fish) may be long-lived legacies of wildfire because of the slow recovery of P regimes.

T1  - Vegetation Management Across Colorado Plateau BLM Lands: 1950-2003
AN  - 1629702973
AB  - Large tracts of land across the western United States have been managed over the last century in an effort to increase forage production, reduce the risk of wildland fires, and/or restore ecosystem structure and function. Yet documentation of this land-treatment history is lacking. With the use of data collected from Bureau of Land Management (BLM) field offices across the Colorado Plateau, we quantified the number, spatial extent, and implementation cost of tree-reduction and seeding treatments done in piñon (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma, Juniperus monophylla, Juniperus scopulorum) woodlands between 1950 and 2003. Over 247 000 hectares of land were treated, corresponding to 6.6% of the pi non-juniper vegetation type within BLM-owned lands. Tree-reduction treatments involving chaining, bulldozing, or cabling were most prevalent between the 1950s and 1970s, with over 163 000 ha of land treated with these methods. Prescribed burning became increasingly prevalent in the 1980s, with over 43 000 ha burned. In more recent years, hydroaxe treatments have become common (4 400 ha treated), but to a much lesser extent than prescribed burns. Over 60% of these tree-reduction treatments were done in conjunction with revegetation or seeding treatments. Implementation costs of these tree-reduction treatments were over $26.7 million, with the hydroaxe treatment having nearly three times the cost of implementation than all other tree-reduction treatments. The spatial extent of these tree-reduction treatments and associated implementation costs highlight the importance of research examining the efficacy of these treatments and the potential legacy effects. The land-use history reported in this study and the accompanying freely accessible on-line database is a useful tool to guide research and management objectives and methodology.

T1  - Effects of Climate Variability and Accelerated Forest Thinning on Watershed-Scale Runoff in Southwestern USA Ponderosa Pine Forests
AN  - 2014728242
AB  - The recent mortality of up to 20% of forests and woodlands in the southwestern United States, along with declining stream flows and projected future water shortages, heightens the need to understand how management practices can enhance forest resilience and functioning under unprecedented scales of drought and wildfire. To address this challenge, a combination of mechanical thinning and fire treatments are planned for 238,000 hectares (588,000 acres) of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests across central Arizona, USA. Mechanical thinning can increase runoff at fine scales, as well as reduce fire risk and tree water stress during drought, but the effects of this practice have not been studied at scales commensurate with recent forest disturbances or under a highly variable climate. Modifying a historical runoff model, we constructed scenarios to estimate increases in runoff from thinning ponderosa pine at the landscape and watershed scales based on driving variables: pace, extent and intensity of forest treatments and variability in winter precipitation. We found that runoff on thinned forests was about 20% greater than unthinned forests, regardless of whether treatments occurred in a drought or pluvial period. The magnitude of this increase is similar to observed declines in snowpack for the region, suggesting that accelerated thinning may lessen runoff losses due to warming effects. Gains in runoff were temporary (six years after treatment) and modest when compared to mean annual runoff from the study watersheds (0–3%). Nonetheless gains observed during drought periods could play a role in augmenting river flows on a seasonal basis, improving conditions for water-dependent natural resources, as well as benefit water supplies for downstream communities. Results of this study and others suggest that accelerated forest thinning at large scales could improve the water balance and resilience of forests and sustain the ecosystem services they provide.

T1  - Effects of plantation residue management on the community structure of wattle regeneration invertebrate pests in South Africa
AN  - 1617316468
AB  - There is a limited availability of land for the expansion of South African black wattle plantations. One way to increase productivity is to ensure the survival of seedlings during regeneration, thereby increasing the stocking of compartments. Soil invertebrate pests constitute one of the important causes of seedling mortality. The effect of different plantation residue management practices on the incidence of these pests was unknown. Fourteen trials were planted on previous wattle sites over six growing seasons. Seven different plantation residue management regimes (windrowed-burnt-weeded, windrowed-burnt-ripped, fallow [mowed or manually weeded], windrowed-burnt-old arable, windrowed-burnt-closer spacing, and windrowed-broadcast-herbicide) were appraised using multivariate analysis. Seedlings were evaluated monthly after planting for a period of six months. Stressed, damaged and dead seedlings were uprooted and inspected to determine the cause of death. Members of the soil invertebrate pest complex included whitegrubs and cutworms that generally had a higher pest status than millipedes, nematodes, grasshoppers, ants, false wireworms, termites and crickets. A higher incidence (1.44%) of cutworm damage was observed in the windrowed-burnt-ripped and fallow sites. However, there was a greater infestation of soil invertebrate pests on sites where the plantation residue was windrowed-burnt-weeded or 'broadcast' (20.34%) than in the other treatments (windrowed-burnt-ripped or fallow; 2.36%). The addition of a rip treatment to a depth of about 50 cm in the windrow and burn regime significantly reduced the infestation of soil invertebrate pests, especially whitegrubs. Seedlings that were planted at a closer spacing in windrowed and burnt sites also had a lower incidence of soil invertebrate pest damage (7.79%). Regeneration of an old arable site in Seven Oaks had a sporadically high incidence of nematodes (11.58%). These findings have important management implications because windrow and burn are frequent plantation residue management practices in wattle silviculture. Insecticide application is the alternative option, although its use is restricted by Forest Stewardship Council guidelines.

T1  - To Burn or Not to Burn? Effect of Management Strategy on North American Prairie Vegetation for Public Urban Areas in Germany
AN  - 1604506054
AB  - North American prairie vegetation has been a role model for designing highly attractive plantings for German urban green spaces for the past decade. In combination with gravel mulch top layers on planting sites and non-selective maintenance techniques like mowing or burning, prairie plantings are considered to be cost-effective and low-maintenance. This study was undertaken to assess the impact of different maintenance strategies and especially the necessity of fire management on the development success of ornamental prairie plantings in central Europe. A four factorial split-plot-block design was set up for investigation of different mixtures of prairie species under varying management conditions (mow-only, mowing plus selective weeding, mowing plus weeding and burning) on two differing soil types (in-situ topsoil and in-situ topsoil with a graywacke gravel mulch top layer) over three years. Significant effects of maintenance strategy on mortality rates and vitality were documented for a number of target species, which responded species specifically, either being slightly affected by the burning or thriving on it. Those effects were mostly restricted to topsoil sites. A strong impact on weed species presence and abundance and resulting maintenance times was found on both soil types. On topsoil sites, mow-only treatment resulted in a short-term loss of the original planting due to extensive weed growth. Corresponding gravel mulch sites were generally less colonised and visually dominated by weeds. Differences between weeded and weeded plus burned sites were minor. Unexpectedly, weed species populations were mostly unaffected by the additional burning treatment, while maintenance times and costs increased. No overall benefit of fire management for the establishment of prairie plantings was documented. The most effective management combination proved to be mowing plus regular selective weeding measures on gravel mulched planting sites.

T1  - Bark Beetle Demography in a Jeffrey Pine Stand as Influenced by Mechanized Thinning and Prescribed Fire
AN  - 1549931224
AB  - Forest thinnings implemented with cut-to-length and whole-tree harvesting systems followed by underburning were evaluated for their effects on bark beetle prevalence in pure, uneven-aged Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) interspersed with isolated California white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana [Gord.] Lemm.). Based on pitch tube counts in a stand with a moderate bark beetle population in its pine component, the Jeffrey pine beetle (Dendroctonus jeffreyi Hopkins) generally preferred larger trees before treatment implementation, but after exhibiting mixed pretreatment tendencies concerning stand density demonstrated a posttreatment proclivity toward higher density. Cut-to-length thinning followed by underburning increased the pine beetle population while whole-tree thinning unaccompanied by burning reduced it. Tree mortality was induced by the bark beetle infestation but was not its sole cause. Pitch tube abundance on white fir far exceeded that on Jeffrey pine, and the greatest influence on the fir engraver (Scolytus ventralis LeConte) population was the prevalence of its host tree. The responses presented herein to these thinning and burning practices, which are being increasingly utilized in forest restoration efforts in the western USA, provide natural resource managers insight into potential forest health outcomes when implemented in Jeffrey pine and similar dry site forest types.

T1  - Proactive Restoration: Planning, Implementation, and Early Results of Silvicultural Strategies for Increasing Resilience against Gypsy Moth Infestation in Upland Oak Forests on the Daniel Boone National Forest, Kentucky
AN  - 1562002728
AB  - Determining targets in forest restoration is a complicated task that can be facilitated by cooperative partnerships. Too often restoration plans are implemented after adverse events that cause widespread tree mortality, such as drought or insect outbreaks, have occurred. Reactive management precludes the use of preemptive management techniques that can result in more effective restoration. The potential recognition and risks associated with a large-scale mortality event cultivated a proactive partnership among managers, stakeholders, and researchers on the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky. This partnership resulted in the development of innovative proactive approaches to mitigate the negative impacts of threat of declining forest health, thus reducing the need for untested and expensive postdisturbance restorative operations. The partnership comprised four Research Work Units in the USDA Forest Service (including the Northern and Southern Research Stations), three universities (one land grant and two liberal arts), two natural resource state agencies, private logging contractors, an electrical utility, and National Forest system personnel at the district, forest supervisor, and Washington office levels. We tested forest management prescriptions designed to meet targets for future forest conditions. The goal of the silviculture treatments was to improve forest health and productivity to increase resilience to and/or avoidance of exotic invasive insect defoliation and oak decline. Treatments varied from high levels of disturbance to low levels of disturbance and ranged from even-aged regeneration treatments coupled with prescribed burning to thinning. Research assessed the alteration in species composition and stand structure, the projected regeneration outcomes and the costs and operational efficacy of mechanized forest operations used to implement the treatments. The relatively large scale of the study and diversity of treatments has afforded additional multidisciplinary research activities. Via partnership building and information and technology sharing, this project has been sustained for 10 years.

T1  - Seedling Ecology and Restoration of Blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) in the Mojave Desert, United States
AN  - 1560555501
AB  - Increases in fire frequency are disrupting many ecological communities not historically subjected to fire. In the southwestern United States, the blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) community is among the most threatened, often replaced by invasive annual grasses after fire. This long-lived shrub is vulnerable because it recruits sporadically, partially due to mast seeding and the absence of a seed bank. The goal of this study was to evaluate if shrub restoration can be enhanced by identifying and ameliorating recruitment limitations. Specifically, we tested the effect of encapsulating seeds in predation-deterring "seed balls." We also tested the effects of nurse plants and mammalian exclusion cages on seedling emergence, growth, and survivorship. These experiments were conducted in a full-factorial design across three sites differing in elevation. Over 2years, 13% of all planted seeds emerged and the effect of seed balls was overwhelmingly negative because of low emergence. Nurse plants had overall positive effects at Low Elevation, but negative effects at Mid- and High Elevation. Emergence and survival were highest in caged plots everywhere, and effect sizes increased with elevation. Interactions between the cage and the nurse plant treatments indicated that nurse plants tended to attract mammalian predators, lowering emergence and seedling survivorship, particularly at higher elevations. Findings conform to the stress-gradient hypothesis in that interactions among seedlings and mature plants shifted from facilitation to competition as environmental stress decreased with increasing elevation, suggesting that they are transferable to ecologically similar communities elsewhere. Knowledge of site-specific recruitment limitations can help minimize ineffective restoration efforts.

T1  - Habitat fragmentation reduces occupancy of nest boxes by an open-country raptor
AN  - 1560277717
AB  - Summary              Despite the recent rapid decline of many grassland bird species, the relative importance of habitat configuration to population persistence is unclear. We used Southeastern American Kestrels Falco sparverius paulus in north-central Florida as a model system to explore the relative influence of landscape structure components on site occupancy patterns at two spatial scales, and for two different time periods. We focused on the dynamic processes of site-level population expansion or contraction. We modelled the occupancy of 131 American Kestrel nest boxes with Bayesian state-space dynamic occupancy models that considered both the partially observed process of true occupancy and the probability of detection of occupancy. We used reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithms to identify variables that described the continued occupancy of nest boxes, or [varphi], and the probability of colonisation of nest boxes between time periods, or [gamma]3. Changes in open habitat patch isolation at a fine scale, as estimated by the variability of nearest neighbour distance, predicted site colonisation between decades, and patch shape variability was related to [varphi] during the early time period (1992-93). We found no strong effects of landscape structure on [varphi] during the later time period (2008-2010). We also found no evidence for effects of loss of open habitat on box occupancy or colonization. Our results indicate that continued habitat fragmentation would be deleterious for this threatened subspecies. Additionally, certain land cover management practices recommended for the Florida sandhills, such as frequent low-intensity controlled burns, will likely help conservation attempts.

T1  - The Human Robber Hypothesis
AN  - 1560326544
AB  - Bipedalism paved the way to delivery of immature babies and development of the brain after birth. This communication presents the argument that hairlessness allowed hominins to access fire through wildfires, which occurred frequently after a climate shift from a wet to a dry environment 2.5 million years ago (Ma). Initially, naked hominins approached fire for warming, but soon must have come across burnt animals in the aftermath of wildfires. They learned the taste of burnt meat, which must have been a driving force compelling them to become meat-eaters. Hominins must have learned gradually how to control fire and how to repel hairy animals that abhor fire. Because they could neither run fast nor have muscles sufficiently strong to compete with large carnivores' fangs and claws, they chose not to be hunters but robbers. When they found that a carnivore had killed a prey animal, they approached the hungry predator and repulsed it using fire and stones, then claiming the prey intact. This is the core of the human robber hypothesis. The timing of global cooling, the appearance of savannahs, the appearance of transitional humans, decline of large predators, the manufacture of stone tools, and the start of cooking largely coincide at 2.5 Ma. They also smoked out animals from their dens or caves, and robbed them of shelter and territory. Cooked meat is both tasty and easily digested, providing hominins with rich nutrients sufficient to enlarge the brain, while most large carnivores were forced to extinction. Consequently, the use of fire, facilitated by hairlessness, must have played important roles in protecting hominins from cold, in repelling predators, in robbing large carnivores of prey and dwellings, and in providing the brain with nutrients for strong growth into adolescence. Development of the eccrine glands is also discussed as a result of hairlessness.

T1  - Gopher Tortoise Ecology in Coastal Upland and Beach Dune Habitats in Northeast Florida
AN  - 1551139617
AB  - Considered a keystone species in the southeastern US coastal plain, gopher tortoises occupy a variety of upland habitat types. Although upland pine-dominated habitats have received much attention, few studies have examined tortoises in nearby coastal beach dune habitats. To examine the distribution and abundance of gopher tortoises in northeast Florida coastal habitats, comprehensive burrow surveys were conducted 3 times during the last 8 yrs on 2 separate gopher tortoise populations near St. Augustine, Florida. The objectives for these surveys were to 1) examine changes in population size and structure in representative upland and coastal dune habitats and 2) describe the response of gopher tortoises to land management practices (i.e., prescribed fire). Total burrow density within the upland population remained stable over the 3 surveys (0.68 burrows/ha in 2005, 0.66 burrows/ha in 2007, and 0.64 burrows/ha in 2011). Burrow densities in the burned areas of the upland habitat increased in areas that were burned at least once since the time of the first survey in 2005 but decreased in areas that were infrequently burned or remained unburned. Burrow density on the beach dunes, however, greatly increased between the most recent 2 surveys (3.63 burrows/ha in 2007 and 8.95 burrows/ha in 2011), possibly attributable to an increased use of a relatively confined habitat, or sampling biases by surveyors. Three different correction factor methods were used to determine gopher tortoise population estimates for each of the surveys, providing a range of estimates. The results of this study and the few others focused on coastal beach dunes suggest that this vulnerable, yet important, habitat should receive more attention because some of the highest gopher tortoise burrow densities have been observed there.

T1  - Aquatic faunal responses to an induced regime shift in the phosphorus-impacted Everglades
AN  - 1530887947
AB  - Summary

              
Wetland eutrophication increases the susceptibility of native communities to invasion by opportunistic plant species, which then commonly form monotypic stands. Wetland aquatic fauna are negatively affected by associated changes of eutrophication in the physiochemical environment, habitat structural complexity and ecological interactions. In addition to reducing external nutrient loads, it is predicted that efforts that reduce the resilience of the altered ecosystem are required to accelerate ecosystem recovery.

              
We assessed small fish and decapod crustacean responses to a 3-year ecosystem scale experiment that tested the effectiveness of chemical treatment and controlled burning as a management strategy to accelerate the recovery of eutrophic Everglades marsh. The management strategy resulted in the removal, on average, of 91% and 81% of the emergent macrophyte cover in two regions differing in enrichment effects. The resulting open-water habitats were characterised by higher dissolved oxygen concentrations, greater periphyton and submersed aquatic vegetation and increased structural complexity.

              
The average combined density and biomass of small fish and decapod crustaceans did not differ significantly between dense emergent vegetation and created openings but regional and water year differences occurred. More importantly, community composition did differ between treatments, with the crayfish Procambarus fallax dominating in dense vegetation and small fish Gambusia holbrooki, Jordanella floridae and Poecilia latipinna and grass shrimp Palaemonetes paludosus dominating in open water.

              
We compared the whole body carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contents (%) and C:N:P stoichiometry among small fish and decapod crustaceans. Fish had greater whole body C and P contents (low C:P) compared with the two crustaceans. While the management action did not alter the quantity (mg carbon m-2) or energy (kcal m-2) of fauna, the resultant shift in composition was coincident with an increase in the nutrient quality (mg P m-2 and low C:P) of fauna.

              
Faunal community composition of the created open-water habitats in the eutrophic Everglades was similar to the oligotrophic Everglades; however, density and biomass were significantly lower for the oligotrophic region. Moreover, intraspecific comparisons showed that small fish and decapod crustaceans from the oligotrophic region were smaller and had lower whole body phosphorus contents than organisms from eutrophic regions. This suggests that phosphorus limitation in the Everglades extends beyond autotrophs to include consumers.

              
The high density of emergent macrophytes typically formed in eutrophic wetlands creates a physical barrier to predators, limiting the trophic transfer of energy. The combination of burning and chemical treatment not only maintained the abundance and biomass of aquatic fauna, but produced a compositional shift towards higher quality prey for wading birds and predatory fishes. We recognise that the contrasting nature between the created openings in the eutrophic and oligotrophic Everglades highlights major structural and functional differences in natural sloughs versus enriched created 'sloughs', but we suggest that active management efforts to accelerate the recovery of P-impacted regions could provide temporary benefits to Everglades wildlife by improving access to abundant, high-quality prey.

T1  - Ecological Consequences of Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks for Wildlife in Western North American Forests
AN  - 1558844665
AB  - Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) (MPB) outbreaks are increasingly prevalent in western North America, causing considerable ecological change in pine (Pinus spp.) forests with important implications for wildlife. We reviewed studies examining wildlife responses to MPB outbreaks and postoutbreak salvage logging to inform forest management and guide future research. Our review included 16 studies describing MPB outbreak relationships with 89 bird species and 6 studies describing relationships with 11 mammalian species, but no studies of reptiles or amphibians. We included studies that compared wildlife response metrics temporally (before versus after the outbreak) and spatially (across sites that varied in severity of outbreak) in relation to beetle outbreaks. Outbreaks ranged in size from 20,600 to ≥10^sup 7^ ha and studies occurred 1-30 years after the peak MPB outbreak, but most studies were conducted over the short-term (i.e., ≤6 years after the peak of MPB-induced tree mortality). Birds were the only taxa studied frequently; however, high variability existed among those studies to allow many inferences, although some patterns were evident. Avian studies concluded that cavity-nesting species responded more favorably to beetle-killed forests than species with open-cup nests, and species nesting in the shrub layer favored outbreak forests compared with ground and open-cup canopy nesters that generally showed mixed relationships. Bark-drilling species as a group clearly demonstrated a positive short-term association with MPB epidemics compared with that of other foraging assemblages. Cavity-nesting birds that do not consume bark beetles (i.e., secondary cavity-nesting species and nonbark-drilling woodpeckers) also exhibited some positive responses to MPB outbreaks, although not as pronounced or consistent as those of bark-drilling woodpeckers. Mammalian responses to MPB outbreaks were mixed. Studies consistently reported negative effects of MPB outbreaks on red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). However, there is evidence that red squirrels can persist after an outbreak under some conditions, e.g., when nonhost tree species are present. For small mammal species associated with forest understories, responses may be most pronounced during the postepidemic period (>6 years after the peak of beetle-induced tree mortality) when snags fall to produce coarse woody debris. Postoutbreak salvage logging studies (n = 6) reported results that lacked consensus. Postoutbreak salvage logging may have an impact on fewer wildlife species than postfire salvage logging, probably because only host-specific tree species are removed after beetle outbreaks.

T1  - Home range size and habitat selection of reintroduced Sylvilagus bachmani riparius
AN  - 1545530587
AB  - Effective restoration of threatened or endangered species requires understanding of basic ecological requirements such as habitat selection and home range needs. The endangered riparian brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani riparius) occupies areas of dense, brushy cover along streamside communities in the San Joaquin Valley of California, but over 93% of this habitat has been lost to urban and agricultural development. We released over 325 captive-born rabbits at the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) between July 2002 and July 2005, and we monitored 312 of these rabbits via radiotelemetry to assess spatial and habitat selection. Home ranges and core areas were similar among males and females, and were larger in the breeding season than during the nonbreeding season. Perhaps reflecting a growing population, home range estimates decreased in size over the duration of the study. Animals moved in response to a wildfire in July 2004, but home range area was similar in 90-day pre- and postfire periods. Of 1,143 possible dyads, 534 (47%) exhibited a mean of 86% overlap in 95% fixed-kernel home ranges. Overlap did not differ by dyad type (e.g., male-male), but was greater in nonbreeding than in breeding seasons; unlike home ranges, we did not detect any temporal changes in overlap as might be expected in a growing population. Riparian brush rabbits exhibit scale-independent habitat selection, disproportionately favoring thick understory cover such as sandbar willow mixed with dense shrubs (blackberry, roses). Refuge managers have promoted escape cover and flood refugia at strategic locations throughout the Refuge; our results concur that these are important habitat elements in the niche of riparian brush rabbits.

T1  - Persisting in a windy habitat: population ecology and behavioral adaptations of two endemic grasshopper species in the Cape region (South Africa)
AN  - 1542827814
AB  - Global biodiversity hotspots are rich in endemic insect species, many of which are threatened by the ongoing anthropogenic pressures on their habitats. The Cape region (South Africa) is one of these biodiversity hotspots, maintaining a high number of endemics. However, the ecology of most insect species in this region remains poorly understood. The two Orthoptera species Betiscoides meridionalis and Betiscoides parva are endemic to the Cape region and specialized on restio vegetation. They are threatened by increasing wildfire frequencies and invasions of non-native plant species. However, this information has been inferred from habitat changes, whereas no ecological study on these species has been conducted since they have been described. In order to facilitate conservation management, information on the ecology of these species is urgently required. The aim of our study was (1) to obtain data on the population ecology (particularly population sizes and mobility), and (2) to study the behavior of both species in response to environmental factors. For this purpose a mark-recapture-study and an observational behavior study were conducted. Both species had small population sizes and a low mobility with males moving greater distances than females. Wind had a strong influence on the behavior of Betiscoides, particularly on the small males of B. parva. Future studies might thus focus on the question whether wind-exposure is a critical factor for habitat choice of this species. We strongly recommend enhancing the connectivity of restio habitats and restoring these habitats to prevent extinction of specialized insect species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evidence of Climate-Induced Range Contractions in Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus in a Rocky Mountain Watershed, U.S.A
AN  - 1532652918
AB  - Many freshwater fish species are considered vulnerable to stream temperature warming associated with climate change because they are ectothermic, yet there are surprisingly few studies documenting changes in distributions. Streams and rivers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains have been warming for several decades. At the same time these systems have been experiencing an increase in the severity and frequency of wildfires, which often results in habitat changes including increased water temperatures. We resampled 74 sites across a Rocky Mountain watershed 17 to 20 years after initial samples to determine whether there were trends in bull trout occurrence associated with temperature, wildfire, or other habitat variables. We found that site abandonment probabilities (0.36) were significantly higher than colonization probabilities (0.13), which indicated a reduction in the number of occupied sites. Site abandonment probabilities were greater at low elevations with warm temperatures. Other covariates, such as the presence of wildfire, nonnative brook trout, proximity to areas with many adults, and various stream habitat descriptors, were not associated with changes in probability of occupancy. Higher abandonment probabilities at low elevation for bull trout provide initial evidence validating the predictions made by bioclimatic models that bull trout populations will retreat to higher, cooler thermal refuges as water temperatures increase. The geographic breadth of these declines across the region is unknown but the approach of revisiting historical sites using an occupancy framework provides a useful template for additional assessments.

T1  - Structural heterogeneity increases diversity of non‐breeding grassland birds
AN  - 2299132542
AB  - Grassland birds have experienced greater population declines than any other guild of birds in North America, and yet we know little about habitat use and the affects of management during their non‐breeding period on wintering grounds. The paucity of information on wintering grassland birds limits our ability to develop effective conservation strategies. We investigated habitat use by the winter bird community in grasslands with restored heterogeneity resulting from the interactive effects of fire and grazing. We used 500 m line transects distributed across patches (i.e., <13, 13–24, and >24 months post disturbance) resulting from spring burning with growing season grazing (April‐Sept) and quantified avian relative abundance, community structure, and probability of patch occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection. Grassland structure that resulted from the fire‐grazing interaction created heterogeneity among patches that influenced avian habitat use during winter. Generalist birds such as the Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were relatively common in all patch types while more specialized species such as the Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) and Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) reached greatest abundance and probability of occupancy in the patches with the least and greatest time post disturbance, respectively. This research provides novel information on the response of wintering birds to restored ecological processes in grasslands and can improve efforts to create effective conservation strategies. Our findings add to a growing body of literature supporting the use of fire and grazing to create a shifting grassland mosaic that increases vegetation structural and compositional heterogeneity and maximizes native biodiversity within rangeland ecosystems through the conservation of natural patterns and processes.

T1  - Assessing Greater Sage-Grouse Breeding Habitat With Aerial and Ground Imagery
AN  - 1541488319
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, wildfires, and weedy-plant invasions have destroyed and fragmented many sagebrush (Artemisia L. spp.) habitats. Sagebrush-dependent species like greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are vulnerable to these changes, making habitat monitoring essential to effective management. Conventional ground inventory methods are time consuming (expensive) and have lower data collection potentials than remote sensing. Our study evaluated the feasibility of ground (0.3-mm ground surface distance [GSD]) and aerial imagery (primarily, 1-mm GSD) to assess ground cover for big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) and other vegetation functional groups important in sage-grouse breeding habitat (lekking, nesting, and brood rearing). We surveyed ~526 km^sup 2^ of the upper Powder River watershed in Natrona County, Wyoming, USA, a region dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) communities interspersed with narrow riparian corridors. Our study area was used year-round by sage-grouse and included 16 leks. In June 2010, we acquired aerial images (1-mm resolution) for 3 228 systematic sampling locations; additional images were acquired as rapid-succession bursts where aerial transects crossed riparian areas and for 39 riparian and 39 upland ground locations (0.3-mm resolution) within 3.2-km of leks. We used SamplePoint software to quantify cover for plant taxa and functional groups using all ground images and a systematic sampling of aerial images. Canopy cover of sage-grouse food forbs-as averaged across aerial and ground imagery around all leks-was 1.8% and 7.8% in riparian and 0.5% and 4.0% in upland areas, respectively. Big sagebrush cover was 8.7% from upland aerial images and 9.4% from upland ground images. Aerial and ground imagery provided similar values for bare ground and shrubs in riparian and upland areas, whereas ground imagery provided finer-scale herbaceous-cover data that complemented the aerial imagery. These and other image-derived archival data provide a practical basis for landscape-scale management and are a cost-effective means for monitoring extensive sagebrush habitats.

T1  - Ecology and long-term history of fire in New Zealand
AN  - 1528102805
AB  - Fire is a complex physical and ecological process and one that has dramatically affected New Zealand's landscapes and ecosystems in the post-settlement era. Prior to human settlement in the late 13th century, the Holocene palaeoenvironmental record suggests that fire frequencies were low across most of New Zealand, with the notable exception of some wetland systems. Because few of New Zealand's indigenous plant species show any real adaptation to fire, the greatly increased fire activity that accompanied human settlement resulted in widespread, and in some cases permanent, shifts in the composition, structure and function of many terrestrial ecosystems. The combined effects of Maori and European fire have left long-lasting legacies in New Zealand's landscapes with the most obvious being the reduction of forest cover from 85-90% to 25% of the land area. Here we review the long-term ecological history of fire in New Zealand's terrestrial ecosystems and describe what is known about the fire ecology of New Zealand's plant species and communities, highlighting key uncertainties and areas where future research is required. While considerable emphasis has been placed on describing and understanding the 'initial burning period' that accompanied Maori arrival, much less ecological emphasis has been placed on the shifts in fire regime that occurred during the European period, despite the significant effects these had. Post-fire successional trajectories have been described for a number of wetland and forest communities in New Zealand, but in contemporary landscapes are complicated by the effects of exotic mammalian species that act as seed and seedling predators and herbivores, reduced pollination and dispersal services due to declines in the avifauna, and the presence of pyrophyllic exotic plant species. Many invasive plant species (e.g. Pinus spp., Acacia spp., Hakea spp., Ulex europaeus) are favoured by fire and now co-occur with indigenous plant species in communities whose long-term composition and trajectory are unclear. On the other hand, some highly-valued ecosystems such as tussock grasslands may require recurrent fire for their long-term persistence. Combined, the direct and indirect effects of the introduction of anthropic fire to New Zealand may have shifted large areas into successional 'traps' from which, in the face of recurrent fire, escape is difficult. Developing appropriate management strategies in such a context requires a nuanced understanding of the place of fire in New Zealand's ecosystems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Is Pile Seeding Wyoming Big Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis) an Effective Alternative to Broadcast Seeding?
AN  - 1527297386
AB  - Sagebrush plays an important role in the ecological functions of sagebrush steppe plant communities and is a necessary component of habitat for a variety of wildlife including greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). At lower elevations, increased fire frequency associated with exotic annual grass invasion has heightened the need for effective sagebrush restoration strategies, but existing techniques have been largely ineffective. Our objective was to evaluate "pile seeding" (placing mature seed heads on the ground) of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis) as an alternative to broadcast seeding. We used a randomized block design (n=5) replicated in 2 yr at two contrasting ecological sites in southeastern Oregon. Treatments applied to 10031.5 m plots included 1) pile seeding (four mature seed heads . pile^sup -1^×10 piles . plot^sup -1^), 2) broadcast seeding (0.5 kg pure live seed [PLS] . ha^sup -1^), and 3) natural recovery (i.e., nonseeded). Planting occurred in fall 2008 and 2009, and plots were monitored for seedling establishment for three or two growing seasons postplanting. Seedling density was estimated at the plot scale within a 50-cm radius of each seed head pile ("island scale"). In the year following planting, sagebrush seedling density at the plot scale was up to 60-fold higher (P≤0.05) in pile-seeded plots compared to natural recovery and broadcast plots. Seedling mortality was high (up to 98% reduction in density) for pile-seeded plots between the first and second growing seasons postplanting and differences between broadcast and pile-seeded plots dissipated by 2-3 yr postplanting. Although pile-seeding had higher initial density than broadcast seeding, neither technique had sufficient multiyear survival to suggest restoration efficacy at the plot scale. Seedling density at the island scale suggests that pile-seeding may be useful for establishing sagebrush islands, depending on year conditions. Research is needed to determine strategies capable of increasing long-term sagebrush seedling survival. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mountain plover nest survival in relation to prairie dog and fire dynamics in shortgrass steppe
AN  - 1518667399
AB  - Disturbed xeric grasslands with short, sparse vegetation provide breeding habitat for mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) across the western Great Plains. Maintaining local disturbance regimes through prairie dog conservation and prescribed fire may contribute to the sustainability of recently declining mountain plover populations, but these management approaches can be controversial. We estimated habitat-specific mountain plover densities and nest survival rates on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies and burns in the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Mountain plover densities were similar on prairie dog colonies (5.9birds/km2; 95% CI=4.7-7.4) and sites burned during the preceding dormant season (6.7birds/km2; 95% CI=4.6-9.6), whereas the 29-day nest survival rate was greater on prairie dog colonies (0.81 in 2011 and 0.39 in 2012) compared to the burned sites (0.64 in 2011 and 0.17 in 2012). Reduced nest survival in 2012 compared to 2011 was associated with higher maximum daily temperatures in 2012, consistent with a previous weather-based model of mountain plover nest survival in the southern Great Plains. Measurements of mountain plover density relative to time since disturbance showed that removal of prairie dog disturbance by sylvatic plague reduced mountain plover density by 70% relative to active prairie dog colonies after 1 year. Plover densities declined at a similar rate (by 78%) at burned sites between the first and second post-burn growing season. Results indicate that black-tailed prairie dog colonies are a particularly important nesting habitat for mountain plovers in the southern Great Plains. In addition, findings suggest that prescribed burning can be a valuable means to create nesting habitat in landscapes where other types of disturbances (such as prairie dog colonies) are limited in distribution and size.

T1  - Exotic plant invasion alters chaparral ecosystem resistance and resilience pre- and post-wildfire
AN  - 1511526688
AB  - Perturbations such as wildfire and exotic plant invasion have significant impacts on soils, and the extent to which invaded soils are resistant or resilient to these disturbances varies by ecosystem type. Replacement of shrublands by herbaceous exotics pre- and post-wildfire may drastically alter soil chemical and biological properties for an unknown duration. We assessed above and belowground resistance and resilience to exotic plant invasion both before and after a chaparral wildfire. We hypothesized that exotic plant species would change chemical characteristics of chaparral soils by altering litter and microbial inputs, and that controlling exotics and seeding native species would restore chemical characteristics to pre-invaded conditions. We additionally hypothesized that exotic plant species would slow succession above- and belowground, as well as recovery of post-wildfire chaparral structure and function. Plant species composition and soil nutrient pools and cycling rates were evaluated in mature and invaded chaparral pre- and post-wildfire. Exotic plant species were weeded and native species were seeded to assess impacts of exotic competition on native species recovery. Invasion did not impact all soil characteristics before fire, but increased soil C/N ratio, pH, and N cycling rates, and reduced NO3-N availability. After fire, invasives slowed succession above- and belowground. Removal of exotics and seeding natives facilitated succession and resulted in plant composition similar to uninvaded, post-wildfire chaparral. The chaparral ecosystem was not resistant to impacts of invasion as indicated by altered soil chemistry and C and N cycling rates; however, short-term restoration led to recovery of extractable nitrogen availability indicating resilience of chaparral soils. This suggests that the permanence of exotic plant species, once established, represents a greater ecological challenge than exotic plant impacts on soils.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Role of Wildfire, Prescribed Fire, and Mountain Pine Beetle Infestations on the Population Dynamics of Black-Backed Woodpeckers in the Black Hills, South Dakota
AN  - 1977747117
AB  - Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.

T1  - Guidelines for ecological burning regimes in Mediterranean ecosystems: a case study in Banksia woodlands in Western Australia
AN  - 1546005736
AB  - In Mediterranean ecosystems prescribed burning is commonly employed to reduce the risk or intensity of wildfires. As a consequence, a major challenge for conservation land managers is the development of fire regimes that reduce damaging wildfires and are optimal for biodiversity. The aim of this paper was to develop guidelines for ecological fire regimes using the Banksia woodland on the Gnangara Groundwater System in Western Australia as a case study. Development of the guidelines involved the determination of maximum and minimum fire intervals of key fire response species, analyses of fire history records and estimation of ideal age class distributions at the landscape level. Recommendations included a) adoption of a minimum fire interval of 8-16 years, b) implementation of a burning regime to redress the current skewed distribution (60%: 1-7 years since last fire), c) retention of long-unburnt habitats that are significant for species such as the critically endangered Calyptorhynchus latirostris (Carnaby's black-cockatoo), and Tarsipes rostratus (honey possum), and d) protection for wetlands that can serve as fire 'refugia' for associated species, such as Isoodon obesulus fusciventer (southern brown bandicoot or quenda). The guidelines developed provide a model for the development of ecological burning regimes in other similar ecosystems. The implementation of ecological guidelines normally involves incorporation into fire management planning by fire agencies and often entails complex solutions to conflicting aims. The guidelines are thus valuable for ecologists and land managers, especially in light of an expected significant increase in global fire activity as a consequence of predicted climate change.

T1  - Medusahead Ecology and Management: California Annual Grasslands to the Intermountain West
AN  - 1543048695
AB  - The spread of medusahead across the western United States has severe implications for a wide range of ecosystem services. Medusahead invasion reduces biodiversity, wildlife habitat and forage production, and often leads to increased fire frequency and restoration costs. Medusahead is problematic in the Intermountain West and California Annual Grasslands. The last review of medusahead ecology and management was completed 20 years ago. Since the last review, there have been scientific advances in medusahead management suggesting a significant need to develop an up-to-date synthesis. Medusahead continues to pose a serious threat to rangeland ecosystems. In this synthesis, we present new information regarding the ecology of medusahead, suggest a framework for managing medusahead based on invasion level, and identify research needs to further improve management of this invasive annual grass. Success of different management practices varies between the Intermountain West and California Annual Grasslands, signifying that the best management practices are those specifically tailored with consideration of climate, soil, plant community characteristics, and management objectives. Prevention and control treatments that are useful in the Intermountain West may not be practical or effective in the California Annual Grasslands and vice-versa.

T1  - A Comment on "Management for Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreak Suppression: Does Relevant Science Support Current Policy?"
AN  - 1537385304
AB  - There are two general approaches for reducing the negative impacts of mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, on forests. Direct control involves short-term tactics designed to address current infestations by manipulating mountain pine beetle populations, and includes the use of fire, insecticides, semiochemicals, sanitation harvests, or a combination of these treatments. Indirect control is preventive, and designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations within treated areas by manipulating stand, forest and/or landscape conditions by reducing the number of susceptible host trees through thinning, prescribed burning, and/or alterations of age classes and species composition. We emphasize that "outbreak suppression" is not the intent or objective of management strategies implemented for mountain pine beetle in the western United States, and that the use of clear, descriptive language is important when assessing the merits of various treatment strategies.

T1  - The effects of prey, habitat heterogeneity and fire on the spatial ecology of peninsular Diamond Pythons (Morelia spilota spilota: Pythonidae)
AN  - 1509387962
AB  - Understanding an organism's home range is an important component of effective wildlife management. However, home ranges can vary spatially and temporally within and between populations. Landscape ecology theory can provide a framework for understanding spatio-temporal variability in animal traits. We used radio-telemetry in a population of diamond python Morelia spilota spilotaLacépède (Pythonidae) from a biologically rich and structurally heterogeneous reserve in eastern Australia to explore the relationship between home range size, optimal foraging theory and vegetation mosaic theory. Twelve adult snakes were tracked between September 2004 and February 2008. Male home ranges were significantly larger (P<0.05) and more variable (41±30ha) than female home ranges (23±5ha), and males moved further between observations (123m c.f. 65m). Core activity centres varied significantly among habitat (P<0.05) with larger home ranges observed in heathland, a vegetation community which supported comparatively low mammal diversity. No other variables examined including number of fixes, body length, prey abundance, vegetation heterogeneity or fire history explained home range variability. In this system, relatively high mammalian prey diversity and rapid post-fire vegetation succession may limit prey availability and fire effects as being significant determinants of home range variability in M.spilota.

T1  - Quantifying restoration effectiveness using multi‐scale habitat models: implications for sage‐grouse in the Great Basin
AN  - 2299128746
AB  - A recurrent challenge in the conservation of wide‐ranging, imperiled species is understanding which habitats to protect and whether we are capable of restoring degraded landscapes. For Greater Sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern in the western United States, we approached this problem by developing multi‐scale empirical models of occupancy in 211 randomly located plots within a 40 million ha portion of the species' range. We then used these models to predict sage‐grouse habitat quality at 826 plots associated with 101 post‐wildfire seeding projects implemented from 1990 to 2003. We also compared conditions at restoration sites to published habitat guidelines. Sage‐grouse occupancy was positively related to plot‐ and landscape‐level dwarf sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula, A. nova, A. tripartita) and big sagebrush steppe prevalence, and negatively associated with non‐native plants and human development. The predicted probability of sage‐grouse occupancy at treated plots was low on average (0.09) and not substantially different from burned areas that had not been treated. Restoration sites with quality habitat tended to occur at higher elevation locations with low annual temperatures, high spring precipitation, and high plant diversity. Of 313 plots seeded after fire, none met all sagebrush guidelines for breeding habitats, but approximately 50% met understory guidelines, particularly for perennial grasses. This pattern was similar for summer habitat. Less than 2% of treated plots met winter habitat guidelines. Restoration actions did not increase the probability of burned areas meeting most guideline criteria. The probability of meeting guidelines was influenced by a latitudinal gradient, climate, and topography. Our results suggest that sage‐grouse are relatively unlikely to use many burned areas within 20 years of fire, regardless of treatment. Understory habitat conditions are more likely to be adequate than overstory conditions, but in most climates, establishing forbs and reducing cheatgrass dominance is unlikely. Reestablishing sagebrush cover will require more than 20 years using past restoration methods. Given current fire frequencies and restoration capabilities, protection of landscapes containing a mix of dwarf sagebrush and big sagebrush steppe, minimal human development, and low non‐native plant cover may provide the best opportunity for conservation of sage‐grouse habitats.

T1  - Effects of Restoration Techniques on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Dynamics in Florida Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) Sandhill Forests
AN  - 1537384530
AB  - Historic fire suppression and intensive forest management in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) sandhill forests has resulted in hardwood encroachment and degradation of this fire-dependent ecosystem. Active management is now required to restore native community structure and composition, but little is known about the long-term impacts of typical restoration techniques on ecosystem properties. In 1994, the Longleaf Pine Restoration Project (LPRP) was established in fire-excluded longleaf pine sandhills of Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to explore the effects of restoration treatments on plant and animal community composition and soil processes. Experimental treatments applied included three hardwood reduction techniques and delayed burn. Reference sites were concurrently monitored. Fifteen years later, we revisited the LPRP plots to determine whether soil processes showed lasting treatment effects. This study showed that there were no differences in soil C and N between the reference and the fire-suppressed plots prior to the treatments, suggesting that soil C and N were relatively resistant to degradation. This study also showed that the restoration treatments had a significant effect by reducing soil C, but this effect was only short-lived (<3 years). In addition, a MRPP (multi-response permutation procedure) analysis showed that only the herbicide treatment was still different from the reference plots 15 years after the initial treatments. Thus, this study suggests that repeated fires (or lack of) or hardwood removal treatments have little detectable effect on soil nutrients in these nutrient-poor ecosystems.

T1  - Habitat suitability modelling and implications for management of roan antelopes in Kenya
AN  - 1497299874
AB  - The roan antelope is locally endangered in Kenya with <50 individuals remaining in Ruma National Park (RNP). An understanding of the habitat requirements is essential to formulate habitat management strategies for species recovery. This study identifies habitat and management features affecting roan distribution in different seasons using information-theoretic and multimodel inference (MMI) techniques. MMI averaged models were coupled with GIS data to develop habitat suitability maps. Results showed that roan habitat suitability is determined by different factors in different seasons but overall habitat was more important than management. Best predictors of roan incidence were wooded grassland, open grassland and water points. Water was more significant in the dry season whilst vegetation burned status, slope, soil type, distances to snares, park fence and security gates were important predictors at other seasons. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots confirmed that the models fitted well to the data (AUC>0.9). Sustainable conservation of roans in RNP can be achieved via long-term habitat management including prescribed burning and construction of more water points and short-term urgent solutions to key management issues, especially control of poaching.

T1  - Lizard Microhabitat and Microclimate Relationships in Southeastern Pine-Hardwood Forests Managed With Prescribed Burning and Thinning
AN  - 1515638909
AB  - Understanding the impacts of disturbances in forest ecosystems is essential for long-term biodiversity conservation. Many studies have evaluated wildlife responses to various disturbances but most generally do not use changes in microclimate features or microhabitat structure to explain these responses. We examined lizard responses to two common forest management practices (prescribed burning and thinning) in pine-hardwood forests of the Bankhead National Forest, Alabama, USA. Over 4 years, we captured 719 individual lizards representing seven species. Lizards exhibited species-specific responses to forest management: eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) captures were positively associated with an increasing forest disturbance gradient and were greatest in thin with burn treatments, whereas little brown skink (Scincella lateralis) captures were positively associated with increasing litter depth and were greatest in control sites during the first year posttreatment. Green anole (Anolis carolinensis) captures increased in forest stands with concomitant increases in air temperature, whereas common five-lined skink (Plestiodon fasciatus) captures were related to coarse woody debris cover during posttreatment sampling. We were unable to detect a treatment response or microhabitat/microclimate associations for broad-headed skinks (Plestiodon laticeps). Through an information-theoretic approach, we were able to identify treatment effects along with changes in microclimate and microhabitat features potentially responsible for driving responses of southeastern lizard species to forest management.

T1  - Management regime influences shrubland birds and habitat conditions in the Northern Appalachians, USA
AN  - 1501966349
AB  - Population declines of birds that breed in early-successional shrubland habitat are of great concern to conservationists throughout the northeastern United States. To help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of efforts to conserve these species and their habitats, we studied birds in temporary forest openings created through even-aged timber harvest, and permanent wildlife openings maintained through mechanical treatment and prescribed burning in the Northern Appalachians, USA in 2010 and 2011. We assessed the effects of treatment method, time since last treatment, and retained tree cover on shrubland bird abundance and habitat conditions. Burned and mechanically treated wildlife openings differed only in grass and fern cover. Both types of wildlife openings had more grasses and forbs, and less bare ground than silvicultural openings. Six out of 8 focal bird species were less abundant in silvicultural openings than in wildlife openings. In contrast, abundance of only 1 species differed between burned and mechanically treated wildlife openings. Silvicultural openings supported the same species as wildlife openings, indicating that this management option could be used in place of more costly wildlife opening management. However, because birds were more abundant in wildlife openings, maintaining the current population size of shrubland birds under a management strategy based entirely on silviculture would require a 50-300% increase in the area of silvicultural openings, depending on the species. Individual species peaked in abundance at different times post treatment, indicating that managers must maintain a range of early-successional conditions across the landscape to provide habitat for the entire suite of shrubland birds. Six species exhibited a negative relationship with the basal area of retained conifer cover, and 7 species with deciduous tree cover, indicating that the retention of overstory trees in openings reduced their utility to early-successional birds. © 2014 The Wildlife Society, 2014.

T1  - Is Response to Fire Influenced by Dietary Specialization and Mobility? A Comparative Study with Multiple Animal Assemblages
AN  - 1496070300
AB  - Fire is a major agent involved in landscape transformation and an indirect cause of changes in species composition. Responses to fire may vary greatly depending on life histories and functional traits of species. We have examined the taxonomic and functional responses to fire of eight taxonomic animal groups displaying a gradient of dietary and mobility patterns: Gastropoda, Heteroptera, Formicidae, Coleoptera, Araneae, Orthoptera, Reptilia and Aves. The fieldwork was conducted in a Mediterranean protected area on 3 sites (one unburnt and two burnt with different postfire management practices) with five replicates per site. We collected information from 4606 specimens from 274 animal species. Similarity in species composition and abundance between areas was measured by the Bray-Curtis index and ANOSIM, and comparisons between animal and plant responses by Mantel tests. We analyze whether groups with the highest percentage of omnivorous species, these species being more generalist in their dietary habits, show weak responses to fire (i.e. more similarity between burnt and unburnt areas), and independent responses to changes in vegetation. We also explore how mobility, i.e. dispersal ability, influences responses to fire. Our results demonstrate that differences in species composition and abundance between burnt and unburnt areas differed among groups. We found a tendency towards presenting lower differences between areas for groups with higher percentages of omnivorous species. Moreover, taxa with a higher percentage of omnivorous species had significantly more independent responses of changes in vegetation. High- (e.g. Aves) and low-mobility (e.g. Gastropoda) groups had the strongest responses to fire (higher R scores of the ANOSIM); however, we failed to find a significant general pattern with all the groups according to their mobility. Our results partially support the idea that functional traits underlie the response of organisms to environmental changes caused by fire.

T1  - Post-fire salvage logging alters species composition and reduces cover, richness, and diversity in Mediterranean plant communities
AN  - 1492654150
AB  - An intense debate exists on the effects of post-fire salvage logging on plant community regeneration, but scant data are available derived from experimental studies. We analyzed the effects of salvage logging on plant community regeneration in terms of species richness, diversity, cover, and composition by experimentally managing a burnt forest on a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada, S Spain). In each of three plots located at different elevations, three replicates of three treatments were implemented seven months after the fire, differing in the degree of intervention: "Non-Intervention" (all trees left standing), "Partial Cut plus Lopping" (felling 90% of the trees, cutting the main branches, and leaving all the biomass in situ), and "Salvage Logging" (felling and piling the logs, and masticating the woody debris). Plant composition in each treatment was monitored two years after the fire in linear point transects. Post-fire salvage logging was associated with reduced species richness, Shannon diversity, and total plant cover. Moreover, salvaged sites hosted different species assemblages and 25% lower cover of seeder species (but equal cover of resprouters) compared to the other treatments. Cover of trees and shrubs was also lowest in Salvage Logging, which could suggest a potential slow-down of forest regeneration. Most of these results were consistent among the three plots despite plots hosting different plant communities. Concluding, our study suggests that salvage logging may reduce species richness and diversity, as well as the recruitment of woody species, which could delay the natural regeneration of the ecosystem.

T1  - Temporal changes in the breeding bird community caused by post-fire treatments after the Samcheok forest fire in Korea
AN  - 1495448269
AB  - The Samcheok forest fire of April 2000 was the biggest stand-replacing fire recorded in Korea, and led to the largest-scale salvage logging operation (performed until 2005) ever implemented. We investigated the effects of the treatments performed after the fire on the breeding bird community in 2002-2005 (the management period) and 2006-2008 (the post-management period). A total of 75 line transect surveys resulted in 660 detections of 54 species in undisturbed stands (CO), in burned and naturally restored stands (NI), and in burned and logged stands (IT). Four species (Parus major, Aegithalos caudatus, Dendrocopos kizuki, and Parus ater) were identified as indicator species in CO which showed no temporal changes in bird communities and habitat structure. Among the various stand treatments, the standardized species richness was highest in CO (11.6 ± 4.6 species/transect in 2002-2005, 12.1 ± 3.5 in 2006-2008), and this richness did not change over time. On the other hand, low richness was observed in NI (6.8 ± 2.6 in 2002-2005, 9.6 ± 2.3 in 2006-2008), and the lowest richness was seen in IT (5.0 ± 2.4 in 2002-2005, 6.1 ± 1.8 in 2006-2008), but both of these increased over time. Although the bird abundances in NI and IT were lower than those in CO (38.0 ± 27.7 birds/transect in 2002-2005, 31.3 ± 10.9 in 2006-2008), the abundances in NI (15.1 ± 8.6 in 2002-2005, 17.6 ± 11.4 in 2006-2008) and IT (11.7 ± 8.3 in 2002-2005, 10.0 ± 4.6 in 2006-2008) were not significantly different. There was no significant difference in abundance between time periods for any of the stand treatments. These results imply that NI (i.e., no salvage logging) allows greater bird richness but not abundance to be recovered compared to IT. No indicator species was consistently present in NI throughout the two time periods covered due to the rapid regrowth of vegetation, but four open-habitat dwellers (Falco tinnunculus, Phoenicurus auroreus, Emberiza cioides, and Sturnus cineraceus) colonized IT during the post-management period. The bird assemblage in IT, as assessed by canonical correspondence analysis, shifted to open habitats, while the avifauna in NI became similar to that in CO over time. While post-fire treatment can provide new colonization opportunities for open-habitat dwellers, the slow colonization process, the low species richness, and the low bird abundance observed in large areas of IT indicate that post-fire treatment using salvage logging inhibits the restoration of forest bird communities by producing a poorer breeding bird community that is very different from the original one. Based on these lessons from the response to the Samcheok forest fire, we suggest that preserving as much of the disturbed forest as possible is essential, and that the current approach to post-fire treatment--intensive salvage logging--needs to be revised to ensure the effective restoration of breeding bird communities in disturbed temperate pine forests.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nest occurrence and survival of King Rails in fire-managed coastal marshes in North Carolina and Virginia
AN  - 1461324629
AB  - Prescribed burning maintains marsh habitat, but its impact on breeding King Rails (Rallus elegans) is poorly understood. This practice may serve as a means to enhance populations of a species whose numbers are declining in the southeastern United States. We used call-broadcast surveys and nest searches to categorize the state of occupied plots by the presence or non-presence of nesting activity in the Back Bay region, North Carolina and Virginia, in 2010. We also used nest video surveillance to estimate nest survival in 2009 and 2010. The probabilities that a surveyed plot was occupied (ψ 1) and contained an active nest (ψ 2) were higher in recently burned marsh plots (0-1 year-since-burn [YSB]) than in plots with ≥2 YSB at Mackay Island and Back Bay National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs). Highest probabilities were recorded in 0-1 YSB plots at Mackay Island NWR (ψ  1 = 0.96 ± 0.04, ψ  2 = 0.75 ± 0.18), and the lowest in ≥2 YSB plots at Back Bay NWR (ψ  1 = 0.21 ± 0.10, ψ  2 = 0.03 ± 0.04). Nest survival from egg laying to hatching (31 d) was 0.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06-0.83), with an estimated 0.79 (95% CI = 0.29-0.96) survival rate for the incubation stage (21 d). These nest survival estimates for King Rails in fire-managed marshes were similar to estimates for other populations. Measures of vegetation cover, proxies for concealment, did not differ between nest sites and unused sites, even within recently burned marshes. This lack of differences in vegetation structure suggests that regrowth occurs rapidly during the period between burning (winter months) and the onset of reproduction (late April). Thus, recently burned marshes may benefit nesting King Rails by providing nest concealment. In addition, burned marshes may enhance availability of many invertebrates. Although we found that the probability that surveyed plots contained active nests was higher in recently burned marsh plots, estimates of fledging success are needed before marsh burns can be considered an effective means of fostering population growth.

              
RESUMEN

              
Ocurrencia de nidos y supervivencia del Rascón real en pantanos costeros con manejo de fuego en Carolina del Norte y Virginia

              
Los incendios controlados ayudan a mantener los pantanos, pero su impacto en la reproducción del Rascón real (Rallus elegans) está poco estudiado. Esta práctica puede servir como un medio de incrementar poblaciones de una especie cuyos números han declinado en el sudeste de Estados Unidos. Usamos censos con playback y búsqueda de nidos a fin de categorizar el estado de ocupación de parcelas por la presencia o ausencia de actividad de nido en la región de Back Bay, en Carolina del Norte y Virginia, en 2010. Utilizamos también monitoreo por video de nidos para estimar la supervivencia de nido en 2009 y 2010. Las probabilidades de que una parcela censada se encontrara ocupado (ψ  1) y de que contuviese nidos activos (ψ  2) fueron más altos en pantanos recientemente incendiados (0-1 años desde quema [ADQ]) que en parcelas con ≥2 ADQ en Isla Mackay y en el Refugio Nacional de Vida Silvestre (RNVS) de Back Bay. Las probabilidades más altas fueron registradas en parcelas con 0-1 ADQ en Isla Mackay Island RNVS (ψ  1 = 0.96 ± 0.04, ψ  2 = 0.75 ± 0.18), y la más baja en parcelas con ADQ 2 en Back Bay RNVS (ψ  1 = 0.21 ± 0.10, ψ  2 = 0.03 ± 0.04). La supervivencia de nido desde la puesto de huevos hasta la eclosión (31 días) fue de 0.48 (95% IC = 0.06-0.83), con un estimado de 0.79 (95% IC = 0.29-0.96) para la tasa de supervivencia para el estadio de incubación (21 días). Estos estimados para la supervivencia de nidos para el Rascón real en pantanos con manejo del fuego controlados fueron similares a los estimados para otras poblaciones. Las medidas de cubertura vegetal, representantes de camuflaje, no difirieron entre las parcelas con nidos y las parcelas sin nidos, aún dentro de pantanos recientemente quemados. Esta falta de diferencias en la estructura de la vegetación sugiere que el crecimiento de la vegetación ocurre rápidamente en el período entre la quema (meses de invierno) y el inicio de la temporada reproductiva (fines de Abril). Así, pantanos recientemente quemados podrían beneficiar a la nidada del Rascón real al proveer camuflaje para el nido. Adicionalmente, los pantanos quemados podrían aumentar la disponibilidad de muchos invertebrados. Aún cuando encontramos que la probabilidad de que las parcelas censadas contuviesen nidos activos era mayor en parcelas recientemente quemadas, estimaciones del éxito de los volantones son necesarias antes de que la quema en pantanos pueda ser considerada como un medio efectivo de estimular el crecimiento poblacional.

T1  - Ensemble modeling to predict habitat suitability for a large‐scale disturbance specialist
AN  - 2299142428
AB  - To conserve habitat for disturbance specialist species, ecologists must identify where individuals will likely settle in newly disturbed areas. Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat suitability for nesting Black‐backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a burned‐forest specialist) at 20 recently (≤6 years postwildfire) burned locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis D2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables describing burn severity, the north–south orientation of topographic slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions into binary classifications (0 = low suitability to unsuitable, 1 = high to moderate suitability), we compiled “ensemble predictions,” consisting of the number of models (0–8) predicting any given site as highly suitable. The suitability status for 40% of the area burned by eastside Montana wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2) declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., “no‐analogue”) environments. Areas of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black‐backed Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with habitat conservation in burned‐forest landscapes where black‐backed woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available. Ensemble modeling represents a promising tool for guiding conservation of large‐scale disturbance specialists.

T1  - River Ecosystem Response to Prescribed Vegetation Burning on Blanket peatland
AN  - 1460505540
AB  - Catchment-scale land-use change is recognised as a major threat to aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning globally. In the UK uplands rotational vegetation burning is practised widely to boost production of recreational game birds, and while some recent studies have suggested burning can alter river water quality there has been minimal attention paid to effects on aquatic biota. We studied ten rivers across the north of England between March 2010 and October 2011, five of which drained burned catchments and five from unburned catchments. There were significant effects of burning, season and their interaction on river macroinvertebrate communities, with rivers draining burned catchments having significantly lower taxonomic richness and Simpson’s diversity. ANOSIM revealed a significant effect of burning on macroinvertebrate community composition, with typically reduced Ephemeroptera abundance and diversity and greater abundance of Chironomidae and Nemouridae. Grazer and collector-gatherer feeding groups were also significantly less abundant in rivers draining burned catchments. These biotic changes were associated with lower pH and higher Si, Mn, Fe and Al in burned systems. Vegetation burning on peatland therefore has effects beyond the terrestrial part of the system where the management intervention is being practiced. Similar responses of river macroinvertebrate communities have been observed in peatlands disturbed by forestry activity across northern Europe. Finally we found river ecosystem changes similar to those observed in studies of wild and prescribed forest fires across North America and South Africa, illustrating some potentially generic effects of fire on aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Fire as a disturbance in mediterranean climate streams
AN  - 1439196728
AB  - Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade

              
Mediterranean climate ecosystems are among the most fire-prone in the world; however, little is known about the effects of fire on mediterranean streams (med-streams). Fire impacts on med-streams are associated with increased runoff and erosion from severely burned landscapes during storms, particularly the first intense rains. Increased inputs of water, solutes, nutrients, sediment, organic matter, and ash to streams after fires are usually observed for months to up to 4 years. Return to pre-fire conditions is associated with vegetation recovery. Benthic algae, invertebrates, and fish are reduced to low levels by scouring floods after wildfire. If riparian zones are burned, benthic algae increase, and invertebrate communities become dominated by r-strategist species. Fishes are eradicated from reaches affected by intense wildfire and often do not re-colonize quickly because of downstream barriers. In general, med-stream communities appear to be more resilient to fire compared to streams in other ecosystems because of the rapid recovery of mediterranean upland and riparian vegetation and geomorphological conditions (1-4 years in med-streams vs 5-10 years in non-med streams). However, drought or mass sediment movements after fire can prolong fire effects. Studies of the long-term effects of fire and the consequences of fire management practices are still needed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Disturbance and the role of refuges in mediterranean climate streams
AN  - 1439196691
AB  - Issue Title: Streams in mediterranean climate regions: lessons learned from the last decade

              
Refuges protect plant and animal populations from disturbance. Knowledge of refuges from disturbance in mediterranean climate rivers (med-rivers) has increased the last decade. We review disturbance processes and their relationship to refuges in streams in mediterranean climate regions (med-regions). Med-river fauna show high endemicity and their populations are often exposed to disturbance; hence the critical importance of refuges during (both seasonal and supraseasonal) disturbances. Disturbance pressures are increasing in med-regions, in particular from climatic change, salinisation, sedimentation, water extraction, hydropower generation, supraseasonal drought, and wildfire. Med-rivers show annual cycles of constrained precipitation and predictable seasonal drying, causing the biota to depend on seasonal refuges, in particular, those that are spatially predictable. This creates a spatial and temporal mosaic of inundation that determines habitat extent and refuge function. Refuges of sufficient size and duration to maintain populations, such as perennially flowing reaches, sustain biodiversity and may harbour relict populations, particularly during increasing aridification, where little other suitable habitat remains in landscapes. Therefore, disturbances that threaten perennial flows potentially cascade disproportionately to reduce regional scale biodiversity in med-regions. Conservation approaches for med-river systems need to conserve both refuges and refuge connectivity, reduce the impact of anthropogenic disturbances and sustain predictable, seasonal flow patterns.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Explaining Geographic Gradients in Winter Selection of Landscapes by Boreal Caribou with Implications under Global Changes in Eastern Canada
AN  - 1445884987
AB  - Many animal species exhibit broad-scale latitudinal or longitudinal gradients in their response to biotic and abiotic components of their habitat. Although knowing the underlying mechanism of these patterns can be critical to the development of sound measures for the preservation or recovery of endangered species, few studies have yet identified which processes drive the existence of geographical gradients in habitat selection. Using extensive spatial data of broad latitudinal and longitudinal extent, we tested three hypotheses that could explain the presence of geographical gradients in landscape selection of the endangered boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) during winter in Eastern Canadian boreal forests: 1) climate-driven selection, which postulates that geographic gradients are surrogates for climatic gradients; 2) road-driven selection, which proposes that boreal caribou adjust their selection for certain habitat classes as a function of proximity to roads; and 3) an additive effect of both roads and climate. Our data strongly supported road-driven selection over climate influences. Thus, direct human alteration of landscapes drives boreal caribou distribution and should likely remain so until the climate changes sufficiently from present conditions. Boreal caribou avoided logged areas two-fold more strongly than burnt areas. Limiting the spread of road networks and accounting for the uneven impact of logging compared to wildfire should therefore be integral parts of any habitat management plan and conservation measures within the range of the endangered boreal caribou. The use of hierarchical spatial models allowed us to explore the distribution of spatially-structured errors in our models, which in turn provided valuable insights for generating alternative hypotheses about processes responsible for boreal caribou distribution.

T1  - Conservation planning in a fire-prone Mediterranean region: threats and opportunities for bird species
AN  - 1437333146
AB  - In response to the processes threatening biodiversity such as habitat loss, effective selection of priority conservation areas is required. However, reserve selection methods usually ignore the drivers of future habitat changes, thus compromising the effectiveness of conservation. In this work, we formulated an approach to explicitly quantify the impact of fire on conservation areas, considering such disturbance as a driver of land-cover changes. The estimated fire impact was integrated as a constraint in the reserve selection process to tackle the likely threats or opportunities that fire disturbance might cause to the targeted species depending on their habitat requirements. In this way, we selected conservation areas in a fire-prone Mediterranean region for two bird assemblages: forest and open-habitat species. Differences in conservation areas selected before and after integrating the impact of fire in the reserve selection process were assessed. Integration of fire impact for forest species moved preferences towards areas that were less prone to burn. However, a larger area was required to achieve the same conservation goals. Conversely, integration of fire impacts for open-habitat species shifted preferences towards conservation areas in locations where the persistence of their required habitat is more likely (i.e. shrublands). In other words, we prioritized the conservation of not only the current distribution of open-habitat birds, but also the disturbance process (i.e. fire) that favours their preferred habitat and distributions in the long term. Finally, this work emphasizes the need to consider the opposing potential impacts of wildfires on species for an effective conservation planning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Lichen Conservation in Heavily Managed Boreal Forests
AN  - 1437200310
AB  - Lichens are an important component of the boreal forest, where they are long lived, tend to accumulate in older stands, and are a major food source for the threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). To be fully sustainable, silvicultural practices in the boreal forest must include the conservation of ecological integrity. Dominant forest management practices, however, have short-term negative effects on lichen diversity, particularly the application of herbicides. To better understand the long-term effects of forest management, we examined lichen regeneration in 35 mixed black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest stands across northern Ontario to determine recovery following logging and postharvest silvicultural practices. Our forest stands were 25-40 years old and had undergone 3 common sivilcultural treatments that included harvested and planted; harvested, planted, and treated with N-[phosphonomethyl] glycine (glyphosate); and harvested, planted, and treated with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Forest stands with herbicide treatments had lower lichen biomass and higher beta and gamma diversity than planted stands that were not treated chemically or control stands. In northwestern Ontario, planted stands that were not treated chemically had significantly greater (p < 0.05) alpha diversity than stands treated with herbicides or control stands. Our results show that common silvicultural practices do not emulate natural disturbances caused by wildfires in the boreal forest for the lichen community. We suggest a reduction in the amount of chemical application be considered in areas where lichen biomass is likely to be high and where the recovery of woodland caribou is an objective.

T1  - Influence of fire and salvage logging on site occupancy of spotted owls in the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains of Southern California
AN  - 1428331230
AB  - Fire over the past decade has affected forests in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California, providing an excellent opportunity to examine how this disturbance, and subsequent post-fire salvage logging, influenced California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) breeding-season site occupancy dynamics there and in the nearby San Jacinto Mountains. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for all-detections and pairs-only data, we estimated annual extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 unburned breeding-season sites before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically significant effects of fire or salvage logging on occupancy dynamics of spotted owls of southern California. However, we found some evidence that fire and logging effects could be biologically meaningful. For pairs data, the model-averaged mean of fire-related effects on colonization and extinction probabilities resulted in a 0.062 lesser site-occupancy probability in burned sites 1-year post-fire relative to unburned sites. Post-fire salvage logging reduced occupancy an additional 0.046 relative to sites that only burned. We documented a threshold-type relationship between extinction and colonization probabilities and the amount of forested habitat (conifer or hardwood tree cover types) that burned at high severity within a 203-ha core area around spotted owl nests and roost centroids. Sites where approximately 0-50ha of forested habitat within the core area burned at high severity had extinction probabilities similar to unburned sites, but where more than approximately 50ha of forested habitat burned severely, extinction probability increased approximately 0.003 for every additional hectare severely burned. The majority (75%) of sites burned below this threshold. Sites where high-severity fire affected >50ha of forested habitat could still support spotted owls, so all burned sites should be monitored for occupancy before management actions such as salvage logging are undertaken that could be detrimental to the subspecies. We also recommend that managers strive to reduce human-caused ignitions along the wildland-urban interface, particularly at lower elevations where owl sites are at higher risk of extinction from fire. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Short-term effects of forest disturbances on soil nematode communities in European mountain spruce forests
AN  - 1412142199; 23046609
AB  - Abstract

              
The nematode communities in spruce forests were compared with the short-term effects of forest damage, caused by windstorm, wildfire and management practices of forest soils. Soil samples were collected in June and October from 2006 to 2008 in four different sites: (1) forest unaffected by the wind (REF); (2) storm-felled forest with salvaged timber (EXT); (3) modified forest affected by timber salvage (wood removal) and forest fire (FIR); and (4) storm-felled forest where timber had been left unsalvaged (NEX). Nematode analysis showed that the dominant species in all four investigated sites were Acrobeloides nanus and Eudorylaimus silvaticus. An increase of A. nanus (35% of the total nematode abundance) in the first year in the FIR site led to the highest total abundance of nematodes compared with other sites, where nematode abundance reached the same level in the third year. In the FIR site bacterial feeders appeared to be the most representative trophic group, although in the second and third year, after disturbance, the abundance of this trophic group gradually decreased. In the NEX site, the number of nematode species, population densities and Maturity Index were similar to that recorded for the FIR site. In EXT and NEX sites, the other dominant species was the plant parasitic nematode Paratylenchus microdorus. Analyses of nematodes extracted from different forest soil samples showed that the highest number of species and diversity index for species (H'spp) were in the REF site. Differences between the nematode fauna in REF and other localities were clearly depicted by cluster analysis. The greatest Structure Index and Enrichment Index values were also in REF. In the EXT site, the number of nematode species, their abundance, H'spp and Maturity Index were not significantly different from those recorded in the reference site. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Unintended Consequences of Invasive Predator Control in an Australian Forest: Overabundant Wallabies and Vegetation Change
AN  - 1430787831
AB  - Over-abundance of native herbivores is a problem in many forests worldwide. The abundance of native macropod wallabies is extremely high at Booderee National Park (BNP) in south-eastern Australia. This has occurred because of the reduction of exotic predators through an intensive baiting program, coupled with the absence of other predators. The high density of wallabies at BNP may be inhibiting the recruitment of many plant species following fire-induced recruitment events. We experimentally examined the post-fire response of a range of plant species to browsing by wallabies in a forest heavily infested with the invasive species, bitou bush Chrysanthemoides monilifera. We recorded the abundance and size of a range of plant species in 18 unfenced (browsed) and 16 fenced (unbrowsed) plots. We found the abundance and size of bitou bush was suppressed in browsed plots compared to unbrowsed plots. Regenerating seedlings of the canopy or middle storey tree species Eucalyptus pilularis, Acacia implexa, Allocasuarina littoralis, Breynia oblongifolia and Banksia integrifolia were either smaller or fewer in number in grazed plots than treatment plots as were the vines Kennedia rubicunda, Glycine tabacina and Glycine clandestina. In contrast, the understorey fern, Pteridium esculentum increased in abundance in the browsed plots relative to unbrowsed plots probably because of reduced competition with more palatable angiosperms. Twelve months after plots were installed the community structure of the browsed and unbrowsed plots was significantly different (P = 0.023, Global R = 0.091). The relative abundance of C. monilifera and P. esculentum contributed most to the differences. We discuss the possible development of a low diversity bracken fern parkland in Booderee National Park through a trophic cascade, similar to that caused by overabundant deer in the northern hemisphere. We also discuss its implications for broad scale fox control in southern Australian forests.

T1  - Stand structure and breeding birds: Implications for restoring ponderosa pine forests
AN  - 1420295792
AB  - Fire-adapted forests in the western United States have dramatically departed from the natural or evolutionary environment over the past century because of fire suppression, logging, grazing, and other management practices. In particular, most southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests are characterized by dense stands of small-diameter trees that are susceptible to stand-replacing crown fires and ensuing damage to watersheds, wildlife habitat, and communities at the wildland-urban interface. Restoration treatments using mechanical thinning and prescribed fire have become the dominant management paradigm in this forest type, with landscape-scale projects being implemented over the next 20 years. Although many studies have examined wildlife responses to restoration treatments, single-species information is difficult for managers to synthesize and incorporate into management decisions made at large scales. Our goal was to investigate responses of breeding birds in ponderosa pine forests to forest stand characteristics modified by restoration treatments. We sampled birds in 23 stands for 3 years in northern Arizona, and used multi-season and multi-species occupancy models to determine relationships between avian occupancy and stand attributes affected by treatment. Increasing occupancy rates and species richness were associated with decreasing canopy cover, increasing density of mature trees, and increasing density of snags. Occupancy rates and species richness were negatively associated with quadratic mean diameter, medium-sized trees, and downed woody material. Associations of the avian community and individual species with herbaceous cover and tree clumping were less consistent. Our results support the implementation of forest restoration treatments for restoring avian community occupancy in ponderosa pine forests, and emulating the evolutionary environment is likely the best approach. We recommend reducing canopy cover via thinning, and retaining trees >45.7cm diameter at breast height and snags. A commonly-proposed diameter cap for retaining large trees after thinning (40.6cmdbh) seems unlikely to benefit nesting passerines, as resulting tree densities would remain too large. We recommend occupancy modeling as an efficient method for assessing wildlife-habitat relationships at large scales. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Evaluating the role of fire disturbance in structuring small reptile communities in temperate forests
AN  - 1415564506
AB  - Fire is an integral disturbance shaping forest community dynamics over large scales. However, understanding the relationship between fire induced habitat disturbance and biodiversity remain equivocal. Ecological theories including the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) and the habitat accommodation model (HAM) offer predictive frameworks that could explain faunal responses to fire disturbances. We used an 80 year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small reptile community responses to fires in temperate forests across 74 sites. First, we evaluated if changes in species richness, abundance and evenness post-fire followed trends of prior predictions, including the IDH. Second, using competing models of fine scale habitat elements we evaluated the specific ways which fire influenced small reptiles. Third, we evaluated support for the HAM by examining compositional changes of reptile community post-fire. Relative abundance was positively correlated to age post-fire while richness and evenness showed no associations. The abundance trend was as expected based on the prior prediction of sustained population increase post-disturbance, but the trend for richness contradicted the prediction of highest diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance (according to IDH). Abundance changes were driven mainly by changes in overstorey, ground layer, and shelter, while richness and evenness did not associate with any vegetation parameter. Community composition was not strongly correlated to age since fire, thus support for the HAM was weak. Overall, in this ecosystem, frequent fire disturbances can be detrimental to small reptiles. Future studies utilizing approaches based on species traits could enhance our understanding of biodiversity patterns post-disturbance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Interactive effects of temporal and spatial fire characteristics on the population dynamics of a fire-dependent Cypress species
AN  - 1411283335
AB  - Current predictions about climate change and its impact on fire regimes have spurred research on how increasing fire frequencies will affect the population dynamics of fire-dependent species. There has been less consideration of changes in the spatial characteristics of fire regimes, despite recognition of the importance of spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in population dynamics. Here, we test the hypothesis that spatial heterogeneity in fire regimes may not benefit obligate seeders with canopy seed bank, due to regeneration constraints into non-burned areas. We develop a size-structured population model for a population of Tecate cypress Callitropsis forbesii (Jeps.) Little, a rare obligate seeder of conservation concern, across a complex landscape in the Santa Ana Mountains (Orange, CA, USA). Combining the population model with field measurements of stand structure and fire history, we test the roles of heterogeneity in fire regime and dispersal among patches with differing fire history on population persistence. The model predicts population persistence at fire return intervals >17 years, the approximate fire return interval at the site over the last century. However, population growth and population persistence increase when subpopulations are connected by dispersal and, within a small window of fire return intervals, when subpopulations have uncorrelated fire dynamics. Contrary to our expectations, spatial heterogeneity in fire regime increased population growth rates at intermediate (15-25 year) fire return intervals. Conservation efforts focused on isolated populations of fire-dependent species should focus on both the temporal (fire return interval) and spatial (heterogeneity in fire occurrence) aspects of fire regimes. For one threatened Cypress species, we find that the interaction between temporal and spatial characteristics of a fire regime can increase the risks of population extinction, particularly under fire regimes characterized by more frequent, larger and more spatially homogenous fire. Species with fragmented subpopulations not well connected by dispersal also have a greater risk of extinction under these fire regimes.

T1  - Genetic restoration in the eastern collared lizard under prescribed woodland burning
AN  - 1399118150
AB  - Eastern collared lizards of the Ozarks live in glades--open, rocky habitats embedded in a woodland matrix. Past fire suppression had made the woodlands a barrier to dispersal, leading to habitat destruction, fragmentation and local extinction. Reintroduced populations of lizards were subjected to 10 years of habitat fragmentation under continued fire suppression followed by twelve years of landscape restoration with prescribed burns. Prior to prescribed burning, genetic diversity decreased within glades and differentiation increased among glades. With woodland burning, genetic diversity within glades first decreased during an expanding colonization phase, but then increased as a dynamically stable metapopulation was established. Population differentiation among glades also stabilized in the metapopulation under weak isolation-by-distance. This study is one of the first to examine the genetic changes in a species of conservation concern throughout all the stages of decline and recovery and shows the importance of landscape-level restoration for maintaining the genetic integrity of populations. This study also demonstrates how mark-recapture and genetic data together can yield detailed insight into metapopulation dynamics that would be impossible from just one type of data alone.

T1  - Extinction, reintroduction, and restoration of a lizard meta-population equilibrium in the missouri ozarks
AN  - 1399117705
AB  - In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Neuwald & Templeton (2013) report on a 22-year study of natural populations of Collared Lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) that evolved on isolated on rock outcrops ('glades') in the Ozark Mountains in eastern Missouri. This ecosystem was originally maintained by frequent fires that kept the forest understory open, but fire-suppression was adopted as official policy in about 1945, which led to a loss of native biodiversity, including local extinctions of some lizard populations. Policies aimed at restoring biodiversity included controlled burns and re-introductions of lizards to some glades, which began in 1984. Populations were monitored from 1984-2006, and demographic and genetic data collected from 1 679 lizards were used to documents shifts in meta-population dynamics over four distinct phases of lizard recovery: 1-an initial translocation of lizards drawn from the same source populations onto three glades that were likely part of one meta-population; 2-a period of isolation and genetic drift associated with the absence of fires; 3-a period of rapid colonization and population increase following restoration of fire; and 4-stabilization of the meta-population under regular prescribed burning. This study system thus provides a rare opportunity to characterize the dynamics of a landscape-scale management strategy on the restoration of the meta-population of a reintroduced species; long-term case studies of the extinction, founding, increase, and stabilization of a well-defined meta-population, based on both demographic and population genetic data, are rare in the conservation, ecological, and evolutionary literature.

T1  - Response of Six-Lined Racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata) to Habitat Restoration in Fire-Suppressed Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) Sandhills
AN  - 1373430781
AB  - Six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata) is an indicator species of frequently burned Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests. To evaluate how the species responded to forest restoration, we conducted a mark-recapture study in formerly fire-suppressed Longleaf pine  forests exposed to prescribed fire or fire surrogates (i.e. mechanical or herbicide-facilitated hardwood removal) as well as in fire-suppressed control sites and reference sites, which represented the historic condition. After initial treatment, all sites were exposed to over a decade of prescribed burning with an average return interval of approximately 2 years. We used population-level response of A. sexlineata as an indicator of the effectiveness of the different treatments in restoring habitat. Specifically, we compared mean numbers of marked adults and juveniles at treatment sites to that of reference sites. After 4 years, restoration objectives were met at sites treated with burning alone and at sites treated with mechanical removal of hardwoods followed by fire. After over 10 years of prescribed burning, restoration objectives were met at all treatments. We conclude that prescribed burning alone was sufficient to restore fire-suppressed Longleaf pine sandhills for A. sexlineata populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - DESERT FIRES FUELED BY NATIVE ANNUAL FORBS: EFFECTS OF FIRE ON COMMUNITIES OF PLANTS AND BIRDS IN THE LOWER SONORAN DESERT OF ARIZONA
AN  - 1458313001
AB  - Fire ignited by humans swept from Yuma Proving Grounds into Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, burning ca. 9,255 ha of Wilderness Area. The authors have estimated the area damaged by fire using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which are more accurate and reduce subjectivity of aerial surveys of perimeters of fires. Assemblages of upland and xeroriparian plants lost 91% and 81% of live cover, respectively, in fires. King Valley was an important xeroriparian corridor for birds. Species richness of birds decreased significantly following the fire. Numbers of breeding birds were lower in burned areas of King Valley 3 years post-fire, compared to numbers in nearby, but unburned Alamo Wash. Although birds function within a large geographic scale, the extent of this burn still influenced the relative abundance of local species of breeding birds. This suggests that, breeding birds respond to conditions of localized burns and slow recovery of vegetation contributes to continued lower numbers of birds in the burned sites in King Valley.

T1  - Long-term effects of rotational prescribed burning and low-intensity sheep grazing on blanket-bog plant communities
AN  - 1356027855
AB  - The importance of peatlands is being increasingly recognized internationally for both the conservation of biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services; strategies are being developed world-wide to help maintain their integrity. Prescribed burning has been highlighted as a threat with considerable debate over its use as it is perceived to produce a Calluna vulgaris monoculture and a decline in preferred peat-forming species. We investigated the impact of prescribed burning on vegetation composition and diversity in a long-term experiment at Moor House NNR in northern England. The study comprised a comparison between no-burn reference plots last burned in ca. 1924 and an experiment where all plots were burned in 1954/5. Within the experiment, the effects of very light sheep grazing vs. no grazing and three burning rotations (no-burn since 1954/5, repeat-burning at 10- and 20-year intervals) were tested. Calluna vulgaris and Hypnum jutlandicum cover and bryophyte species richness increased in the least-disturbed, no-burn reference plots, but bryophyte cover did not. Lichen diversity declined. Within the formal experiment, low-intensity sheep grazing had little impact but there were substantive changes produced by the different burning rotations. There was divergence between the burning rotation treatments with the least-disturbed, no-burn treatment changing towards a C. vulgaris-H. jutlandicum community, whereas the most-disturbed 10-year rotation had a much greater abundance of both Eriophorum and Sphagnum spp. Our findings suggest that blanket-bog vegetation on peat responds to prescribed burning in a complex manner. Where burn return interval is long (>20 years), C. vulgaris becomes dominant and there was no evidence that preferred peat-forming species (Eriophorum/Sphagnum) increased. Where burn return interval is short (10 years), E. vaginatum/Sphagnum abundance increased. We found no evidence to suggest that prescribed burning was deleterious to the abundance of peat-forming species; indeed, it was found to favour them. These results inform conservation management policy for blanket bogs in the UK and more generally for future wildfire-mitigation strategies on dwarf-shrub-dominated peatlands elsewhere. Some lessons for the management of long-term experimental studies are also discussed.

T1  - Relationship between wildfire, salvage logging, and occupancy of nesting territories by northern spotted owls
AN  - 1420288848
AB  - The northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) is one of the most intensively studied raptors in the world; however, little is known about the impacts of wildfire on the subspecies and how they use recently burned areas. Three large-scale wildfires in southwest Oregon provided an opportunity to investigate the short-term impacts of wildfire and salvage logging on site occupancy of spotted owls. We used Program MARK to develop single-species, multiple-season models of site occupancy using data collected during demographic surveys of spotted owl territories. In our first analysis, we compared occupancy dynamics of spotted owl nesting territories before (1992-2002) and after the Timbered Rock burn (2003-2006) to a reference area in the south Cascade Mountains that was not affected recently by wildfire. We found that the South Cascades had greater colonization probabilities than Timbered Rock before and after wildfire (${\rm {\hat {\beta }}} = 1.31$, 95% CI=0.60-2.03), and colonization probabilities declined over time at both areas (${\rm {\hat {\beta }}} = - 0.06$, 95% CI=-0.12 to 0.00). Extinction probabilities were greater at South Cascades than at Timbered Rock prior to the burn (${\rm {\hat {\beta }}} = 0.69$, 95% CI=0.23-2.62); however, Timbered Rock had greater extinction probabilities following wildfire (${\rm {\hat {\beta }}} = 1.46$, 95% CI=0.29-2.62). The Timbered Rock and South Cascades study areas had similar patterns in site occupancy prior to the Timbered Rock burn (1992-2001). Furthermore, Timbered Rock had a 64% reduction in site occupancy following wildfire (2003-2006) in contrast to a 25% reduction in site occupancy at South Cascades during the same time period. This suggested that the combined effects of habitat disturbances due to wildfire and subsequent salvage logging on private lands negatively affected site occupancy by spotted owls. In our second analysis, we investigated the relationship between wildfire, salvage logging, and occupancy of spotted owl territories at the Biscuit, Quartz, and Timbered Rock burns from 2003 to 2006. Extinction probabilities increased as the combined area of early seral forests, high severity burn, and salvage logging increased within the core nesting areas (${\rm {\hat {\beta }}} = 1.88$, 95% CI=0.10-3.66). We were unable to identify any relationships between initial occupancy or colonization probabilities and the habitat covariates that we considered in our analysis where the [beta] coefficient did not overlap zero. We concluded that site occupancy of spotted owl nesting territories declined in the short-term following wildfire, and habitat modification and loss due to past timber harvest, high severity fire, and salvage logging jointly contributed to declines in site occupancy. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Aboriginal Precedent for Active Management of Sagebrush-Perennial Grass Communities in the Great Basin
AN  - 1365844581
AB  - Until recently, most contemporary ecologists have ignored or diminished anecdotal historical accounts and anthropologists' reports about aboriginal fire in the Great Basin. Literature review shows that Indians practiced regular use of fire for many purposes, including the obvious reasons of increasing the availability of desired plants, maintaining habitats for animals used as food, and driving game during hunts. Historical accounts of prehistoric anthropogenic firing, inferences from fire-scar data, and data regarding annual production capability of representative sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-perennial grass ecological sites indicate that prehistoric conditions were neither fuel- nor ignition-limited. According to many sources, this "active management" by Indians was widespread, significant, and more common than lightning-caused fires, resulting in mosaic vegetation patterns that subsequently moderated the behavior of "natural fires." This interaction between Indian-burning and lightning fires may have strongly influenced the pre-Euro-American settlement vegetation of the Great Basin. At the very least, the landscape was a patchwork of areas altered by aboriginal people and areas shaped primarily by bio-physical processes. Based on this prehistoric precedent, current historically unprecedented conditions (fuel load and exotic weed invasion threats), and predicted climate change, contemporary active management of sagebrush-perennial grass communities is paramount. Restoration measures should be scientifically based and tailored to achieve ecological resilience and functionality in specific sites. Prescribed fire is not always ecologically appropriate or judicious, especially in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata spp. wyomingensis) communities, so managers should consider using other alternatives where an intentional low severity distubance is deemed necessary. Properly planned active management would disrupt fuel continuity for lighthning fires, ensure ecological process and successional integrity, and benefit multiple uses on a landscape scale.

T1  - Economic Risks of Cheatgrass Invasion on a Simulated Eastern Oregon Ranch
AN  - 1365844575
AB  - The potential of invasive plants to alter fuel properties over time has implications for the ranchers of semiarid rangelands throughout the world. A prime example of this phenomenon is the cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) invasion of the native shrub-steppe lands in Great Basin of the western United States. The purpose of this study is to develop a bioeconomic model that optimizes simulated ranch behavior given the beginning stages of cheatgrass invasion on a public forage allotment. The bioeconomic model is applied to a typical eastern Oregon 300 cow-calf ranch. Livestock production decisions are simulated over a 40-yr planning horizon using a multiperiod linear programming model. Results showed changes in profit-maximizing ranch management strategies in the form of decreased optimal stocking rates and forage substitution. The net present value of the simulated ranch's income stream declined, and the probability that the ranch cannot meet its full costs of livestock production and would exit the industry increased as a result. These economic impacts were more pronounced with decreased sale price. Sensitivity analysis showed that overall results in terms of ranch behavior were specific neither to the assumed discount rate nor to the assumed percentage of cheatgrass cover (as long as this percentage is within the reference state) on the public grazing allotment. This study introduces a method for managers to quantify impacts on ranches from fuel-altering invasive plants on public lands, emphasizing the importance of including information about native and invasive forage production characteristics and wildfire frequency as a function of the state of invasion.

T1  - Different Fire Frequency Impacts Over 27 Years on Vegetation Succession in an Infertile Old-Field Grassland
AN  - 1365844558
AB  - We examined the effect of fire on vegetation composition with the use of an experiment with four different fire frequencies (annual, 2-yr interval, 4-yr interval, and an intended control with no burning) over a 27-yr period in an infertile, old-field grassland at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, located in Minnesota, United States. We measured the plant species' aboveground biomass in permanent plots in 1983, 1987, 1991, 2000, and 2010. None of these fire frequencies, even after 27 yr, had a large impact on the vegetation composition. The plant functional groups' responses to fire frequency were consistent with their respective dominant species. The most abundant C^sub 4^ grass, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium Michx.), did not change in biomass with fire frequency over time. The biomass of the introduced, invasive grass, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) decreased significantly with increasing fire frequency, but this decrease did not result in change to the rate and trajectory of vegetation change. Bush clover (Lespedeza capitata Michx.), the only legume in the community, strongly increased with more frequent fire, but only after 20 yr. Species richness and litter mass decreased significantly with increasing fire frequency. These small fire-induced vegetation changes contrast with large fire-induced vegetation changes in fertile grasslands. Management strategies using fire in infertile grasslands can lower Poa abundance; however, increased fire also decreased overall plant diversity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Plantation forests, climate change and biodiversity
AN  - 1356654787
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Forest Biodiversity in a Changing Climate

              
Nearly 4 % of the world's forests are plantations, established to provide a variety of ecosystem services, principally timber and other wood products. In addition to such services, plantation forests provide direct and indirect benefits to biodiversity via the provision of forest habitat for a wide range of species, and by reducing negative impacts on natural forests by offsetting the need to extract resources. There is compelling evidence that climate change is directly affecting biodiversity in forests throughout the world. These impacts occur as a result of changes in temperature, rainfall, storm frequency and magnitude, fire frequency, and the frequency and magnitude of pest and disease outbreaks. However, in plantation forests it is not only the direct effects of climate change that will impact on biodiversity. Climate change will have strong indirect effects on biodiversity in plantation forests via changes in forest management actions that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the productive capacity of plantations. These include changes in species selection (including use of species mixtures), rotation length, thinning, pruning, extraction of bioenergy feedstocks, and large scale climate change driven afforestation, reforestation, and, potentially deforestation. By bringing together the potential direct and indirect impacts of climate change we conclude that in the short to medium term changes in plantation management designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change could have a significantly greater impact on biodiversity in such plantation forests than the direct effects of climate change. Although this hypothesis remains to be formally tested, forest managers worldwide are already considering new approaches to plantation forestry in an effort to create forests that are more resilient to the effects of changing climatic conditions. Such change presents significant risks to existing biodiversity values in plantation forests, however it also provides new opportunities to improve biodiversity values within existing and new plantation forests. We conclude by suggesting future options, such as functional zoning and species mixtures applied at either the stand level or as fine-scale mosaics of single-species stands as options to improve biodiversity whilst increasing resilience to climate change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of Prescribed Burns on Marsh Surface Elevation: Big Branch Marsh, Louisiana
AN  - 1434970362
AB  - This study examines the impact of prescribed burning on marsh elevation by comparing relative surface elevation change between burned and unburned control marsh plots using a Surface Elevation Table (SET) at Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge in St. Tammany Parish, LA. This project was developed in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and serves as the foundation for a long-term program for evaluating the effects of burning on marsh surface elevation. Three years after the initial burn, results indicate there was no significant difference in surface elevation change between the island receiving the burn treatment and the unburned control island. However, immediately following the burn, elevation differences between the two islands were significant, with the burn plot registering a significant decrease in elevation. The results over the course of the study might have been different had the study area not been impacted by hurricanes Faye, Gustav and Ike less than 5 months after the burn, which deposited a large amount of sediment and erased this initial deficit. These results indicate that while prescribed burning should increase vegetation density, thus increasing organic matter accumulation and potential vertical accretion, the possibility exists that the burn event will create an elevation deficit too large for those gains to overcome. This study also demonstrates the importance of storm-derived sedimentation events in the Gulf Coast marshes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Extant population of the Critically Endangered central rock-rat Zyzomys pedunculatus located in the Northern territory, Australia
AN  - 1327402451
AB  - Abstract

              
The central rock-rat Zyzomys pedunculatus is categorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. Over the last 50 years the species had only been recorded from 14 sites within a 600 km2 area of the West MacDonnell National Park and immediate surroundings in the Northern Territory, Australia. The central rock-rat disappeared from monitoring sites in 2002, coincident with the onset of drought conditions and extensive wildfires. With concern growing for the survival of the species, we sought to locate an extant population. During 2009-2012 we surveyed sites throughout the western sector of the West MacDonnell National Park, including sites where rock-rats had previously been recorded. From a total of 55 sites and 5,000 trap nights we located eight central rock-rats from only five sites (overall detection rate = 0.16 rock-rats per 100 trap nights). All sites were on two mountain-top locations, both of which are over 1,250 m altitude. Evidence of reproductive activity was observed at both locations but the subpopulations were relatively localized and no individuals were captured at any of the sites from which the species was known previous to these surveys. Although the rugged mountains may provide the central rock-rat with some refuge from predation and wildfires, more research is needed to understand better the factors suppressing and constraining the species at the population and landscape scales. Immediate management priorities are prescribed burning to limit the extent and severity of wildfires and trialling a baiting programme with 1080 to target feral cats in the mountains.

T1  - Fire Mosaics and Reptile Conservation in a Fire-Prone Region
AN  - 1318871431
AB  - Fire influences the distribution of fauna in terrestrial biomes throughout the world. Use of fire to achieve a mosaic of vegetation in different stages of succession after burning (i.e., patch-mosaic burning) is a dominant conservation practice in many regions. Despite this, knowledge of how the spatial attributes of vegetation mosaics created by fire affect fauna is extremely scarce, and it is unclear what kind of mosaic land managers should aim to achieve. We selected 28 landscapes (each 12.6 km2) that varied in the spatial extent and diversity of vegetation succession after fire in a 104,000 km2 area in the semiarid region of southeastern Australia. We surveyed for reptiles at 280 sites nested within the 28 landscapes. The landscape-level occurrence of 9 of the 22 species modeled was associated with the spatial extent of vegetation age classes created by fire. Biogeographic context and the extent of a vegetation type influenced 7 and 4 species, respectively. No species were associated with the diversity of vegetation ages within a landscape. Negative relations between reptile occurrence and both extent of recently burned vegetation (≤10 years postfire, n = 6) and long unburned vegetation (>35 years postfire, n = 4) suggested that a coarse-grained mosaic of areas (e.g. >1000 ha) of midsuccessional vegetation (11-35 years postfire) may support the fire-sensitive reptile species we modeled. This age class coincides with a peak in spinifex cover, a keystone structure for reptiles in semiarid and arid Australia. Maintaining over the long term a coarse-grained mosaic of large areas of midsuccessional vegetation in mallee ecosystems will need to be balanced against the short-term negative effects of large fires on many reptile species and a documented preference by species from other taxonomic groups, particularly birds, for older vegetation.

T1  - Forest-fire regimes affect thermoregulatory opportunities for terrestrial ectotherms
AN  - 1318510286
AB  - Fire-induced changes in canopy openness may affect sunlight penetration to the forest floor, and thus the operative temperatures available to terrestrial ectotherms. We examined thermal regimes for two types of ectotherms: diurnally active species that utilize sun-exposed patches to regulate their body temperatures, and nocturnally active species that depend upon solar radiation striking the rocks under which they shelter. We measured canopy openness, shrub height, radiation transmission and operative environmental temperatures in the open and inside reptile retreat-sites, at 24 study sites in eucalypt forests in two regions (Gosford and Yengo) in south-eastern Australia. All sites were last burnt in 2000-2001, but had experienced different fire frequencies (1-4 fires over the previous 37years). In Gosford, higher fire frequencies reduced canopy openness and radiation transmission at ground and shrub level, and thus reduced environmental temperatures and the thermal quality of reptile habitats. Our modelling based on thermal preferenda of an endangered snake species (the broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides) suggests that increased fire frequency at Gosford halved the amount of time an animal could spend within its preferred (set-point) range, regardless of whether it thermoregulated beneath rocks or basked out in the open. At Yengo, however, fire frequency did not affect the thermal quality of reptile habitats. Thus, the effects of fire frequency on forest structure and the thermal environment at ground level differed between adjacent areas, and relatively small changes in canopy openness translated into major effects on thermoregulatory opportunities for reptiles. Although fire is a useful management tool for creating open habitats, we need to understand more about the effects of fire frequency on vegetation structure and thermal environment before we can use fire to manage habitats for reptiles.

T1  - Isolation and characterisation of 36 polymorphic microsatellite markers using 454 sequencing in the bar-shouldered skink, <i>Ctenotus inornatus</i>
AN  - 2406970591
AB  - We report on the development of 36 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers from the bar-shouldered skink, Ctenotus inornatus. Members in this genus account for up to 20 % of the diverse Australian lizard species. Microsatellite markers were developed to investigate island endemism amongst Kimberley islands taxa. We describe the diversity from 110 adult Ctenotus individuals. Overall, the markers produced between 9 to 40 alleles per locus and observed and expected heterozygosities of 74.6 and 95.7 %, respectively. Due to island endemism, habitat modification by introduced grazing mammals, some urban encroachment and changes in fire regime there has been fragmentation of its range. These microsatellite markers are an important tool for evaluating population genetic information and for prioritising populations for conservation management.

T1  - Effects of Management Intervention on Post-Disturbance Community Composition: An Experimental Analysis Using Bayesian Hierarchical Models
AN  - 1330891497
AB  - As human demand for ecosystem products increases, management intervention may become more frequent after environmental disturbances. Evaluations of ecological responses to cumulative effects of management interventions and natural disturbances provide critical decision-support tools for managers who strive to balance environmental conservation and economic development. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of salvage logging on avian community composition in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks in Oregon, USA, 1996–1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only, and live trees were not harvested. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify occupancy dynamics for 27 breeding species, while accounting for variation in the detection process. We examined how magnitude and precision of treatment effects varied when incorporating prior information from a separate intervention study that occurred in a similar ecological system. Regardless of which prior we evaluated, we found no evidence that the harvest treatment had a negative impact on species richness, with an estimated average of 0.2–2.2 more species in harvested stands than unharvested stands. Estimated average similarity between control and treatment stands ranged from 0.82–0.87 (1 indicating complete similarity between a pair of stands) and suggested that treatment stands did not contain novel assemblies of species responding to the harvesting prescription. Estimated treatment effects were positive for twenty-four (90%) of the species, although the credible intervals contained 0 in all cases. These results suggest that, unlike most post-fire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the maintenance of avian community richness comparable to what is found in unharvested stands. Our results provide managers with prescription alternatives to respond to severe beetle outbreaks that continue to occur across extensive portions of the dry forests of western North America.

T1  - Grazing land management and biodiversity in the Atlantic European heathlands: a review
AN  - 1282502790
AB  - Atlantic heaths are semi-natural habitats of high biodiversity interest which once covered large areas of the Atlantic Region. Nowadays these heathlands are dramatically reduced in many countries although they still cover wide areas in the north-west Iberian Peninsula, especially in the poorest and most socially marginal areas that are frequently affected by wildfires. We review the role of livestock grazing as a sustainable management strategy for heathlands in Europe. We have worked on a generalized conceptual framework for the management of a resource of nutritional and environmental value by drawing together evidence from studies of the livestock and the community ecology of grazed plants and the associated fauna. Key factors that influence grazing impact, such as type of livestock (animal species and breed) and their management are discussed. Goats thrive better than sheep, and horses than cattle, when heathland vegetation is the predominant resource available. Regardless of the type of livestock species managed, the low nutritive value of this vegetation hinders the maintenance of productive groups of suckler dams with offspring through the grazing season. The nutritional requirements of livestock can be met by adding improved pasture areas to heathlands. Under that strategy, sheep have the best productive performance and cattle the poorest. Management of mixed flocks with goats can lead to a more efficient use of vegetation, improve productivity and develop a patchier habitat which supports a richer associated fauna. Overall the results indicate that the sustainability of livestock grazing in these marginal lands will be achieved if they are managed effectively according to the available vegetation and their effects on the biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Emerging issues and challenges in conservation of biodiversity in the rangelands of Tanzania
AN  - 2169921757
AB  - Tanzania rangelands are a stronghold for biodiversity harbouring a variety of animal and plant species of economic, ecological and socio-cultural importance. Efforts to protect these resources against destruction and loss have involved, among other things, setting aside some tracks of land as protected areas in the form of national parks, nature reserves, game reserves, game controlled and wildlife management areas. However, these areas and adjacent lands have long been subjected to a number of emerging issues and challenges, which complicate their management, thus putting the resources at risk of over exploitation and extinction. These issues and challenges include, among other things, government policies, failure of conservation (as a form of land use) to compete effectively with alternative land uses, habitat degradation and blockage of wildlife corridors, overexploitation and illegal resource extraction, wildfires, human population growth, poverty, HIV/AIDS pandemic and human-wildlife conflicts. In this paper, we review the emerging issues and challenges in biodiversity conservation by drawing experience from different parts of Tanzania. The paper is based on the premise that, understanding of the issues and challenges underpinning the rangelands is a crucial step towards setting up of plausible objectives, strategies and plans that will improve and lead to effective management of these areas. We conclude by recommending some proactive measures that may enhance the sustainability of the rangeland resources for the benefit of the current and future generations.

T1  - Return of Fire as a Restoration Tool: Long-Term Effects of Burn Severity on Habitat Use by Mexican Fox Squirrels
AN  - 1271921306
AB  - After decades of suppression, fire is returning to forests of the western United States through wildfires and prescribed burns. These fires may aid restoration of vegetation structure and processes, which could improve conditions for wildlife species and reduce severe wildfire risk. Understanding response of wildlife species to fires is essential to forest restoration because contemporary fires may not have the same effects as historical fires. Recent fires in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona provided opportunity to investigate long-term effects of burn severity on habitat selection of a native wildlife species. We surveyed burned forest for squirrel feeding sign and related vegetation characteristics to frequency of feeding sign occurrence. We used radio-telemetry within fire-influenced forest to determine home ranges of Mexican fox squirrels, Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae, and compared vegetation characteristics within home ranges to random areas available to squirrels throughout burned conifer forest. Squirrels fed in forest with open understory and closed canopy cover. Vegetation within home ranges was characterized by lower understory density, consistent with the effects of low-severity fire, and larger trees than random locations. Our results suggest that return of low-severity fire can help restore habitat for Mexican fox squirrels and other native wildlife species with similar habitat affiliations in forests with a historical regime of frequent, low-severity fire. Our study contributes to an understanding of the role and impact of fire in forest ecosystems and the implications for forest restoration as fire returns to the region. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Valuing biodiversity attributes and water supply using choice experiments: a case study of La Campana Pe?uelas Biosphere Reserve, Chile
AN  - 1266763351; 22367365
AB  - The main objective of this study is to assess public economic preferences for biodiversity conservation and water supply and to analyse the factors influencing those preferences. A survey based on the choice experiment method was carried out at Peñuelas National Reserve, Chile, an area that is threatened by both occasional forest fires and the growing housing market. The input of local administrators was used to define environmental attributes of the area related to biodiversity conservation and water supply. Attributes were selected for analysis by the choice experiment. The selected attributes were the following: existence of endemic orchid species, chances of observing animals with scenic attraction, additional protection for an endemic amphibian, and availability of drinkable water in the future. A monetary variable consisting of an increase in the rate for entry to the area was also incorporated to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for additional protection for the selected attributes. Three hundred four Chilean visitors to the reserve were randomly selected for interviews. Econometric analysis based on the Theory of Utility Maximization shows that visitors are willing to pay to protect the selected attributes. WTP values for the attributes range from CHP $2,600 ($5.4) to $6,600 ($14) per person per visit. The results of this research provide reserve managers information about tradeoffs that could be used to enhance public support and maximise the social benefits of nature conservation management programmes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relationship between habitat type, fire frequency, and Amblyomma americanum populations in east-central Alabama
AN  - 1321675585; 23181862
AB  - Ticks were collected from 20 sites in the Calhoun, Cherokee, and Cleburne Counties in east-central Alabama areas to determine the relationship between plant physiognomy, environmental variables, and tick populations. Sites investigated included various burning regimes, wildland-urban-interface (WUI), a college campus, and an unmanaged area. Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) dominated the tick population while Ixodes scapularis Say was not encountered. There were complex differences in tick populations among site conditions. After prescribed burning, the tick population size was small but was larger in subsequent 2- and 5-year post-burn sites. An increase in Odocoileus virginianus foraging in recently burned sites is likely responsible for this phenomenon. WUI areas had the largest tick populations likely due to Odocoileus virginianus activity in an area that provides cover, forage, and a connection to a wildlife refuge. It is possible that the likelihood of humans coming in contact with ticks and tick-borne diseases is greater in WUI areas than in unbroken contiguous forest. A. americanum showed a positive correlation with percent cover of grass and leaf litter mass and a negative relationship with pine sapling density. Variables expected to be strongly correlated with A. americanum populations such as soil moisture, canopy closure, and tree density were found to have weak correlations.

T1  - Threatened mammals become more predatory after small-scale prescribed fires in a high-rainfall rocky savanna
AN  - 1178955335
AB  - Understanding mechanisms underlying fire regime effects on savanna fauna is difficult because of a wide range of possible trophic interactions and feedbacks. Yet, understanding mechanisms underlying fauna dynamics is crucial for conservation management of threatened species. Small savanna mammals in northern Australia are currently undergoing widespread declines and regional extinctions partly attributable to fire regimes. This study investigates mammal trophic and ecosystem responses to fire in order to identify possible mechanisms underlying these declines. Mammal trophic responses to fire were investigated by surveying mammal abundance, mammal diet, vegetation structure and non-mammal fauna dynamics in savannas six times at eight sites over a period of 3years. Known site-specific fire history was used to test for trophic responses to post-fire interval and fire frequency. Mammal and non-mammal fauna showed only minor responses of post-fire interval and no effect of fire frequency. Lack of fauna responses differed from large post-fire vegetation responses. Dietary analysis showed that two mammal species, Dasyurus hallucatus and Isoodon auratus, increased their intake of large prey groups in recently burnt, compared to longer unburnt vegetation. This suggests a fire-related change in trophic interactions among predators and their prey, after removal of ground-layer vegetation. No evidence was found for other changes in food resource uptake by mammals after fire. These data provide support for a fire-related top-down ecosystem response among savanna mammals, rather than a bottom-up resource limitation response. Future studies need to investigate fire responses among other predators, including introduced cats and dingoes, to determine their roles in fire-related mammal declines in savannas of northern Australia.

T1  - Relative influence of habitat structure, species interactions and rainfall on the post-fire population dynamics of ground-dwelling vertebrates
AN  - 1178954579
AB  - The long-term impacts of wildfires on animal populations are largely unknown. We used time-series data based on a tracking index, from coastal NSW spanning 28years after a wildfire, to investigate the relative influence of habitat structure, species interactions and climate on post-fire animal population dynamics. The fire had an immediate impact on habitat structure, reducing and simplifying vegetation cover, which then underwent post-fire successional change including an increase and plateau in tree canopy cover; an increase, stabilization and then decline in shrub cover; and an increase in ground litter cover. Population changes of different animal species were influenced by different components of successional change, but there was also evidence that species interactions were important. For example, bandicoots (Isoodon obesulus and Perameles nasuta combined) increased concurrent with an increase in shrub cover then declined at a faster rate than a direct association with senescing shrub cover would suggest, while the feral cat (Felis catus) population changed with the bandicoot population, suggesting a link between these species. Potoroos (Potorous tridactylus) increased 10years after the fire concurrent with the closing tree canopy, but there was also evidence of a negative association with feral foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Variation in rainfall did not have significant effects on the population dynamics of any species. Our results suggest that changes in habitat structure play a key role in the post-fire dynamics of many ground-dwelling animals and hence different fire regimes are likely to influence animal dynamics through their effects on habitat structure. However, the role of predator-prey interactions, particularly with feral predators, is less clear and further study will require manipulative experiments of predators in conjunction with fire treatments to determine whether feral predator control should be integrated with fire management to improve outcomes for some native species.

T1  - Disturbance factors influencing greater sage-grouse lek abandonment in north-central Wyoming
AN  - 1420279678
AB  - Detecting the disappearance of active leks is the most efficient way to determine large declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations; thus, understanding factors that influence lek abandonment is critical. We evaluated factors that may have influenced the probability of sage-grouse lek abandonment in the Bighorn Basin (BHB) of north-central Wyoming from 1980 to 2009. Our objective was to examine lek abandonment based on landscape characteristics that explain differences between occupied and unoccupied leks. We evaluated lek abandonment from 144 occupied and 39 unoccupied leks from the Wyoming Game and Fish Department lek database with sufficient data for our 30-year analysis. We conducted our analysis with binary logistic regression using landscape predictor variables obtained from geographic coverages at 5 scales (1.0-, 3.2-, 4.0-, 5.0-, and 6.4-km radii around leks) to evaluate how these disturbances have influenced lek abandonment. Coverages included anthropogenic characteristics such as agricultural development, oil and gas development, prescribed burned treatments, and roads; and environmental characteristics such as vegetation attributes and wildfire. Our combined model included the number of oil and gas wells in a 1.0-km radius, percent area of wildfire in a 1.0-km radius, and variability in shrub height in a 1.0-km radius around sage-grouse leks. Abandoned (unoccupied) leks had 1.1-times the variability of shrub height in a 1.0-km radius, 3.1-times the percentage of wildfire in a 1.0-km radius, and 10.3-times the number of oil and gas wells in a 1.0-km radius compared to occupied leks. The model-averaged odds of lek persistence with every 1 unit increase in oil and gas wells within a 1.0-km radius was 0.66 (90% CI: 0.37-0.94), odds with every 1% increase in wildfire in a 1.0-km radius was 0.99 (90% CI: 0.85-1.12), and odds with every 1 unit increase in the standard deviation of shrub height within a 1.0-km radius around a lek was 0.77 (90% CI: 0.45-1.08). Because the 90% confidence intervals around the odds ratios of wells did not overlap 1.0, we suggest this predictor variable was most influential in our model-averaged estimates. The BHB has lower developed reserves of oil and gas than many other regions; however, our study supports findings from other studies that demonstrate energy development increases lek abandonment. Our findings indicate conservation efforts should be focused on minimizing well development and implementing wildfire suppression tactics near active sage-grouse leks. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Post‐fire salvage logging alters a key plant‐animal interaction for forest regeneration
AN  - 2299128669
AB  - Post‐fire salvage logging is widely implemented worldwide, but there is an increasing concern about its potential impact on the ecosystem. Moreover, there is scant information about the effect of salvage logging on ecosystem processes mediated by species interactions. We manipulated a burnt pine forest to experimentally analyze the effect of burnt‐wood management on the colonization of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) mediated by acorn dispersal by Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius). Three replicates of three treatments were established in an 18‐ha plot: salvage logging (SL), non‐intervention (NI), and partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass in situ). We hypothesized that different burnt‐wood management could alter jays' landscape perception and thus the pattern of seed dispersal and seedling recruitment. We monitored jay abundance in each treatment for three winters and three breeding periods, and jay flights of potential acorn dispersal between nearby oak trees and the treatments. We also searched for oak seedlings recruited in the experimental plot for five years following the fire. Jays were recorded significantly more times (87%) in NI, and movements to this treatment during the acorn dispersal period were also more frequent (81% of the flights). Oak seedlings were also more abundant in NI (ca. 55%) than in SL or PCL (ca. 25% each), despite a strong effect of small remnants of live pines. The results show that the burnt forest, if unsalvaged, still provides a suitable habitat for jays, while salvage logging reduces the strength of this key plant‐animal interaction for oak natural regeneration. Non‐intervention policies after a forest fire therefore provide the opportunity for adaptive management that helps reduce restoration costs and increase the resilience of the system.

T1  - Can the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and information on species traits predict anuran responses to fire?
AN  - 1038934276
AB  - Fire is a common form of recurrent disturbance in many ecosystems, but ecological theory has a poor record of predicting animal responses to fire, at both species and assemblage levels. As a consequence, there is limited information to guide fire regime management for biodiversity conservation. We investigated a key research gap in the fire ecology literature; that is, the response of an anuran assemblage to variation in the fire return interval. We tested two hypotheses using a spatially-explicit fire database collected over a 40 year period: 1) species richness would peak at intermediate levels of disturbance. 2) Species with traits which enabled them to escape fire - burrowing or canopy dwelling - would be better able to survive fires, resulting in higher levels of occurrence in frequently burned sites. We found no evidence for either a reduction in species richness at locations with short fire return intervals, or a peak in species richness at intermediate levels of disturbance. Although we found some support for individual species responses to fire return intervals, these were inconsistent with the interpretation of burrowing or climbing being functional traits for fire-avoidance. Instead burrowing and climbing species may be more likely to be disadvantaged by frequent fire than surface dwelling frogs. More generally, our results show that many species in our study system have persisted despite a range of fire frequencies, and therefore that active management of fire regimes for anuran persistence may be unnecessary. The responses of anurans to fire in this location are unlikely to be predictable using simple life-history traits. Future work should focus on understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of fire responses, by integrating information on animal behavior and species' ecological requirements. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Consequences of Treating Wyoming Big Sagebrush to Enhance Wildlife Habitats
AN  - 1151085044
AB  - Sagebrush (Artemisia L.) taxa historically functioned as the keystone species on 1 090 000 km^sup 2^ of rangeland across the western United States, and Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and Young) is or was dominant on a substantial amount of this landscape. Wyoming big sagebrush provides habitat for numerous wildlife species. Nevertheless, Wyoming big sagebrush communities are commonly manipulated to decrease shrub cover and density and increase the productivity and diversity of herbaceous plants. We examined relationships between management-directed changes in Wyoming big sagebrush and greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), species commonly associated with these ecosystems. We focused on herbicide applications, mechanical treatments, and prescribed burning, because they are commonly applied to large areas in big sagebrush communities, often with the goal to improve wildlife habitats. Specifically, our objective was to identify treatments that either enhance or imperil sagebrush habitats for these wildlife species. The preponderance of literature indicates that habitat management programs that emphasize treating Wyoming big sagebrush are not supported with respect to positive responses by sage-grouse habitats or populations. There is less empirical information on ungulate habitat response to Wyoming big sagebrush treatments, but the value of sagebrush as cover and food to these species is clearly documented. A few studies suggest small-scale treatments (≤60-m width) in mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana [Rydb.] Beetle) may create attractive foraging conditions for brooding sage-grouse, but these may have little relevance to Wyoming big sagebrush. Recommendations or management programs that emphasize treatments to reduce Wyoming big sagebrush could lead to declines of wildlife species. More research is needed to evaluate the response of sagebrush wildlife habitats and populations to treatments, and until that time, managers should refrain from applying them in Wyoming big sagebrush communities.

T1  - Conserving and promoting evenness: organic farming and fire-based wildland management as case studies
AN  - 1081710060
AB  - Healthy ecosystems include many species (high richness) with similar abundances (high evenness). Thus, both aspects of biodiversity are worthy of conservation. Simultaneously conserving richness and evenness might be difficult, however, if, for example, the restoration of previously absent species to low densities brings a cost in reduced evenness. Using meta-analysis, we searched for benefits to biodiversity following adoption of two common land-management schemes: the implementation of organic practices by farmers and of controlled burning by natural-land managers. We used rarefaction to eliminate sampling bias in all of our estimates of richness and evenness. Both conservation practices significantly increased evenness and overall abundance across taxonomic classifications (arthropods, birds, non-bird vertebrates, plants, soil organisms). Evenness and richness varied independently, leading to no richness-evenness correlation and no significant overall change in richness. Demonstrating the importance of rarefaction, analyses of raw data that did not receive rarefaction indicated misleadingly strong benefits of organic agriculture and burning for richness while underestimating true gains in evenness. Both organic farming and burning favored species that were not numerically dominant, re-balancing communities as uncommon species gained individuals. Our results support the assertion that richness and evenness capture separate facets of biodiversity, each needing individual attention during conservation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Bayesian Approach to Landscape Ecological Risk Assessment Applied to the Upper Grande Ronde Watershed, Oregon
AN  - 1081162015
AB  - We present a Bayesian network model based on the ecological risk assessment framework to evaluate potential impacts to habitats and resources resulting from wildfire, grazing, forest management activities, and insect outbreaks in a forested landscape in northeastern Oregon. The Bayesian network structure consisted of three tiers of nodes: landscape disturbances, habitats, and the ecological resources or endpoints of interest to land managers. Nodes at each tier were linked to lower nodes if ecological and spatial relationships existed between them. All parameters had four potential discrete states: zero, low, medium, and high. Our model reliably predicted probable risk to habitats and endpoints from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The disturbances most likely to transform habitats and effect ecological resources were forest management and wildfire. Of the six habitats, moist forest (characterized by Douglas fir and grand fir) was found to be at greatest risk of ecological impacts. The management endpoint with the highest likelihood of impact was historical range of variability (HRV) for salmon habitat, followed by recreation (hunting native ungulates) and HRV wildfire. We found that the Bayesian approach to ecological risk assessment was a useful method to assess potential impacts to ecological resources resulting from forest management and natural disturbances.

T1  - Post-fire salvage logging increases restoration costs in a Mediterranean mountain ecosystem
AN  - 1037269178
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Restoring Forests: Advances in Techniques and Theory

              
Post-fire salvage logging (i.e. felling and removing burnt trees, often eliminating the remaining woody debris) is a practice routinely performed by forest managers worldwide. In Mediterranean-type ecosystems, salvage logging is considered a measure to reduce future reforestation costs, but this assumption remains largely untested. We made a cost analysis of different management schemes, addressing the immediate post-fire burnt-wood management as well as the costs and success of subsequent reforestation efforts. Two experimental 25-ha plots were established in a burnt pine reforestation of SE Spain, in which three replicates of three post-fire treatments were applied: non-intervention (NI), partial cut plus lopping (PCL; felling and lopping off the branches from most of the trees, leaving all biomass in situ), and salvage logging (SL). After 4 years, a mechanised reforestation was undertaken, and seedling mortality was monitored for 2 years. The cost of all management operations was recorded in situ, and the cost of re-planting the dead seedlings was estimated according to the expenses of previous reforestation. Initial cost of wood management was greatest in SL and zero in NI. Reforestation cost was highest in NI and lowest in SL, and seedling-mortality rates proved lowest in PCL (43 % vs. 51 % and 52 % in SL and NI, respectively). Considering all the post-fire management operations, salvage logging did not provide particular economic advantages for forest restoration, and had an overall cost of 3,436 ± 340 [euro]/ha. By contrast, NI and PCL reduced total restoration costs by 50 and 35 %, respectively, and PCL indeed promoted restoration success. We suggest that the full cost of management operations needs to be considered when evaluating the economic implications of post-fire salvage logging.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Spatial Variability in Cost and Success of Revegetation in a Wyoming Big Sagebrush Community
AN  - 1032637347; 22773069
AB  - The ecological integrity of the Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle and A. Young) alliance is being severely interrupted by post-fire invasion of non-native annual grasses. To curtail this invasion, successful post-fire revegetation of perennial grasses is required. Environmental factors impacting post-fire restoration success vary across space within the Wyoming big sagebrush alliance; however, most restorative management practices are applied uniformly. Our objectives were to define probability of revegetation success over space using relevant soil-related environmental factors, use this information to model cost of successful revegetation and compare the importance of vegetation competition and soil factors to revegetation success. We studied a burned Wyoming big sagebrush landscape in southeast Oregon that was reseeded with perennial grasses. We collected soil and vegetation data at plots spaced at 30 m intervals along a 1.5 km transect in the first two years post-burn. Plots were classified as successful (>5 seedlings/m^sup 2^) or unsuccessful based on density of seeded species. Using logistic regression we found that abundance of competing vegetation correctly predicted revegetation success on 51 % of plots, and soil-related variables correctly predicted revegetation performance on 82.4 % of plots. Revegetation estimates varied from $167.06 to $43,033.94/ha across the 1.5 km transect based on probability of success, but were more homogenous at larger scales. Our experimental protocol provides managers with a technique to identify important environmental drivers of restoration success and this process will be of value for spatially allocating logistical and capital expenditures in a variable restoration environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of salvage logging of beetle-killed forests on avian species and foraging guild abundance
AN  - 1420277617
AB  - Evaluating spatial and temporal variation in abundance due to anthropogenic and environmental disturbances is a central aspect of wildlife ecology and management. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of salvage logging on the abundance of 22 avian species and 6 foraging guilds in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks, south-central Oregon, USA, 1996-1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only; live trees and ponderosa pine snags were not harvested. Our hierarchical model requires replicated count data from multiple sample units across several time periods, during which the population is closed, to estimate abundance as a function of logging treatment and management district while accounting for imperfect and variable detection probability. We fit the model to point counts from 12 control and 12 treatment plots with 3 surveys during each breeding season, 1996-1998. We found evidence for a large, but imprecise, effect of salvage logging in all 3 years for only 1 species, the gray flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii). The abundance of the remaining species either did not change or displayed weak positive responses to the treatment. Although 3 foraging guilds increased in total abundance, 2 guilds did not change and the response of 1 guild changed direction in different years. Our results suggest that, unlike most postfire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the maintenance of avian population sizes comparable to those found in unharvested stands. Future research should consider different sampling programs for those species with large home ranges (e.g., woodpeckers) that may not be sampled adequately using commonly employed programs (e.g., point count stations). © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

T1  - Managing the long-term persistence of a rare cockatoo under climate change
AN  - 1030270669
AB  - Linked demographic-bioclimatic models are emerging tools for forecasting climate change impacts on well-studied species, but these methods have been used in few management applications, and species interactions have not been incorporated. We combined population and bioclimatic envelope models to estimate future risks to the viability of a cockatoo population posed by climate change, increased fire frequency, beak-and-feather disease and reduced management. The South Australian glossy black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus is restricted to Kangaroo Island, Australia, where it numbers 350 birds and is managed intensively. The cockatoo may be at particular risk from climate change because of its insular geographic constraints and specialised diet on a single plant species, Allocasuarina verticillata. The cockatoo population model was parameterised with mark-resight-derived estimates of survival and fecundity from 13 years of demographic data. Species interactions were incorporated by using a climate-change-driven bioclimatic model of Allocasuarina verticillata as a dynamic driver of habitat suitability. A novel application of Latin Hypercube sampling was used to assess the model's sensitivity to input parameters. Results suggest that unmitigated climate change is likely to be a substantial threat for the cockatoo: all high-CO2-concentration scenarios had expected minimum abundances of <160 birds. Extinction was virtually certain if management of nest-predating brush-tail possums Trichosurus vulpecula was stopped, or adult survival reduced by as little as 5%. In contrast, the population is predicted to increase under low-emissions scenarios. Disease outbreak, increased fire frequency and reductions in revegetation and management of competitive little corellas Cacatua sanguinea, were all predicted to exacerbate decline, but these effects were buffered by the cockatoo population's high fecundity. Spatial correlates of extinction risk, such as range area and total habitat suitability, were nonlinearly related to projected population size in the high-CO2-concentration scenario. Mechanistic demographic-bioclimatic simulations that incorporate species interactions can provide more detailed viability analyses than traditional bioclimatic models and be used to rank the cost-effectiveness of management interventions. Our results highlight the importance of managing possum predation and maintaining high adult cockatoo survival. In contrast, corella and revegetation management could be experimentally reduced to save resources.

T1  - A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Common Management Actions on the Nest Success of North American Birds; Un Meta-Análisis de los Efectos de Acciones de Manejo Comunes Sobre el Éxito de Anidación de Aves de Norte América
AN  - 1026848866
AB  - Abstract:  Management strategies for the recovery of declining bird populations often must be made without sufficient data to predict the outcome of proposed actions or sufficient time and resources necessary to collect these data. We quantitatively reviewed studies of bird management in Canada and the United States to evaluate the relative efficacy of 4 common management interventions and to determine variables associated with their success. We compared how livestock exclusion, prescribed burning, removal of predators, and removal of cowbirds (Molothrus ater) affect bird nest success and used meta-regression to evaluate the influence of species and study-specific covariates on management outcomes. On average, all 4 management interventions increased nest success. When common species and threatened, endangered, or declining species (as defined by long-term trend data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey) were analyzed together, predator removal was the most effective management option. The difference in mean nest success between treatment and control plots in predator-removal experiments was more than twice that of either livestock exclusion or prescribed burning. However, when we considered management outcomes from only threatened, endangered, or declining species, livestock exclusions resulted in the greatest mean increase in nest success, more than twice that of the 3 other treatments. Our meta-regression results indicated that between-species variation accounted for approximately 86%, 40%, 35%, and 7% of the overall variation in the results of livestock-exclusion, prescribed-burn, predator-removal, and cowbird-removal studies, respectively. However, the covariates we tested explained significant variation only in outcomes among prescribed-burn studies. The difference in nest success between burned and unburned plots displayed a significant, positive trend in association with time since fire and was significantly larger in grasslands than in woodlands. Our results highlight the importance of comparative studies on management effects in developing efficient and effective conservation strategies.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Outplanting but not seeding establishes native desert perennials
AN  - 1082452200
AB  - Developing reliable techniques for revegetating disturbed arid lands is challenging. Few studies have directly compared effectiveness of the 2 main revegetation techniques--seeding and outplanting--and the relationship to various treatments intended to enhance plant establishment. We compared seeding and planting and evaluated granivory protection, irrigation, and shelter treatments with a range of native perennial species monitored for 3 y on a wildfire site in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada. Contrasted with previous studies in the Mojave Desert, seeding failed to establish new plants, despite protecting seeds from small mammal granivory, irrigating, and using seeds known to be viable during a study period that included a mix of moist and dry years. Outplanting, however resulted in third-year survival ≥ 22% for 4 of 10 species. The best-performing species and their survival included desert globemallow (Sphaeralcea ambigua A. Gray [Malvaceae]; 55%), Eastern Mojave buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum Benth. [Polygonaceae]; 28%), white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa (A. Gray) Payne [Asteraceae]; 23%), and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Coville [Zygophyllaceae]; 23%). Adding either water or shelter approximately doubled survival. Surviving the first year appeared critical to success, as outplants healthy at year 1 remained alive at year 3. Although outplanting is often considered inferior for introducing propagules to larger areas in comparison with seeding, a finding that 86% of Sphaeralcea and 73% of Eriogonum survivors were flowering suggests that potential seed production by the outplants should not be dismissed. Results suggest that outplanting native perennials can revegetate desert disturbances, especially if early survival can be increased. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of Seed Predation by Mice on Wild Lupine in and near Oak Savannas
AN  - 1027226473
AB  - Wild blue lupine (Lupinus perennis) in the Oak Openings Region of Northwest Ohio is an important nitrogen fixer and serves as an essential food source for the federally endangered Karner Blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis). In order to examine potential factors that might be affecting mice predation on wild blue lupine seeds in oak savannas, we used seed trays placed in the open or on the forested edge to estimate seed predation rate. We recorded management histories, performed vegetation surveys, and used GIS to find spatial variables related to prescribed burning and edge to assess how they affect seed predation. Our major findings were that seed removal by mice for the summer averaged across sites was 22%, seed removal varied significantly across time (P < 0.05), and was more likely in areas with increased crypto-biotic crust (P < 0.0001). Seed predation rates increased under more prescribed burns over the last 10 y (P = 0.034) and 19 years (P = 0.0001). This leads us to support current management practices of a rotation of prescribed burning in open to partially closed canopy areas to create a balance between promoting lupine growth and minimal seed predation.

T1  - Roads Impact the Distribution of Noxious Weeds More Than Restoration Treatments in a Lodgepole Pine Forest in Montana, U.S.A.
AN  - 1023186047
AB  - A century of fire suppression has created unnaturally dense stands in many western North American forests, and silviculture treatments are being increasingly used to reduce fuels to mitigate wildfire hazards and manage insect infestations. Thinning prescriptions have the potential to restore forests to a more historically sustainable state, but land managers need to be aware of the potential impacts of such treatments on invasion by exotic plants. However, the effects of these activities on the introduction and spread of invasive plants are not well understood. We evaluated noxious weed occurrence over a 9-year period (2001-2009) following thinning and burning treatments in a lodgepole pine forest in central Montana. Surveys were made in the treatment units and along roads for two shelterwood-with-reserve prescriptions, each with and without prescribed burning, burned only, and untreated controls. Five species listed as noxious weeds in Montana were recorded: spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), and houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale). With the exception of Canada thistle, noxious weeds were confined to roadsides and did not colonize silvicultural treatment areas. Roadside habitats contributed more to the distribution of noxious plant species than did silvicultural treatments in this relatively uninvaded forest, indicating the importance of weed control tactics along roads and underscoring the need to mitigate exotic plant dispersal by motorized vehicles. In addition, these findings suggest that roadways should be considered when evaluating the potential for invasion and spread of exotic plants following forest restoration treatments.

T1  - Aboriginal hunting buffers climate-driven fire-size variability in Australia's spinifex grasslands
AN  - 1022477420
AB  - Across diverse ecosystems, greater climatic variability tends to increase wildfire size, particularly in Australia, where alternating wet-dry cycles increase vegetation growth, only to leave a dry overgrown landscape highly susceptible to fire spread. Aboriginal Australian hunting fires have been hypothesized to buffer such variability, mitigating mortality on small-mammal populations, which have suffered declines and extinctions in the arid zone coincident with Aboriginal depopulation. We test the hypothesis that the relationship between climate and fire size is buffered through the maintenance of an anthropogenic, fine-grained fire regime by comparing the effect of climatic variability on landscapes dominated by Martu Aboriginal hunting fires with those dominated by lightning fires. We show that Aboriginal fires are smaller, more tightly clustered, and remain small even when climate variation causes huge fires in the lightning region. As these effects likely benefit threatened small-mammal species, Aboriginal hunters should be considered trophic facilitators, and policies aimed at reducing the risk of large fires should promote land-management strategies consistent with Aboriginal burning regimes.

T1  - Characteristics of climate and landscape disturbance influence the dynamics of greater sage‐grouse populations
AN  - 2299130064
AB  - Life histories determine how organisms interact with their environment and predict how populations respond to environmental change. Understanding relationships between life histories and environmental variability is therefore crucial for effective conservation under changing environmental conditions. Greater sage‐grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of major conservation concern in western North America following widespread disturbance of the sagebrush ecosystems to which they are endemic. Using robust design and Pradel capture‐mark‐recapture models, we evaluated the influence of climatic processes and disturbance associated with post‐wildfire exotic grass invasion on annual survival, per‐capita recruitment, and population growth of breeding male sage‐grouse in eastern Nevada, USA. Climatic processes, indexed by annual rainfall and maximum summertime temperatures, had a strong relationship with recruitment and adult survival, respectively. The range of variation in recruitment during the study was greater than the range of variation in survival, consistent with a life‐history strategy that features lengthened lifespan to capitalize on periodically favorable reproductive conditions. Annual variation in precipitation variables (e.g., rainfall or snow depth) explained as much as 75% of the annual variance in population size during the study. Our results are consistent with bottom‐up regulation of sage‐grouse populations, where abundance is determined in large part by climate‐driven variation in resource availability. Exotic grasslands had a negative influence on recruitment that was interactive with annual rainfall; recruitment was consistently low in areas with a substantial exotic grassland footprint even following years of favorable rainfall. We found males breeding at leks with substantial exotic grassland impacts had lower annual survival compared to males at leks surrounded by native sagebrush habitats. However, models containing an interaction between exotic grasslands and maximum summer temperature were not clearly superior to models that considered only additive effects of the two variables. This research has significant implications for sage‐grouse persistence in a changing climate, where more frequent drought and increased spread of exotic grasslands will have negative impacts on sage‐grouse populations.

T1  - Combining community-level spatial modelling and expert knowledge to inform climate adaptation in temperate grassy eucalypt woodlands and related grasslands
AN  - 1461753315
AB  - Many studies predict effects of future climate scenarios on species distributions, but few predict impacts on landscapes or ecological communities, the scales most relevant to conservation management. We combined expert knowledge with community-level spatial modelling (using artificial neural networks, ANN, and generalised dissimilarity modelling, GDM) to inform climate adaptation management in widespread but highly threatened temperate grassy ecosystems (TGE) of Australian agricultural landscapes. GDM predicted high levels of 'biotically-scaled environmental stress' (scaled in terms of potential change in species composition of communities) for plants, reptiles and snails within the TGE under medium, and especially high, 2070 climate scenarios. Predicted stress was lower for birds, mammals and frogs, possibly owing to generally wider species distributions, but these models do not account for changing habitat characteristics. ANN predicted environments within the current TGE biome will become increasingly favourable for formations such as chenopod shrublands, Casuarina L. forests and Callitris Vent. forests by 2070, although classification error for eucalypt woodland in current climates was high. Expert knowledge and GDM suggest these predictions may be mediated by attributes such as environmental heterogeneity that confer resilience, but GDM confirms that widespread degradation has greatly compromised the capacity of TGE to adapt to change. Based on model predictions and expert knowledge we discuss five potential climate change outcomes for TGE: decreasing fire frequency, structural change, altered functional composition, exotic invasion, and cascading changes in ecological interactions. Although significant ecological change in TGE is likely, it is feasible to ameliorate non-climatic limits to adaptation and promote reassembly by native rather than exotic species. Current conservation efforts already target similar goals, and reinforcing and adjusting these approaches offer the highest priority, lowest risk climate adaptation options. We conclude that despite high uncertainties, combining community-level modelling with expert knowledge can guide climate adaptation management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities in Mediterranean pine forests: the benefits for declining species
AN  - 1019436173
AB  - Postfire salvage logging is the most commonly applied forestry practice in burned forests world-wide, mainly for economic reasons. However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes. Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. We surveyed breeding birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird community during the first three springs after fire. Most bird species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to the third. Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species, although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range of species.

T1  - Is the reassembly of an arid spider assemblage following fire deterministic?
AN  - 1015450275
AB  - Fire is a common disturbance in many ecosystems, including arid Australia. Understanding whether fauna respond in a deterministic manner towards a single end-point, or to multiple states, is of crucial importance for conservation management. Why different taxa or assemblages display single or multiple end-points is also important to develop a synthetic theory of succession. To examine the post-fire changes in assemblages of spiders, we established a chronosequence study in spinifex habitat of central Western Australia. Ground-active spiders were pitfall-trapped over nine months in sites representing experimental fires (0 and 0.5years post-fire) and wildfires (3, 5, 8 and 20years post-fire). There were significant non-linear changes in species richness, evenness and composition of spiders with increasing post-fire age. For all three measures, the assemblage appeared highly deterministic, converging towards the long unburnt state. Similarity in richness, evenness and species composition to the 20-year-old sites all increased with increasing time since fire (3-8years). However, experimentally burnt sites did not neatly fit this sequence. We consider two alternative hypotheses to explain this second trajectory: inertia within the system or the rapid migration and recolonization from nearby surrounding unburnt areas. Analyses indicated that half of the 179 species had significant preferences for, or were restricted to, particular post-fire ages. This suggests that adequate pyrodiversity, both in terms of post-fire ages and/or scale and intensity of fires, may be important for the conservation of spiders in this habitat. However, owing to the high number of singletons and low indicator values, the significance of this result for conservation management remains equivocal. Despite this, the high degree of determinism provides hope that managers can develop a good predictive understanding of post-fire successional changes in spider assemblages in arid Australia.

T1  - Reptile responses to fire and the risk of post-disturbance sampling bias
AN  - 1013463802
AB  - Altered fire regimes are a driver of biodiversity decline. To plan effective management, we need to know how species are influenced by fire and to develop theory describing fire responses. Animal responses to fire are usually measured using methods that rely on animal activity, but animal activity may vary with time since fire, potentially biasing results. Using a novel approach for detecting bias in the pit-fall trap method, we found that leaf-litter dependent reptiles were more active up to 6 weeks after fire, giving a misleading impression of abundance. This effect was not discovered when modelling detectability with zero-inflated binomial models. Two species without detection bias showed early-successional responses to time since fire, consistent with a habitat-accommodation succession model. However, a habitat specialist did not have the predicted low abundance after fire due to increased post-fire movement and non-linear recovery of a key habitat component. Interactions between fire and other processes therefore must be better understood to predict reptile responses to changing fire-regimes. We conclude that there is substantial bias when trapping reptiles after fire, with species that are otherwise hard to detect appearing to be abundant. Studies that use a survey method based on animal activity such as bird calls or animal movements, likely face a similar risk of bias when comparing recently-disturbed with control sites.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Landscape-scale effects of fire on bird assemblages: does pyrodiversity beget biodiversity?
AN  - 963965093
AB  - Aim A common strategy for conserving biodiversity in fire-prone environments is to maintain a diversity of post-fire age classes at the landscape scale, under the assumption that 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity'. Another strategy is to maintain extensive areas of a particular seral state regarded as vital for the persistence of threatened species, under the assumption that this will also cater for the habitat needs of other species. We investigated the likely effects of these strategies on bird assemblages in tree mallee vegetation, characterized by multi-stemmed Eucalyptus species, where both strategies are currently employed.              Location The semi-arid Murray Mallee region of south-eastern Australia.              Methods We systematically surveyed birds in 26 landscapes (each 4-km diameter), selected to represent gradients in the diversity of fire age classes and the proportion of older vegetation (>35years since fire). Additional variables were measured to represent underlying vegetation- or fire-mediated properties of the landscape, as well as its biogeographic context. We used an information-theoretic approach to investigate the relationships between these predictor variables and the species richness of birds (total species, threatened species and rare species).              Results Species richness of birds was not strongly associated with fire-mediated heterogeneity. Species richness was associated with increasing amounts of older vegetation in landscapes, but not with the proportion of recently burned vegetation in landscapes.              Main conclusions The preference of many mallee birds for older vegetation highlights the risk of a blanket application of the 'pyrodiversity begets biodiversity' paradigm. If application of this paradigm involved converting large areas from long unburned to recently burned vegetation to increase fire-mediated heterogeneity in tree mallee landscapes, our findings suggest that this could threaten birds. This research highlights the value of adopting a landscape-scale perspective when evaluating the utility of fire-management strategies intended to benefit biodiversity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Female White-Tailed Deer Body Condition and Diet After a Large Spring Wildfire
AN  - 1022703806
AB  - Frequency of large rangeland wildfires may increase in the southwestern United States and northeastern Mexico as a result of exotic grass invasion and reduced emphasis on livestock production, but effects of such fires on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are poorly documented. A large wildfire burned >90% of the 6 151-ha Chaparral Wildlife Management Area in southern Texas during March 2008, creating an opportunity to study short-term effects of wildfire on white-tailed deer food habits, body condition, and pregnancy. We harvested 26 female deer between 7 April and 20 June 2008 and recorded dressed body weight, body condition, number of corpora lutea, and number and size of fetuses. We used rumen contents to quantify forage classes consumed. Deer ate prickly pear (Opuntia engelmannii) pads and emergent grasses during April and shifted to forbs and browse as vegetation communities recovered. Deer consumed mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) beans and prickly pear fruit during mid-June. Body condition measures did not vary during the collection period, suggesting deer were able to acquire sufficient nutrients to meet requirements. Fetal development rate appeared normal. Precipitation (11.4 cm) during late April and May probably allowed vegetation to recover from the wildfire. White-tailed deer are resilient opportunists and were able to maintain body condition and pregnancy after a large-scale wildfire. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Foraging-Habitat Selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers in Forest Burns of Southwestern Idaho
AN  - 1020582537
AB  - We examined foraging-habitat selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus ) in burned forests of southwestern Idaho during 2000 and 2002 (6 and 8 years following wildfire). This woodpecker responds positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years.

T1  - Contributions of Private Landowners to the Conservation of the Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)
AN  - 962460197; 22371129
AB  - Private landowners play a pivotal role in determining whether or not rare species persist in regions where privately owned land is extensive. The range of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is confined to the Southeastern U.S., a region predominantly under private ownership, and thus the status of this species is largely dependent upon land management decisions made by private landowners. We sent an anonymous mail survey to 2,584 individuals to examine factors affecting gopher tortoise occurrence on private lands in Mississippi (adjusted response rate of 23%). Few respondents (19%) reported currently having tortoises on their property, although many had them in the past (30%). Tortoises were persisting primarily on larger properties with longleaf pine that were not managed chiefly for timber production. In general, respondents were largely unaware of habitat requirements of tortoises or effects of various land management practices on them, and few reported using management techniques that benefit tortoises, such as prescribed burning. Most respondents (57%) knew of wildlife incentive programs, but were hesitant to enroll because they did not want to commit to managing their property in a particular manner (34%). We suggest actions that could improve the likelihood of tortoise persistence in this region, as well as changes that could be made to incentive programs to increase landowner participation. These suggestions should be relevant to the conservation of other rare species on private lands in other regions.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Habitat Selection and Use of Space by Bald-Faced Sakis (Pithecia irrorata) in Southwestern Amazonia: Lessons from a Multiyear, Multigroup Study
AN  - 940505909
AB  - Population density and distribution in tropical forest vertebrates are directly linked to patterns of use of space relative to habitat structure and composition. To examine how forest type may explain the ranging behavior and high variance in group density observed within the geographic range of bald-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia irrorata), we monitored habitat use of 5 neighboring focal groups of this species in southwestern Amazonia over 3 yr. To test whether sakis are unflooded (terra firme) forest specialists, we compared home range (HR) use to the corresponding availability of 4 main forest types and quantified HR size and activity budgets as a function of forest type. HR size varied from 16 to 60 ha, and saki population density at this scale (12.5±6.4 SD individuals/km^sup 2^) was more closely related to forest type than to group size. Although sakis were not obligate habitat specialists, groups clearly avoided bamboo forest and preferred terra firme forest. Terra firme forests were associated with small HRs, intensive use, high HR overlap, and territorial defense, all of which suggest that saki densities will be higher in areas dominated by terra firme forest where large patches of bamboo (Guadua spp.) are absent. The increased desiccation and subsequent forest fires expected in this region from the combined impacts of climate change and human land use potentially threaten the long-term viability of old-growth terra firme forest specialists such as sakis. Regional-scale conservation efforts should ensure that extensive blocks of terra firme forest are protected in areas that remain relatively free of bamboo.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Pasture clearing from invasive woody plants in the Pantanal: a tool for sustainable management or environmental destruction?
AN  - 928417137
AB  - With a total area of 160,000 km^sup 2^, the Pantanal is one of the largest wetlands in South America and certainly the most famous. It is essential for the maintenance of biodiversity and is highly ranked in national and international protection plans. The ecology of the Pantanal is influenced by the annual inundation, frequent fires during the dry period, and multiple human activities. To maintain traditional low density cattle ranching, which is the economic basis for the Pantanal's human population, the spread of woody vegetation into former pasture areas requires pasture clearing. Legal restrictions, however, have led to the confusion of pasture clearing with the illegal deforestation that has accompanied Brazil's rapid economic development, thus creating serious conflicts between the Pantanal's ranchers and the governmental environmental agency. This dichotomy of interests, i.e., the need to maintain habitat and species diversity while guaranteeing the livelihoods of the ranchers but warding off deforestation, can only be resolved through modern management plans that reconcile the requirements of environmental protection with the economic needs of the ranchers, who are the owners of most of the Pantanal. The key to any such plan's successful implementation is to consider the Pantanal not as a pristine wetland, but as a valuable cultural landscape. Over the last two and a half centuries, the vegetation in large parts of the Pantanal has been altered due to the presence of cattle ranches. This has maintained its habitat diversity and multiple services to humans and to the environment, including the enhancement of species diversity. This management practice corresponds to modern approaches in other parts of the world, where low density animal grazing, sometimes in combination with mechanical removal of woody vegetation are considered powerful management tools for the maintenance of valuable cultural landscapes.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Importance of using many taxa and having adequate controls for monitoring impacts of fire for arthropod conservation
AN  - 927711988
AB  - Fire is a key natural and anthropogenic disturbance factor across many ecosystems, and also an important conservation management tool. However, little is known about arthropod responses to fire, particularly in Mediterranean-type ecosystems, including the biodiverse Cape Floristic Region (CFR). We investigate here the relative variety of responses by different arthropod taxa to fire, and ask whether single-taxon or multi-taxa approaches better suit post-fire biomonitoring for conservation management. Sampling involved multiple techniques and was conducted before fire, 1 year after fire, and 3 years after fire, with unburned areas as controls. Before-and-after statistics were used to identify changes in arthropod populations and assemblages as a result of fire, and between treatment and control sites. However, this was against a background of the annual effects having a major influence on the arthropods, irrespective of fire. Abundance was so variable, even in control plots, that we found it an unreliable indicator of the impact of fire. Overall, arthropods were remarkably resilient to fire, with most taxa recovering in species richness and assemblage composition within 3 years of the fire. Although all taxa showed resilience to fire, there was nevertheless little congruence in temporal recovery of the various taxa. Our results highlight the shortcomings of monitoring fire impacts using only a single-taxon without prior testing for complementarity or sensitivity to fire, while emphasizing the importance of sampling a wide range of taxa to represent overall responses of compositional biodiversity. From this, we recommend, at least for the CFR, that a cross-section of taxa, such as butterflies, ants, and scarab beetles, be used for monitoring arthropods in recovery/fire management conservation programmes. We also recommend that such monitoring be considered against the background of large annual variation seen in unburned areas.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Genetic signature of a severe forest fire on the endangered Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea polatzeki)
AN  - 927008313
AB  - Habitat destruction has been identified as one of the main threats to biodiversity. Among all factors causing habitat disturbance, wildfire is recognized as one of the most important ecological forces that influences not only the physical environment, but also the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. These processes are often translated in population bottlenecks, which occur frequently in threatened species and result in loss of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential. In this study, we analyzed the genetic consequences of a demographic bottleneck produced by a forest fire that reduced the population of the endangered blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea polatzeki), which inhabits the island of Gran Canaria, to approximately 122 individuals. Analysis of nine microsatellite loci revealed that, while a decline in census was observed during the bottleneck, there was no observed excess of heterozygosity or evidence of a decline in allelic richness, two characteristic bottleneck signatures. On the contrary, we observed that the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch has retained significant levels of genetic diversity and shows no evidence of an increased level of inbreeding (F^sub IS^) either before or after the bottleneck. The results from this study have important implications for the conservation of this endangered subspecies and provide insights concerning management strategies to prevent its extinction.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Long-Term Effects of Aeration and Fire on Invasion of Exotic Grasses in Mixed-Brush Plant Communities
AN  - 1014179806
AB  - Invasion of exotic grasses into grasslands dominated by native plants changes fire cycles and reduces biodiversity. Brush management practices that create soil disturbance, such as aeration, may potentially result in invasion of exotic grasses and replacement of native vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that a long-term effect of aeration and prescribed burning is an increase in exotic grasses. The study was conducted at the Chaparral Wildlife Management Area in the western south Texas plains where four treatments were evaluated: aeration, warm-season burn, aeration followed by a warm-season burn, and no treatment (control). The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates. We estimated percentage canopy cover of exotic grasses, native grasses, forbs, litter, bare ground, and woody and succulent plants in 2007. There was a multivariate main effect among treatments for the dependent variables absolute canopy cover of exotic grasses, native grasses, forbs, litter, and bare ground (Wilks's Lambda F^sub 15,179.84^ = 2.78, P = 0.001). Variables that contributed to the significant overall effect included litter (F^sub 3,69^ = 4.32, P = 0.008) and native grasses (F^sub 3,69^ = 6.11, P = 0.001). The multivariate main effect of treatment was significant (Wilks's Lambda F^sub 9,180.25^ = 2.04, P = 0.038) for the relative canopy cover of herbaceous species. Relative cover of exotic grasses was 31% higher (P = 0.024) in control than in the prescribed burn treatment. Native grasses relative cover was 30% higher (P = 0.003) in prescribed burn than in the control treatment. We did not detect differences among treatments in the percentage of total woody and succulent plants canopy cover (P = 0.083). Under the environmental conditions at the time of the study, aeration and/or prescribed burning do not increase exotic grasses. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Adaptive responses and disruptive effects: how major wildfire influences kinship-based social interactions in a forest marsupial
AN  - 915496324
AB  - Abstract

              
Environmental disturbance is predicted to play a key role in the evolution of animal social behaviour. This is because disturbance affects key factors underlying social systems, such as demography, resource availability and genetic structure. However, because natural disturbances are unpredictable there is little information on their effects on social behaviour in wild populations. Here, we investigated how a major wildfire affected cooperation (sharing of hollow trees) by a hollow-dependent marsupial. We based two alternative social predictions on the impacts of fire on population density, genetic structure and resources. We predicted an adaptive social response  from previous work showing that kin selection in den-sharing develops as competition for den resources increases. Thus, kin selection should occur in burnt areas because the fire caused loss of the majority of hollow-bearing trees, but no detectable mortality. Alternatively, fire may have a disruptive social effect , whereby postfire home range-shifts 'neutralize' fine-scale genetic structure, thereby removing opportunities for kin selection between neighbours. Both predictions occurred: the disruptive social effect in burnt habitat and the adaptive social response in adjacent unburnt habitat. The latter followed a massive demographic influx to unburnt 'refuge' habitat that increased competition for dens, leading to a density-related kin selection response. Our results show remarkable short-term plasticity of animal social behaviour and demonstrate how the social effects of disturbance extend into undisturbed habitat owing to landscape-scale demographic shifts. We predicted long-term changes in kinship-based cooperative behaviour resulting from the genetic and resource impacts of forecast changes to fire regimes in these forests. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Successional Responses to Natural Disturbance, Forest Management and Climate Change in British Columbia Forests
AN  - 2124008204
AB  - Natural and human-induced disturbance such as wildfire, insect and disease outbreak, windthrow, and forest harvesting are important drivers for forest renewal, post-disturbance stand structure, and ecosystem function. Each disturbance or combination of disturbances sets up a forest to proceed down a certain successional pathway in terms of structure and function. Using the context of Ecoprovinces and Ecosystem Types, successional pathways of a variety of ecosystems found in British Columbia are briefly described,and the ways in which forest management practices have affected those pathways are discussed. This Extension Note also describes how projected changes in temperature and precipitation may also affect these natural disturbance drivers. The information contained in this article is based on a larger synthesis report that is available in FORREX Series 28 and is designed to facilitate further conversation around building resistant and resilient forests for the future.

T1  - Natural Disturbance and Post-Disturbance Management Effects on Selected Watershed Values
AN  - 2124007915
AB  - This extension note summarizes the key findings of the chapter entitled "A synthesis of the effects of natural disturbance and post-disturbance management on streamflow, stream temperature, suspended sediment, and aquatic invertebrate populations" of FORREX Series 28, which is an overview of the available research on the effects of climate change, natural disturbance (focused on wildfire and insect infestation), and post-disturbance management actions (primarily clearcut salvage harvesting) on key watershed processes and values. The scope of the synthesis was limited to the magnitude and timing of streamflow, stream temperature, suspended sediment, and aquatic invertebrate population dynamics. In general, the effects on hydrologic processes and watershed functions are greater following post-disturbance activities; climate change is anticipated to further negatively compound these natural disturbances. To maintain the resilience of watersheds(that is, the ability of natural systems to recover from perturbation), management activities should be designed to maintain natural hydrologic and ecosystem function wherever possible. Key considerations to maintain resilience include: planning management activities at the site, watershed and landscape scales, maximizing riparian overstory retention within 10 metres of streams, minimizing the introduction of fine sediments into surface water bodies, and monitoring the effects of disturbances and management interventions to support adaptive management. Using the best available information, along with advice from qualified watershed professionals, is key to ensuring effective management.

T1  - Increasing the Resilience of British Columbia’s Rural Communities to Natural Disturbances and Climate Change
AN  - 2124007882
AB  - It is predicted that climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of natural disturbances and weather related natural disasters. Rural forest-based communities are especially vulnerable to changes in natural disturbance regimes influenced by climate change because their economic, social, and cultural aspects of life are closely linked to the local environment and climate.
In this article, we discuss the impacts of wildfires on communities as an example of how natural disturbances impact humans. The impacts to humans of wildfire is indicative of the type of effects that other natural disturbances such as widespread insect infestation, landslides, floods, drought, storms, avalanches, permafrost melt, forest diseases, erosion, and gradual ecosystem change can have on communities. First Nations communities may be significantly and uniquely impacted by natural disturbances and climate change due to their remote location, strong connection, and heavy reliance on the environment for subsistence and in preserving their culture and their unique and often vulnerable economic situation.
We describe the uncertainty of predicting the frequency and intensity of natural disturbances in a particular location. We suggest that the most effective management response to address this uncertainty is to focus on reducing vulnerability and increasing community resilience. Finally, we list some of the management strategies and tools that communities and those that work with them have been using in British Columbia and elsewhere to increase community resilience to natural disturbances and climate change.

T1  - Using stochastic simulation to evaluate competing risks of wildfires and fuels management on an isolated forest carnivore
AN  - 903485884
AB  - Natural resource managers are often challenged with balancing requirements to maintain wildlife populations and to reduce risks of catastrophic or dangerous wildfires. This challenge is exemplified in the Sierra Nevada of California, where proposals to thin vegetation to reduce wildfire risks have been highly controversial, in part because vegetation treatments could adversely affect an imperiled population of the fisher (Martes pennanti) located in the southern Sierra Nevada. The fisher is an uncommon forest carnivore associated with the types of dense, structurally complex forests often targeted for fuel reduction treatments. Vegetation thinning and removal of dead-wood structures would reduce fisher habitat value and remove essential habitat elements used by fishers for resting and denning. However, crown-replacing wildfires also threaten the population's habitat, potentially over much broader areas than the treatments intended to reduce wildfire risks. To investigate the potential relative risks of wildfires and fuels treatments on this isolated fisher population, we coupled three spatial models to simulate the stochastic and interacting effects of wildfires and fuels management on fisher habitat and population size: a spatially dynamic forest succession and disturbance model, a fisher habitat model, and a fisher metapopulation model, which assumed that fisher fecundity and survivorship correlate with habitat quality. We systematically varied fuel treatment rate, treatment intensity, and fire regime, and assessed their relative effects on the modeled fisher population over 60 years. After estimating the number of adult female fishers remaining at the end of each simulation scenario, we compared the immediate negative effects of fuel treatments to the longer-term positive effect of fuel treatment (via reduction of fire hazard) using structural equation modeling. Our simulations suggest that the direct, negative effects of fuel treatments on fisher population size are generally smaller than the indirect, positive effects of fuel treatments, because fuels treatments reduced the probability of large wildfires that can damage and fragment habitat over larger areas. The benefits of fuel treatments varied by elevation and treatment location with the highest net benefits to fisher found at higher elevations and within higher quality fisher habitat. Simulated fire regime also had a large effect with the largest net benefit of fuel treatments occurring when a more severe fire regime was simulated. However, there was large uncertainty in our projections due to stochastic spatial and temporal wildfires dynamic and fisher population dynamics. Our results demonstrate the difficulty of projecting future populations in systems characterized by large, infrequent, stochastic disturbances. Nevertheless, these coupled models offer a useful decision-support system for evaluating the relative effects of alternative management scenarios; and uncertainties can be reduced as additional data accumulate to refine and validate the models.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of prescribed fire, supplemental feeding, and mammalian predator exclusion on hispid cotton rat populations
AN  - 903174966; 21706331
AB  - Predation and food resources can strongly affect small mammal population dynamics directly by altering vital rates or indirectly by influencing behaviors. Fire may also strongly influence population dynamics of species inhabiting fire-adapted habitats because fire can alter food and cover availability. We used capture-mark-recapture and radio-telemetry studies to experimentally examine how supplemental feeding, mammalian predator exclusion, and prescribed fire affected survival, abundance, and reproduction of hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) in southwestern Georgia, USA. Prescribed fire reduced survival, abundance, and rates of transitions to reproductive states. Food supplementation increased survival, transitions to reproductive states, and abundance, but was not sufficient to prevent post-fire declines in any of these parameters. Mammalian predator exclusion did not strongly affect any of the considered parameters. Our results show that fire strongly influenced cotton rat populations in our study site, primarily by reducing cover and increasing predation risk from non-mammalian predators.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Diversity, distribution and conservation status assessment of Paraguayan palms (Arecaceae)
AN  - 898397998
AB  - Indigenous palm species of Paraguay are presented with data on their diversity, distribution, threats and conservation status. The Paraguayan palm flora consists of 23 native species in 11 genera, representing two of the five subfamilies recognized in the group. The palm distribution in the country is strongly related to the different ecoregions present in Paraguay, with number of species by ecoregion being as follow: Cerrado (18), Upper Parana Atlantic forest (6), Wet Chaco (4), Pantanal (2), and Dry Chaco (1). Half of the species display an acaulescent habit reflecting an interesting ecological adaptation to natural fires in the Cerrado. The alarming rate of habitat modification that the country is undergoing since 1940s has put palms under a high risk of extinction in the wild. A GIS model was used to calculate the extent of occurrence and the area of occupancy of the species in order to assess their conservation status applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. This analysis shows that about 30% of the species are threatened; one species is Critically Endangered, three of them are Endangered, and three are Vulnerable. One species (Acrocomia hassleri) is considered Near Threatened, 13 are Least Concern whereas two species are insufficiently known and therefore unable to be assessed. Important areas for palm conservation in Paraguay were identified, revealing the importance of the Amambay department. Conservation measures for the threatened species identified are proposed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Evidence and implications of recent and projected climate change in Alaska's forest ecosystems
AN  - 2300624426
AB  - The structure and function of Alaska's forests have changed significantly in response to a changing climate, including alterations in species composition and climate feedbacks (e.g., carbon, radiation budgets) that have important regional societal consequences and human feedbacks to forest ecosystems. In this paper we present the first comprehensive synthesis of climate‐change impacts on all forested ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate. We then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system and associated socio‐economic impacts, as presented in the current literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the Interior‐boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer‐ to deciduous‐dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected increases in temperature in the Southcentral‐ and Kenai‐boreal forests will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by invasive plant species. In the Coastal‐temperate forest region snow and ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and marine ecosystem productivity. These climate‐related changes will affect plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional societal consequences, and trace‐gas emissions and radiation budgets, which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate, emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research. The framework also serves as a visual tool for resource managers and policy makers to develop regional and global management strategies and to inform policies related to climate mitigation and adaptation.

T1  - Regional carbon dioxide implications of forest bioenergy production
AN  - 1017689110
AB  - Strategies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions include substitution of fossil fuel with bioenergy from forests, where carbon emitted is expected to be recaptured in the growth of new biomass to achieve zero net emissions, and forest thinning to reduce wildfire emissions. Here, we use forest inventory data to show that fire prevention measures and large-scale bioenergy harvest in US West Coast forests lead to 2-14% (46-405 Tg C) higher emissions compared with current management practices over the next 20 years. We studied 80 forest types in 19 ecoregions, and found that the current carbon sink in 16 of these ecoregions is sufficiently strong that it cannot be matched or exceeded through substitution of fossil fuels by forest bioenergy. If the sink in these ecoregions weakens below its current level by 30-60 g C m
-2  yr-1  owing to insect infestations, increased fire emissions or reduced primary production, management schemes including bioenergy production may succeed in jointly reducing fire risk and carbon emissions. In the remaining three ecoregions, immediate implementation of fire prevention and biofuel policies may yield net emission savings. Hence, forest policy should consider current forest carbon balance, local forest conditions and ecosystem sustainability in establishing how to decrease emissions.

T1  - Effects of predation, fire, and supplemental feeding on populations of two species of Peromyscus mice
AN  - 900730603
AB  - Food resources and predation play important roles in determining small mammal population dynamics. These factors also can interact as individuals under predation pressure make trade-offs between access to food resources and exposure to predators. Fires consume food sources and reduce cover, which increases exposure to predators. For species that occur in areas with frequent fire, it is instructive to consider how all of these factors interact to affect populations of interest. We examined how supplemental feeding, mammalian predator exclusion, and prescribed fire affected survival, abundance, and reproduction of cotton mice (Peromyscus gossypinus) and oldfield mice (P. polionotus) in a longleaf pine ecosystem. Burning and predator exclusion interacted to affect survival of cotton mice; survival was similar in predator exclosures and controls in nonburning periods and in controls following prescribed burns but increased in exclosures following burns. Rates of transitions to reproductive states (which for females includes lactation or gravidity and for males, descent of testes) decreased in burn years but increased with the combination of feeding and predator exclusion. Supplemental feeding increased abundances. Among oldfield mice, survival and abundance were greater in predator exclusion areas than in controls. Supplemental feeding and the interaction of feeding and predator exclusion also increased abundances. During peak breeding seasons during which burning occurred rates of transitions to reproductive states declined to such an extent that reproductive transition rates in these seasons were lower than during nonpeak breeding seasons.

T1  - Managing Forests because Carbon Matters: Integrating Energy, Products, and Land Management Policy
AN  - 900437243
AB  - The United States needs many different types of forests: some managed for wood products plus other benefits, and some managed for nonconsumptive uses and benefits. The objective of reducing global greenhouse gases (GHG) requires increasing carbon storage in pools other than the atmosphere. Growing more forests and keeping forests as forests are only part of the solution, because focusing solely on the sequestration benefits of the forests misses the important (and substantial) carbon storage and substitution GHG benefits of harvested forest products, as well as other benefits of active forest management. Forests and global climate are closely linked in terms of carbon storage and releases, water fluxes from the soil and into the atmosphere, and solar energy capture. Understanding how carbon dynamics are affected by stand age, density, and management and will evolve with climate change is fundamental to exploiting the capacity for sustainably managed forests to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, even though temperate forests continue to be carbon sinks, in western North America forest fires and tree mortality from insects are converting some forests into net carbon sources. Expanding forest biomass use for biofuels and energy generation will compete with traditional forest products, but it may also produce benefits through competition and market efficiency. Short-rotation woody crops, as well as landowners' preferences-based on investment-return expectations and environmental considerations, both of which will be affected by energy and environmental policies-have the potential to increase biomass supply. Unlike metals, concrete, and plastic, forest products store atmospheric carbon and have low embodied energy (the amount of energy it takes to make products), so there is a substitution effect when wood is used in place of other building materials. Wood used for energy production also provides substitution benefits by reducing the flow of fossil fuel-based carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The value of carbon credits generafed by forest carbon offset projects differs dramatically, depending on the sets of carbon pools allowed by the protocol and baseline employed. The costs associated with establishing and maintaining offset projects depend largely on the protocols' specifics. Measurement challenges and relatively high transaction costs needed for forest carbon offsets warrant consideration of other policies that promote climate benefits from forests and forest products but do not require project-specific accounting. Policies can foster changes in forest management and product manufacture that reduce carbon emissions over time while maintaining forests for environmental and societal benefits. US policymckers should take to heart the finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report when it concluded that "In the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre, or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit." A rational energy and environmental policy framework must be based on the premise that atmospheric greenhouse gas levels are increasing primarily because of the addition of geologic fossil fuel-based carbon into the carbon cycle. Forest carbon policy that builds on the scientific information summarized in this article can be a significant and important part of a comprehensive energy policy that provides for energy independence and carbon benefits while simultaneously providing clean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, and other uses and values.

T1  - Ungulate preference for burned patches reveals strength of fire–grazing interaction
AN  - 2299166514
AB  - The interactions between fire and grazing are widespread throughout fire‐dependent landscapes. The utilization of burned areas by grazing animals establishes the fire–grazing interaction, but the preference for recently burned areas relative to other influences (water, topography, etc.) is unknown. In this study, we determine the strength of the fire–grazing interaction by quantifying the influence of fire on ungulate site selection. We compare the preference for recently burned patches relative to the influence of other environmental factors that contribute to site selection; compare that preference between native and introduced ungulates; test relationships between area burned and herbivore preference; and determine forage quality and quantity as mechanisms of site selection. We used two large ungulate species at two grassland locations within the southern Great Plains, USA. At each location, spatially distinct patches were burned within larger areas through time, allowing animals to select among burned and unburned areas. Using fine scale ungulate location data, we estimated resource selection functions to examine environmental factors in site selection. Ungulates preferred recently burned areas and avoided areas with greater time since fire, regardless of the size of landscape, herbivore species, or proportion of area burned. Forage quality was inversely related to time since fire, while forage quantity was positively related. We show that fire is an important component of large ungulate behavior with a strong influence on site selection that drives the fire–grazing interaction. This interaction is an ecosystem process that supersedes fire and grazing as separate factors, shaping grassland landscapes. Inclusion of the fire–grazing interaction into ecological studies and conservation practices of fire‐prone systems will aid in better understanding and managing these systems.

T1  - Unraveling the drivers of intensifying forest disturbance regimes in Europe
AN  - 896448796
AB  - Abstract

              
Natural disturbances like wildfire, windthrow and insect outbreaks are critical drivers of composition, structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. They are strongly climate-sensitive, and are thus likely to be distinctly affected by climatic changes. Observations across Europe show that in recent decades, forest disturbance regimes have intensified markedly, resulting in a strong increase in damage from wind, bark beetles and wildfires. Climate change is frequently hypothesized as the main driving force behind this intensification, but changes in forest structure and composition associated with management activities such as promoting conifers and increasing standing timber volume (i.e. 'forest change') also strongly influence susceptibility to disturbances. Here, we show that from 1958 to 2001, forest change contributed in the same order of magnitude as climate change to the increase in disturbance damage in Europe's forests. Climate change was the main driver of the increase in area burnt, while changes in forest extent, structure and composition particularly affected the variation in wind and bark beetle damage. For all three disturbance agents, damage was most severe when conducive weather conditions and increased forest susceptibility coincided. We conclude that a continuing trend towards more disturbance-prone conditions is likely for large parts of Europe's forests, and can have strong detrimental effects on forest carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Understanding the interacting drivers of natural disturbance regimes is thus a prerequisite for climate change mitigation and adaptation in forest ecosystem management.

T1  - Economic and Social Impacts of Wildfires and Invasive Plants in American Deserts: Lessons From the Great Basin
AN  - 894513327
AB  - Research on the impacts of wildfire and invasive plants in rangelands has focused on biophysical rather than human dimensions of these environmental processes. We offer a synthetic perspective on economic and social aspects of wildfire and invasive plants in American deserts, focusing on the Great Basin because greater research attention has been given to the effects of cheatgrass expansion than to other desert wildfire/invasion cycles. We focus first on impacts at the level of the individual decision-maker, then on impacts experienced at the human community or larger socio-political scales. Economic impacts of wildfire differ from those of invasive grasses because although fire typically reduces forage availability and thus ranch profit opportunities, invasive grasses can also be used as a forage source and ranchers have adapted their grazing systems to take advantage of that circumstance. To reduce the threat of increased ranch bankruptcies, strategies are needed that can increase access to alternative early-season forage sources and/or promote diversification of ranch income streams by capturing value from ranch ecosystem services other than forage. The growth of low-density, exurban subdivisions in Western deserts influences not only the pattern and frequency of wildfire and plant invasions but also affects prevailing public opinion toward potential management options, and thereby the capacity of land management agencies to use those options. Outreach efforts can influence public opinion, but must be rooted in new knowledge about multiple impacts of invasion and increased wildfire in American deserts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Conservation value of low fire frequency in tropical savannas: Ants in monsoonal northern Australia
AN  - 878833352
AB  - Abstract              The conservation values of 'old-growth' forests in landscapes subject to repeated disturbance by fire or logging have received considerable conservation attention. However, little is known of the conservation values of old-growth sites in ecosystems with an evolutionary history of highly frequent disturbance. Here we address the value of low fire frequency (<1 fire/10 years) in tropical savannas, the world's most fire-prone biome, in terms of ant biodiversity. We do this by comparing savanna ant communities within the Territory Wildlife Park (TWP) near Darwin in the Australian monsoonal tropics, which has experienced a low incidence of fire over 25 years due to active fire exclusion, with those of adjacent (outside) sites experiencing the ambient fire regime of burning every 2-5 years. Ants were sampled using terrestrial and arboreal pitfall traps at 16 sites, eight each inside and outside TWP. More than 16000 ants were recorded during the study, representing a total of 98 ant species from 30 genera. More species in total were recorded outside (90) than inside (74) TWP, but there was no difference in mean site species richness or abundance, and overall species composition was similar. All species recorded inside TWP are common and widespread throughout the savanna landscapes of the broader region, in the absence of active fire exclusion. Low fire frequency at the Territory Wildlife Park therefore does not appear to have enhanced regional ant conservation values. Our findings reinforce the importance of targeting fire regimes that are clearly linked to positive conservation outcomes, rather than assuming a need for maximum 'pyrodiversity'.

T1  - Amphibian Responses to Wildfire in the Western United States: Emerging Patterns from Short-Term Studies
AN  - 2409022751
AB  - The increased frequency and severity of large wildfires in the western United States is an important ecological and management issue with direct relevance to amphibian conservation. Although the knowledge of fire effects on amphibians in the region is still limited relative to most other vertebrate species, we reviewed the current literature to determine if there are evident patterns that might be informative for conservation or management strategies. Of the seven studies that compared pre- and post-wildfire data on a variety of metrics, ranging from amphibian occupancy to body condition, two reported positive responses and five detected negative responses by at least one species. Another seven studies used a retrospective approach to compare effects of wildfire on populations: two studies reported positive effects, three reported negative effects from wildfire, and two reported no effects. All four studies that included plethodontid salamanders reported negative effects on populations or individuals; these effects were greater in forests where fire had been suppressed and in areas that burned with high severity. Species that breed in streams are also vulnerable to post-wildfire changes in habitat, especially in the Southwest. Wildfire is also important for maintaining suitable habitat for diverse amphibian communities, although those results may not be evident immediately after an area burns. We expect that wildfire will extirpate few healthy amphibian populations, but it is still unclear how populations will respond to wildfire in the context of land management (including pre- and post-fire timber harvest) and fragmentation. Wildfire may also increase the risk of decline or extirpation for small, isolated, or stressed (e.g., from drought or disease) populations. Improved understanding of how these effects vary according to changes in fire frequency and severity are critical to form more effective conservation strategies for amphibians in the western United States.

T1  - The Effects of Wildfire on Mortality and Resources for an Arboreal Marsupial: Resilience to Fire Events but Susceptibility to Fire Regime Change
AN  - 1306966345
AB  - Background 
Big environmental disturbances have big ecological effects, yet these are not always what we might expect. Understanding the proximate effects of major disturbances, such as severe wildfires, on individuals, populations and habitats will be essential for understanding how predicted future increases in the frequency of such disturbances will affect ecosystems. However, researchers rarely have access to data from immediately before and after such events. Here we report on the effects of a severe and extensive forest wildfire on mortality, reproductive output and availability of key shelter resources for an arboreal marsupial. We also investigated the behavioural response of individuals to changed shelter resource availability in the post-fire environment.
 Methodology/Principal Findings 
We fitted proximity-logging radiotransmitters to mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami) before, during and after the 2009 wildfires in Victoria, Australia. Surprisingly, we detected no mortality associated with the fire, and despite a significant post-fire decrease in the proportion of females carrying pouch young in the burnt area, there was no short-term post-fire population decline. The major consequence of this fire for mountain brushtail possums was the loss of over 80% of hollow-bearing trees. The types of trees preferred as shelter sites (highly decayed dead standing trees) were those most likely to collapse after fire. Individuals adapted to resource decline by being more flexible in resource selection after the fire, but not by increased resource sharing.
 Conclusions/Significance 
Despite short-term demographic resilience and behavioural adaptation following this fire, the major loss of decayed hollow trees suggests the increased frequency of stand-replacing wildfires predicted under climate change will pose major challenges for shelter resource availability for hollow-dependent fauna. Hollow-bearing trees are typically biological legacies of previous forest generations in post-fire regrowth forests but will cease to be recruited to future regrowth forests if the interval between severe fires becomes too rapid for hollow formation.

T1  - Landscape context matters: local habitat and landscape effects on the abundance and patch occupancy of collared lizards in managed grasslands
AN  - 871324583
AB  - The distribution and abundance of a species may be simultaneously influenced by both local-scale habitat features and the broader patch and landscape contexts in which these populations occur. Different factors may influence patch occupancy (presence-absence) versus local abundance (number of individuals within patches), and at different scales, and thus ideally both occupancy and abundance should be investigated, especially in studies that seek to understand the consequences of land management on species persistence. Our study evaluated the relative influences of variables associated with the local habitat patch, hillside (patch context), and landscape context on patch occupancy and abundance of the collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris) within tallgrass prairie managed under different fire and grazing regimes in the northern Flint Hills of Kansas, USA. Using a multi-model information-theoretic approach that accounted for detection bias, we found that collared lizard abundance and occupancy was influenced by factors measured at both the local habitat and landscape scales. At a local scale, collared lizard abundance was greatest on large rock ledges that had lots of crevices, high vegetation complexity, and were located higher up on the hillslope. At the landscape scale, collared lizard abundance and occupancy were both higher in watersheds that were burned frequently (1-2 year intervals). Interestingly, grazing only had a significant effect on occupancy and abundance within less frequently burned (4-year burn interval) watersheds. Our results suggest that, in addition to the obvious habitat needs of this species (availability of suitable rock habitat), land-management practices have the potential to influence collared lizard presence and abundance in the grasslands of the Flint Hills. Thus, mapping the availability of suitable habitat is unlikely to be sufficient for evaluating species distributions and persistence in such cases without consideration of landscape management and disturbance history.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - High Density Nesting of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in a Post-fire Great Lakes Jack Pine Forest: a Journal of Ornithology
AN  - 872246930
AB  - A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March-July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations.

T1  - Can a seed bank provide demographic and genetic rescue in a declining population of the endangered shrub Acacia pinguifolia?
AN  - 865075324
AB  - Many threatened species suffer reduced genetic diversity as a result of small population size and isolation. However, species with a persistent seed bank may be buffered against genetic loss as seed banks are expected to accumulate the reproductive output of many seasons. For fire-dependent species in decline, prescribed ecological burning may be a means to stimulate germination and recover genetic diversity stored in the seed bank, providing a demographic and genetic rescue effect. Here we investigated the effectiveness of this strategy in a small, isolated and inbred population of the endangered shrub, Acacia pinguifolia. We surveyed genetic diversity and structure of remnant populations of A. pinguifolia and monitored regeneration before and after burning. Germination was stimulated by fire, but seedling numbers 18 months post-fire were low and barely above the number of adults killed by the fire. Genetic diversity was marginally higher in the post-fire seedling cohort than the pre-fire adults (H^sub E^ = 0.1 vs. 0.09, respectively). Outcrossing rates of open-pollinated seed from surrounding plants suggested moderately high levels of self-fertilisation (t ^sub m^ = 0.65) and analysis of fine-scale genetic structure implied pollen and seed dispersal over distances of several metres, suggesting that restricted gene flow and inbreeding may act to limit genetic diversity in the seed bank. We conclude that prescribed burning has not been immediately successful as a recovery strategy for this relictual population of A. pinguifolia, though future monitoring may detect additional recruits. Alternative conservation strategies, including performing inter-population crosses, may be required to restore genetic diversity and ameliorate extinction risks.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 883074648
AB  - California wildfires are expected and they are followed by landslides and floods. A changing culture in traditional responders has co-evolved with a culture of pet owner disaster preparedness in California. This is demonstrated by the documentation of the in California wildfires from 2003-2009. The 2003 wildfires in San Diego County involved a massive relocation of people, small companion animals and over 700 horses. It was a milestone event in allowing co-located human and animal shelters. The intent was for animals to be maintained in adjacent shelters, but the result was humans taking up residence with their animal companions. Pet owners sought to keep their family, including their pets, together. It appeared that pets were providing comfort to their owners. In the same region during 2007, pet owners mobilized rapidly. They were clearly more prepared than they were in 2003. During 2008, a record 1400 fires were burning in California on July 1st. The Santa Barbara Gap Fire mobilized an expert Santa Barbara Equine evacuation team. The human Red Cross evacuation center allowed small animal cohabitation. At the same time, the Butte Lightning Complex fires (37 fires) involved a unique cohort of canine evacuees for an extended duration and requiring unprecedented veterinary volunteers. In 2009, the Santa Barbara Jesusita fire threatened an urban area and evacuation of 35,000 people. It included a vulnerable human population with health disabilities that required ambulance evacuation assistance. Small companion animals were allowed to evacuate in the front cab of the ambulance. Ambulance drivers remarked that they dreaded forcing patients to leave behind their pets and it was a relief to bring the pets along. In summary, the response to repeated California wildfires from 2003 to 2009 has demonstrated an evolving culture of animal disaster preparedness for both traditional responders and companion animal owners.

T1  - Influence of fire history on small mammal distributions: insights from a 100-year post-fire chronosequence
AN  - 860583945
AB  - Abstract

              
Aim Fire affects the structure and dynamics of ecosystems world-wide, over long time periods (decades and centuries) and at large spatial scales (landscapes and regions). A pressing challenge for ecologists is to develop models that explain and predict faunal responses to fire at broad temporal and spatial scales. We used a 105-year post-fire chronosequence to investigate small mammal responses to fire across an extensive area of 'tree mallee' (i.e. vegetation characterized by small multi-stemmed eucalypts).

              
Location The Murray Mallee region (104,000km²) of semi-arid Australia.

              
Methods First, we surveyed small mammals at 260 sites and explored the fire responses of four species using nonlinear regression models. Second, we assessed the predictive accuracy of models using cross-validation and by testing with independent data. Third, we examined our results in relation to an influential model of animal succession, the habitat accommodation model.

              
Results Two of four study species showed a clear response to fire history. The distribution of the Mallee Ningaui Ningaui yvonneae, a carnivorous marsupial, was strongly associated with mature vegetation characterized by its cover of hummock grass. The occurrence of breeding females was predicted to increase up to 40-105years post-fire, highlighting the extensive time periods over which small mammal populations may be affected by fire. Evaluation of models for N. yvonneae demonstrated that accurate predictions of species occurrence can be made from fire history and vegetation data, across large geographical areas. The introduced House Mouse Mus domesticus was the only species positively associated with recently burnt vegetation.

              
Main conclusions Understanding the impact of fire over long time periods will benefit ecological and conservation management. In this example, tracts of long-unburnt mallee vegetation were identified as important habitat for a fire-sensitive native mammal. Small mammal responses to fire can be predicted accurately at broad spatial scales; however, a conceptual model of post-fire change in community structure developed in temperate Australia is not, on its own, sufficient for small mammals in semi-arid systems.

T1  - Fire refugia: The mechanism governing animal survivorship within a highly flammable plant
AN  - 858792781
AB  - Abstract

              
Identifying factors that influence the survival of individuals during disturbance is critical to understanding patterns of species reassembly within ecological communities. Although most studies of recovery of populations post-burning acknowledge the potentially important contribution of animals surviving in situ, few have measured the effectiveness of refugia. This paper tests the hypothesis that some plants with tightly packed leaf-bases provide a refuge for invertebrates during fire (even when the plants themselves burn) by using the highly flammable grass tree (Xanthorrhoeaceae: Xanthorrhoea). Invertebrates were sampled from four unburnt and five experimentally burnt grass trees (Xanthorrhoea preissii Endl.). Also collected were invertebrates fleeing during burning. The dataset comprises 949 specimens, representing 81 species from 18 orders, of which 749 individuals were from unburned plants. Slaters (Isopoda), silverfish (Thysanura), spiders (Araneae) and bugs (Hemiptera) dominated assemblages of the unburnt grass trees. Despite grass trees burning at temperatures of up to 515°C, some invertebrates survived in situ. Species-specific microhabitat preferences within the plant appeared to influence survivorship. Species collected in the crown of unburned plants were found more often alive on burnt plants than species typically inhabiting the dead skirt of decaying leaves (thatch). We contend that the mechanism causing differential mortality is fire temperature. In the dead skirt, temperatures reached 225.33±66.57°C. In contrast, a region of mild temperature (25.00±3.54°C) persisted throughout burning near the apical meristem (within the crown). We conclude that grass trees are a potential reservoir from which invertebrates might re-colonize recently burnt areas. However, owing to species-specific microhabitat preferences and differential mortality across microhabitats, the invertebrate assemblage remaining in situ will be restricted taxonomically compared with the original grass tree fauna. Moreover, different fire regimes might mediate the effectiveness of grass trees as refugia. Finally, we argue that in situ survival of invertebrates within plants with tightly packed leaf-bases is an unrecognized global phenomenon applicable to a wide array of plant taxa.

T1  - Personal Perspectives on Commercial versus Communal African Fire Paradigms when Using Fire to Manage Rangelands for Domestic Livestock and Wildlife in Southern and East African Ecosystems
AN  - 2409020925
AB  - Africa is often referred to as the Fire Continent, and fire is recognised as a natural factor of the environment due to the prevalence of lightning storms and an ideal fire climate in the less arid regions with seasonal drought. On a global scale, the most extensive areas of tropical savanna, characterized by grassy under stories that become extremely flammable during the dry season, occur in Africa. The use of fire in Africa to manage vegetation for domestic livestock and indigenous wildlife is widely recognized by both commercial and communal land users. Research on the effects of fire has been conducted throughout the grassland and savanna areas since the early twentieth century, resulting in the development of effective and practical guidelines for prescribed burning for domestic livestock and wildlife management systems. Generally, the reasons for prescribed burning in Africa are similar for both commercial and communal land users, namely, to remove moribund and or unacceptable plant material and to control the encroachment of undesirable plants negatively affecting domestic livestock and wildlife. In addition, commercial operators use fire to manage wildlife conservation areas. Prescribed burning to control ticks is also widely used in communal communities but is generally not recognised in commercial livestock enterprises. However, research has shown that tick populations can be reduced using fire to alter the micro-habitat for these organisms. Until recently, commercial and communal land users held differing views on the appropriate season for prescribed burning, with the former igniting fires shortly after the first spring rains and the latter burning throughout the dry winter period. Subsequent research has shown that both seasons of burn have similar effects; the key requirement being that the grass sward is dormant at the time of burning to minimise the negative effects on the vegetation. A valuable tentative comparison has been made between fire management practices applied by commercial land users and communal land users, and provides an exciting opportunity for further and essential research to be conducted to gain greater insight into how communal African communities use fire. Based on extensive experience, my aim is to provide a personal perspective on the use of fire by commercial and communal land users for managing rangelands in southern and east African regions of the continent.

T1  - Land-use history, historical connectivity, and land management interact to determine longleaf pine woodland understory richness and composition
AN  - 1517177488
AB  - Restoration and management activities targeted at recovering biodiversity can lead to unexpected results. In part, this is due to a lack of understanding of how site-level characteristics, landscape factors, and land-use history interact with restoration and management practices to determine patterns of diversity. For plants, such factors may be particularly important since plant populations often exhibit lagged responses to habitat loss and degradation. Here, we assess the importance of site-level, landscape, and historical effects for understory plant species richness and composition across a set of 40 longleaf pine Pinus palustris woodlands undergoing restoration for the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker in the southeastern United States. Land-use history had an overarching effect on richness and composition. Relative to historically forested sites, sites with agricultural histories (i.e. former pastures or cultivated fields) supported lower species richness and an altered species composition due to fewer upland longleaf pine woodland community members. Landscape effects did not influence the total number of species in either historically forested or post-agricultural sites; however, understory species composition was affected by historical connectivity, but only for post-agricultural sites. The influences of management and restoration activities were only apparent once land-use history was accounted for. Prescribed burning and mechanical overstory thinning were key drivers of understory composition and promoted understory richness in post-agricultural sites. In historically forested sites these activities had no impact on richness and only prescribed fire influenced composition. Our findings reveal complex interplays between site-level, landscape, and historical effects, suggest fundamentally different controls over plant communities in longleaf pine woodlands with varying land-use history, and underscore the importance of considering land-use history and landscape effects during restoration.

T1  - Agricultural Coconut Forest as Habitat for the Critically Endangered Tuamotu Kingfisher (Todiramphus Gambieri Gertrudae)
AN  - 1000443689
AB  - Abstract.--              The effects of anthropogenic habitat modification are evident on tropical Pacific islands where forests have been extensively converted to plantations of Coconut Palm (Cocos nucifera ). We evaluated resource selection in the critically endangered Tuamotu Kingfisher (Todiramphus gambieri gertrudae ), which is confined to a single population on the low-elevation island of Niau Atoll in French Polynesia. Our analyses indicate that resources associated with foraging underlie space use and habitat selection of Tuamotu Kingfishers at multiple spatial scales. At the island scale, the occurrence of the species was best predicted by habitat features associated with foraging opportunities, including agricultural coconut forest with open understory, hunting perches, and exposed ground. Conversely, the species' distribution was negatively associated with undisturbed vegetation, including primary feo forest and fallow coconut plantation. At the home-range scale, utilization distributions of radiomarked Tuamotu Kingfishers also indicated that birds selected agricultural coconut forest and least preferred native feo forest. Observations further indicated that foraging birds selected coconut plantations managed with prescribed burning for hunting. The Tuamotu Kingfisher is a rare example of a threatened tropical species that likely benefits from agricultural management, and our findings provide support for conservation strategies based on establishing rescue populations on other islands with coconut plantations. We suggest that incorporating agricultural coconut forests into conservation planning could help prevent the extinction of several kingfisher species that historically relied on the natural broadleaf habitats that are now almost entirely absent from insular Pacific Oceania.

T1  - Seed arrival and ecological filters interact to assemble high-diversity plant communities
AN  - 868073673
AB  - Two prominent mechanisms proposed to structure biodiversity are niche-based ecological filtering and chance arrival of propagules from the species pool. Seed arrival is hypothesized to play a particularly strong role in high-diversity plant communities with large potential species pools and many rare species, but few studies have explored how seed arrival and local ecological filters interactively assemble species-rich communities in space and time. We experimentally manipulated seed arrival and multiple ecological filters in high-diversity, herbaceous-dominated groundcover communities in longleaf pine savannas, which contain the highest small-scale species richness in North America (up to >40 species/m^sup 2^). We tested three hypotheses: (1) local communities constitute relatively open-membership assemblages, in which increased seed arrival from the species pool strongly increases species richness; (2) ecological filters imposed by local fire intensity and soil moisture influence recruitment and richness of immigrating species; and (3) ecological filters increase similarity in the composition of immigrating species. In a two-year factorial field experiment, we manipulated local fire intensity by increasing pre-fire fuel loads, soil moisture using rain shelters and irrigation, and seed arrival by adding seeds from the local species pool. Seed arrival increased species richness regardless of fire intensity and soil moisture but interacted with both ecological filters to influence community assembly. High-intensity fire decreased richness of resident species, suggesting an important abiotic filter. In contrast, high-intensity fire increased recruitment and richness of immigrating species, presumably by decreasing effects of other ecological filters (competition and resource limitation) in postfire environments. Drought decreased recruitment and richness of immigrating species, whereas wet soil conditions increased recruitment but decreased or had little effect on richness. Moreover, some ecological filters (wet soil conditions and, to a lesser extent, high-intensity fire) increased similarity in the composition of immigrating species, illustrating conditions that influence deterministic community assembly in species-rich communities. Our experiment provides insights into how dispersal-assembly mechanisms may interact with niche-assembly mechanisms in space (spatial variation in disturbance) and time (temporal variation in resource availability) to structure high-diversity communities and can help guide conservation of threatened longleaf pine ecosystems in the face of habitat fragmentation and environmental change.

T1  - Another tool in the toolbox? Using fire and grazing to promote bird diversity in highly fragmented landscapes
AN  - 2299129671
AB  - The grasslands of central North America have experienced drastic reductions in extent, removal of historic disturbance patterns, and homogenization of remaining fragments. This has resulted in steep declines for a broad swath of grassland biodiversity. Recent work in relatively extensive grasslands has demonstrated that mimicking historic disturbance patterns using a fire‐grazing interaction can increase the abundance and diversity of grassland birds through increased habitat heterogeneity. We examined the efficacy of this management strategy for promoting avian diversity in highly fragmented landscapes, which represent the bulk of remaining grassland bird habitats in the tallgrass prairie region. We quantified the population density of obligate and facultative grassland bird species along transects in 13 experimental research pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri (USA), divided among three treatments: 1) spatially discrete fires and free access by cattle (“patch‐burn grazed”), 2) free access by cattle and a single complete burn (“grazed‐and‐burned”), and 3) a single complete burn with no cattle (“burned‐only”). We expected that patch‐burn grazing would produce a bird community that overlapped that of the grazed‐and‐burned and burned‐only treatments, because it would provide habitat for species associated with both. However, an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that community structure on pastures managed using patch‐burn grazing instead diverged significantly from both of the other treatments. Differences in community structure were most highly correlated with visual obstruction and wooded edge density in the landscape, suggesting bird communities are differentiated not only by their structural habitat requirements, but also by the varying degrees of sensitivity to landscape fragmentation of their component species. The future success of this management scheme for fragmented grasslands hinges on if, after an optimal stocking rate is identified, adequate habitat can be maintained for a diverse bird community, or whether fragmentation will perpetually limit the efficacy of this method in these landscapes.

T1  - Ghosts of Yellowstone: Multi-Decadal Histories of Wildlife Populations Captured by Bones on a Modern Landscape
AN  - 1292884973
AB  - Natural accumulations of skeletal material (death assemblages) have the potential to provide historical data on species diversity and population structure for regions lacking decades of wildlife monitoring, thereby contributing valuable baseline data for conservation and management strategies. Previous studies of the ecological and temporal resolutions of death assemblages from terrestrial large-mammal communities, however, have largely focused on broad patterns of community composition in tropical settings. Here, I expand the environmental sampling of large-mammal death assemblages into a temperate biome and explore more demanding assessments of ecological fidelity by testing their capacity to record past population fluctuations of individual species in the well-studied ungulate community of Yellowstone National Park (Yellowstone). Despite dramatic ecological changes following the 1988 wildfires and 1995 wolf re-introduction, the Yellowstone death assemblage is highly faithful to the living community in species richness and community structure. These results agree with studies of tropical death assemblages and establish the broad capability of vertebrate remains to provide high-quality ecological data from disparate ecosystems and biomes. Importantly, the Yellowstone death assemblage also correctly identifies species that changed significantly in abundance over the last 20 to ∼80 years and the directions of those shifts (including local invasions and extinctions). The relative frequency of fresh versus weathered bones for individual species is also consistent with documented trends in living population sizes. Radiocarbon dating verifies the historical source of bones from Equus caballus (horse): a functionally extinct species. Bone surveys are a broadly valuable tool for obtaining population trends and baseline shifts over decadal-to-centennial timescales.

T1  - Effects of Postfire Salvage Logging on Deadwood-Associated Beetles; Efectos del Rescate de Madera Después de Incendios sobre Escarabajos Asociados a Madera Muerta
AN  - 848568763
AB  - Abstract:  In Canada and the United States pressure to recoup financial costs of wildfire by harvesting burned timber is increasing, despite insufficient understanding of the ecological consequences of postfire salvage logging. We compared the species richness and composition of deadwood-associated beetle assemblages among undisturbed, recently burned, logged, and salvage-logged, boreal, mixed-wood stands. Species richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species. In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either disturbance alone. Thus, increases in salvage logging of burned forests may have serious negative consequences for deadwood-associated beetles and their ecological functions in early postfire successional forests.

T1  - Differences in bird communities in postfire silvicultural practices stands within pine forest of South Korea
AN  - 848543250
AB  - We examined differences in bird communities in relation to characteristics of habitat structure in a pine forest, Samcheok, South Korea. An unburned stand, a stand burned 7 years earlier and then naturally restored, and a stand where Japanese red pine Pinus densiflora seedlings were planted after the fire were used for the survey. Habitat structure was dramatically changed by postfire silvicultural practices. Number of stand trees, shrubs, seedlings, snags, and vegetation coverage were significantly different among study stands. We made 1,421 detections of 46 bird species during 23 separate line transect surveys per stand between February 2007 and December 2008. The mean number of observed bird species and individuals, bird species diversity index (H'), and Simpson's diversity index (D ^sub s^) were highest in the unburned stand and lowest in the pine seedling stand. There were more species and individuals of forest-dwelling birds in the unburned stand than both burned stands. Canopy and cavity nesters, foliage searchers, bark gleaners, and timber drillers were significantly higher in the unburned stand. In the pine seedling stand, densities of birds that prefer open field and shrub cover were higher. Stand structure was simplified in the pine seedling stand by postfire practices. Because of differences in habitat structure and bird communities, postfire practices in the burned stand should be re-evaluated. Also, management strategies for pine forest after forest fires are needed based on results of long-term experiments. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Starting points for small mammal population recovery after wildfire: recolonisation or residual populations?
AN  - 817784279
AB  - Wildfire is a major driver of spatio-temporal variation in terrestrial ecosystems. Large wildfires are predicted to occur more frequently due to climate change. The mechanisms by which post-fire recovery proceeds are influenced by the abundance of survivors, and their distribution in relation to habitat variability and refugia. Thus, characterising early post-fire demographic processes is critical to understanding the demographic and community-level responses of ecosystems to fire. The Black Saturday fires of February 2009 burnt an area of approximately 3500 km2 in Victoria, Australia. We quantified the effects of this high severity forest fire on the habitat, abundance, sex ratio and body mass of two small mammal species, the agile antechinus Antechinus agilis and bush rat Rattus fuscipes. We developed a hypothetical framework to distinguish in situ survival and rapid recolonisation as the processes underlying short-term post-fire distributions. These hypotheses were based on expected patterns of abundance over increasing distances from unburnt sources, and the estimated recolonisation capabilities of each species and sex. The agile antechinus and bush rat were present in burnt sites at 30% and 12% of the density observed in unburnt sites. In situ survival, and not recolonisation, was the most plausible explanation for our findings. Abundance and body mass data indicated a greater effect of fire on the bush rat than the agile antechinus. The bush rat showed a shift in topographic association, whereby drainage lines acted as post-fire refugia. Our findings suggest these species do not depend on recolonisation for recovery, and that the bush rat will follow a nucleated recovery, expanding from topographic refugia. Thus, connectivity-reducing management activities, such as salvage logging and firebreak and road construction, may not affect the early stages of population recovery in remaining stands of burnt forest. Rather, ongoing recovery is likely to be limited by demographic rates and resource availability. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Population Dynamics of Spotted Owls in the Sierra Nevada, California
AN  - 811316208
AB  - The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is the only spotted owl subspecies not listed as threatened or endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act despites petitions to list it as threatened. We conducted a meta-analysis of population data for 4 populations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and management conditions in these mountain ranges. We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and for all study areas combined (meta-analysis) using model selection or model-averaging based on maximum-likelihood estimation. We followed a formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other spotted owl meta-analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival between male and female owls. Model-averaged mean estimates of apparent survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 ± 0.021 for females at LAS to 0.890 ± 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for adults at ELD, and for second-year subadults and adults at SKC. The meta-analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls, confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas. We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS showed an alternate-year trend in reproductive output, with higher output in even-numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988 ± 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 ± 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 ± 0.106 for SIE, and 0.555 ± 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest temporal variation. Meta-analysis confirmed that reproductive output varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults, followed by second-year subadults, and then by first-year subadults. We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate of change. Modeling indicated that λ^sub t^ (λ^sub t^ is the finite rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized Jolly-Seber estimator [Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean estimated λ^sub t^ for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95% CI = 0.952-1.066) for ELD; 0.973 (95% CI = 0.946-1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95% CI = 0.966-1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95% CI = 0.947-1.068) for SKC. The best meta-analysis model of population trend indicated that λ varied across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our estimates of realized population change (Δ^sub t^; Franklin et al. 2004), which we estimated as the product ... were based on estimates of λ^sub t^ from individual study areas and did not require estimating annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in each subsequent year. Similar to ... on which they were based, these ... showed evidence of decline over the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new territorial individuals at time t/number of territorial individuals at time t - 1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta-analysis. This PVA was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95% confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned the interval [0, 1] within 5-10 years. When we restricted inferences to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10% decline for SIE was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.09-0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.27-0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10% increase in 7 years for SIE was 0.23 (95% CI = 0.01-0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95% CI = 0.00-0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical population with mean λ = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7-year period than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the respiratory of information on our 4 study populations provide a data-rich template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on the owl. Specifically, ourt data can be used to evaluate the effect of management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline information for evaluating the status of the owl potential listing as threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is the only spotted owl subspecies not listed as threatened or endangered under the United States Endangered Species Act despite petitions to list it as threatened. We conducted a meta-analysis of population data for 4 populations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA, from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and management conditions in these mountain ranges. We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and for all study areas combined (meta-analysis) using model selection or model-averaging based on maximum-likelihood estimation. We followed a formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other spotted owl meta-analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival between male and female owls. Model-averaged mean estimates of apparent survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 ± 0.021 for females at LAS to 0.890 ± 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for adults at ELD, and for second-year subadults and adults at SKC. The meta-analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls, confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas. We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS showed an alternate-year trend in reproductive output, with higher output in even-numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988 ± 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 ± 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 ± 0.106 for SIE, and 0.555 ± 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest temporal variation. Meta-analysis confirmed that reproductive output varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults, followed by second-year subadults, and then by first-year subadults. We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate of change. Modeling indicated that λ^sub t^ (λ^sub t^ is the finite rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized Jolly-Seber estimator [Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean estimated λ^sub t^ for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95% CI = 0.952-1.066) for ELD; 0.973 (95% CI = 0.946-1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95% CI = 0.966-1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95% CI = 0.947-1.068) for SKC. The best meta-analysis model of population trend indicated that λ varied across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our estimates of realized population change (Δ^sub t^; Franklin et al. 2004), which we estimated as the product ..., were based on estimates of λ^sub t^ from individual study areas and did not require estimating annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in each subsequent year. Similar to ... on which they were based, these ... showed evidence of decline over the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new territorial individuals at time t/number of territorial individuals at time t - 1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta-analysis. This PVA was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95% confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned the interval [0, 1] within 5-10 years. When we restricted inferences to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10% decline for SIE was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.09-0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.27-0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10% increase in 7 years for SIE was 0.23 (95% CI = 0.01-0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95% CI = 0.00-0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical population with mean λ = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7-year period than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the repository of information on our 4 study populations provide a data-rich template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on the owl. Specifically, our data can be used to evaluate the effect of management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline information for evaluating the status of the owl for potential listing as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

T1  - Planned fires and invertebrate conservation in south east Australia
AN  - 750002189
AB  - Unusually intense wildfires in south east Australia in early February 2009 led to the deaths of 173 people in Victoria and massive loss of property, with several towns essentially obliterated. More than 450,000 ha were burned. The severity of those fires has led to calls for massively increased planned burning for fuel reduction, with a Government Enquiry (a Royal Commission) currently considering all aspects of the fires and future policy, to help safeguard life and property. Public concerns are naturally high, and any measures suggested to reduce the likelihood and severity of future fires must be appraised seriously. However, the conservation of Victoria's heritage of biodiversity is also of major concern, and--in particular--the outcomes of the more extensive use of fire for invertebrates have scarcely been heeded even in current prescriptions for planned burning. In this essay, we assemble some information on invertebrate interactions with fire in the region, and use this to suggest guides for improved fire management practices that are based more on scientific principles that focus on invertebrate conservation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Conservation status and management of the Gove Crow Euploea alcathoe enastri (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), a threatened tropical butterfly from the indigenous Aboriginal lands of north-eastern Arnhem Land, Australia
AN  - 750002188
AB  - The Gove Crow butterfly, Euploea alcathoe enastri Fenner, 1991, is restricted to Gove Peninsula of north-eastern Arnhem Land, a remote area of northern Australia. The subspecies has been listed as an Endangered taxon under federal and Northern Territory legislation, and represents one of only a few cases in the Australian Region in which a tropical butterfly has been targeted for species-orientated conservation. However, accurate status evaluation and conservation management have been hampered by lack of detailed information on spatial distribution, critical habitat, and the extent and severity of threatening processes. Surveys carried out during 2006-2008 indicate that the subspecies has a limited geographical range (extent of occurrence approximately 6,700 km^sup 2^) within which it is recorded from 11 locations or subpopulations embracing a total of 21 sites. Most sites comprise discrete habitat patches that are relatively small in area (<10 ha) within which adults are localised and occur in low abundance (<15 h^sup -1^). Of the four major habitat types in which E. alcathoe enastri was detected, only mixed paperbark tall open forest with rainforest elements in the understorey and rainforest edge (i.e. the ecotone between evergreen monsoon vine-forest and eucalypt/paperbark woodland) comprise breeding habitats. These habitat patches were always associated with permanent creeks or perennial groundwater seepages or springs that form swamplands, usually along drainage lines or flood plains in coastal or near coastal lowland areas. Major threats identified at the site level are habitat modification through altered fire regime and habitat disturbance by feral animals (buffalo, pig); potential threats at the landscape level include habitat loss through invasive species (grassy weeds, tramp ants) and global climate change. However, since critical breeding areas are subject to natural disturbance by both fire and flood, and occasionally cyclonic events, an optimal balance in disturbance regime is probably required to sustain breeding populations. Although E. alcathoe enastri is a narrow-range endemic that is ecologically specialised, there is no evidence of decline. Accordingly, the conservation status of the subspecies should be regarded as Near Threatened ('Conservation Dependent') under IUCN criteria. Components for an effective long-term conservation management plan of the butterfly and its habitat, which largely depend on the cooperation of traditional landowners and involvement of local indigenous ranger groups, are briefly discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Revegetation of Medusahead-Invaded Sagebrush Steppe
AN  - 756242496
AB  - Medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae [L.] Nevski) is an exotic annual grass invading western rangelands. Invasion by medusahead is problematic because it decreases livestock forage production, degrades wildlife habitat, reduces biodiversity, and increases fire frequency. Revegetation of medusahead-invaded sagebrush steppe is needed to increase ecosystem and economic productivity. Most efforts to revegetate medusahead-infested plant communities are unsuccessful because perennial bunchgrasses rarely establish after medusahead control. The effects of prescribed burning (spring or fall), fall imazapic application, and their combinations were evaluated for medusahead control and the establishment of seeded large perennial bunchgrasses. One growing season after treatments were applied, desert wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum [Fisch. ex Link] Schult.) and squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey) were drill seeded into treatment plots, except for the control treatment. Vegetation characteristics were measured for 2 yr postseeding (second and third year post-treatment). Medusahead was best controlled when prescribed burned and then treated with imazapic (P<0.05). These treatments also had greater large perennial bunchgrass cover and density compared to other treatments (P<0.05). The prescribed burned followed by imazapic application had greater than 10- and 8-fold more perennial bunchgrass cover and density than the control treatment, respectively. Prescribed burning, regardless of season, was not effective at controlling medusahead or promoting establishment of perennial bunchgrasses. The results of this study question the long-term effectiveness of using imazapic in revegetation efforts of medusahead-infested sagebrush steppe without first prescribed burning the infestation. Effective control of medusahead appears to be needed for establishment of seeded perennial bunchgrasses. The results of this study demonstrate that seeding desert wheatgrass and squirreltail can successfully revegetate rangeland infested with medusahead when medusahead has been controlled with prescribed fire followed by fall application of imazapic.

T1  - SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF FIRE ON BREEDING BIRDS IN SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN UPLAND FORESTS: A JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AN  - 751428988
AB  - We investigated how variation in fire severity (control or no fire; low, medium, and high severity fires) and interval (1-2 years vs. 3-6 years after fires) affected habitat and avian abundance, species diversity, richness, and evenness in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Fire severity and interval had significant implications for both habitat and avian communities. Species richness within 2 years of fires was on average 26% higher in areas receiving medium and high severity treatments than in unburned control units. Species diversity and species richness were markedly greater 3-6 years after fires within high severity treatments (12 and 44%, respectively), compared to unburned controls. Relative abundance and species evenness did not vary with fire severity or time since fire. The short-term effects of low severity fires, or high severity fires with short rotation periods (≤2 years) may have limited positive effects on avian communities. Facilitation of disturbance regimes including mid to high severity fires, which foster uneven-aged forests, can be an effective conservation tool for restoring avian communities.

T1  - Quantifying Disturbance in Terrestrial Communities: Abundance-Biomass Comparisons of Herpetofauna Closely Track Forest Succession
AN  - 750424129
AB  - Herpetofauna are frequently cited as ideal indicators for environmental and restoration monitoring due to their importance to ecological functioning, dominance of vertebrate biomass, and sensitivity to environmental change. Despite this relevance, herpetofauna have yet to be fully integrated into comprehensive, community-scale restoration monitoring methodologies. We tested the applicability of one such method, abundance-biomass comparisons (ABCs), to monitoring restoration success in a longleaf pine ecosystem currently undergoing restoration via prescribed burning. W statistics (a metric of environmental perturbation) for herpetofaunal assemblages in longleaf pine stands managed under varying fire intervals closely tracked forest succession from recently burned longleaf pine stands to those characterized by longer times since last burn and high levels of hardwood encroachment. Our results suggest that ABCs may be an applicable method for terrestrial restoration monitoring that encompasses entire faunal assemblages and allows for generality in restoration or disturbance response. We emphasize, however, that applications of this method and others need to take into account the specific ecological characteristics of study organisms and the natural history of study sites to avoid incorrect interpretations of disturbance response and inappropriate management recommendations.

T1  - Influence of Post-Clearing Treatment on the Recovery of Herbaceous Plant Communities in Amazonian Secondary Forests
AN  - 750423917
AB  - Secondary forests are an increasingly common feature in tropical landscapes worldwide and understanding their regeneration is necessary to design effective restoration strategies. It has previously been shown that the woody species community in secondary forests can follow different successional pathways according to the nature of past human activities in the area, yet little is known about patterns of herbaceous species diversity in secondary forests with different histories of land use. We compared the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plant communities in two types of Central Amazonian secondary forests--those regenerating on pastures created by felling and burning trees and those where trees were felled only. We also tested if plant density and species richness in secondary forests are related to proximity to primary forest. In comparison with primary forest sites, forests regenerating on non-burned habitats had lower herbaceous plant density and species richness than those on burned ones. However, species composition and abundance in non-burned stands were more similar to those of primary forest, whereas several secondary forest specialist species were found in burned stands. In both non-burned and burned forests, distance from the forest edge was not related to herbaceous density and species richness. Overall, our results suggest that the natural regeneration of herbaceous species in secondary tropical forests is dependent on a site's post-clearing treatment. We recommend evaluating the land history of a site prior to developing and implementing a restoration strategy, as this will influence the biological template on which restoration efforts are overlaid.

T1  - Nitrogen fertilization and fire act independently on foliar stoichiometry in a temperate steppe
AN  - 747979996
AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization, as a grassland management strategy, has been widely used to improve forage quality and increase the productivity of grasslands degraded by overstocking. It is widely accepted that N addition will alter ecosystem structure and function, and that these effects may be altered by natural disturbances, such as fire. We examined the effects of annual burning and N fertilization (17.5 g N m^sup -2^ year^sup -1^, at a surplus rate in order to simulate agriculture treatment) on foliar chemistry and stoichiometric ratios of eight dominant species (Leymus chinensis, Stipa grandis, Cleistogenes squarrosa, Potentilla bifurca, Thalictrum squarrosum, Artemisia frigida, Kochia prostrata and Caragana microphylla) in a temperate steppe in northern China. After 3 years of treatments, annual burning significantly increased soil extractable phosphorus (P) concentration but showed no effects on soil inorganic N concentration, whereas N fertilization caused a significant increase in inorganic N concentration but not of extractable P. Species differed substantially with respect to all nutritional and stoichiometric variables. Both annual burning and N fertilization caused significant increases in foliar N and P concentrations and thus decreases in carbon (C):N and C:P ratios. While annual burning showed no effects on N:P ratios, N fertilization produced higher N:P ratios. However, species responded idiosyncratically to both fire and N fertilization in terms of foliar N concentration, C:N and N:P ratio. In addition, there was no interaction between fire and N fertilization that affected all variables. This study suggests that both annual burning and N fertilization have direct impacts on plant elemental composition and that fire- and N addition-induced changes of community composition may have important consequences for plant-mediated biogeochemical cycling pathways in temperate steppe ecosystem.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bayesian Networks and Adaptive Management of Wildlife Habitat
AN  - 732998504
AB  - Adaptive management is an iterative process of gathering new knowledge regarding a system's behavior and monitoring the ecological consequences of management actions to improve management decisions. Although the concept originated in the 1970s, it is rarely actively incorporated into ecological restoration. Bayesian networks (BNs) are emerging as efficient ecological decision-support tools well suited to adaptive management, but examples of their application in this capacity are few. We developed a BN within an adaptive-management framework that focuses on managing the effects of feral grazing and prescribed burning regimes on avian diversity within woodlands of subtropical eastern Australia. We constructed the BN with baseline data to predict bird abundance as a function of habitat structure, grazing pressure, and prescribed burning. Results of sensitivity analyses suggested that grazing pressure increased the abundance of aggressive honeyeaters, which in turn had a strong negative effect on small passerines. Management interventions to reduce pressure of feral grazing and prescribed burning were then conducted, after which we collected a second set of field data to test the response of small passerines to these measures. We used these data, which incorporated ecological changes that may have resulted from the management interventions, to validate and update the BN. The network predictions of small passerine abundance under the new habitat and management conditions were very accurate. The updated BN concluded the first iteration of adaptive management and will be used in planning the next round of management interventions. The unique belief-updating feature of BNs provides land managers with the flexibility to predict outcomes and evaluate the effectiveness of management interventions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fuel Reduction Management Practices in Riparian Areas of the Western USA
AN  - 741099940; 20499233
AB  - Two decades of uncharacteristically severe wildfires have caused government and private land managers to actively reduce hazardous fuels to lessen wildfire severity in western forests, including riparian areas. Because riparian fuel treatments are a fairly new management strategy, we set out to document their frequency and extent on federal lands in the western U.S. Seventy-four USDA Forest Service Fire Management Officers (FMOs) in 11 states were interviewed to collect information on the number and characteristics of riparian fuel reduction treatments in their management district. Just under half of the FMOs surveyed (43%) indicated that they were conducting fuel reduction treatments in riparian areas. The primary management objective listed for these projects was either fuel reduction (81%) or ecological restoration and habitat improvement (41%), though multiple management goals were common (56%). Most projects were of small extent (93% < 300 acres), occurred in the wildland-urban interface (75%), and were conducted in ways to minimize negative impacts on species and habitats. The results of this survey suggest that managers are proceeding cautiously with treatments. To facilitate project planning and implementation, managers recommended early coordination with resource specialists, such as hydrologists and fish and wildlife biologists. Well-designed monitoring of the consequences of riparian fuel treatments on fuel loads, fire risk, and ecological effects is needed to provide a scientifically-defensible basis for the continued and growing implementation of these treatments.

T1  - Habitat Selection by Prairie Dogs in a Disturbed Landscape at the Edge of Their Geographic Range
AN  - 603218250
AB  - Although habitat attributes of black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies have been described for central and northern portions of the species' geographic range, little is known about these associations at the southern edge of this species' distribution. Because high-quality habitats are expected to be scarcer at the edge of the species' geographic range, different patterns of habitat selection might emerge in these populations. We analyzed habitat selection by black-tailed prairie dogs in a human-disturbed mosaic of desert grasslands and shrublands in northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico. We contrasted 151 used and 133 unused habitat units producing 11 case-control logistic regression models to explain site occupancy by prairie dogs with different combinations of environmental variables. Prairie dogs from Chihuahua occupy sites similar in most respects to sites in more northern regions, although these prairie dogs appear to be more tolerant of increased shrub density and reduced herbage cover. We found that site occupancy was best modeled by positive effects of soil moisture level, cover of forbs, cover of unpalatable vegetation, cover of bare ground, and amount of prairie-dog colony area within 1 km and by the inverse of altitude, shrub density, herbage height, and amount of hostile habitat within 1 km. The 2 most significant variables were herbage height and shrub density, which might reflect the prominent role that visibility plays in habitat selection by prairie dogs. In contrast, we found weak evidence that human features have significant impacts on site occupancy by prairie dogs. Our results support the prediction that environmental conditions of sites used by prairie dogs in edge regions partially differ from those observed in more northern latitudes. We suggest that reserve managers focus conservation efforts on areas with short vegetation, low density of shrubs, and high herbage cover, conditions that could be promoted by controlled burns, herbage mowing, and mechanical removal of shrubs.

T1  - White-Headed Woodpecker Nesting Ecology After Wildfire
AN  - 603210068
AB  - Within forests susceptible to wildfire and insect infestations, land managers need to balance dead tree removal and habitat requirements for wildlife species associated with snags. We used Mahalanobis distance methods to develop predictive models of white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus) nesting habitat in postfire ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated landscapes on the Fremont-Winema National Forests in south central Oregon, USA. The 1-km radius (314 ha) surrounding 45 nest sites was open-canopied before fire and a mosaic of burn seventies after wildfire. The 1-ha surrounding nests of white-headed woodpeckers had fewer live trees per hectare and more decayed and larger diameter snags than at non-nest sites. The leading cause of nest failure seemed to be predation. Habitat and abiotic features were not associated with nest survival. High daily survival rates and little variation within habitat features among nest locations suggest white-headed woodpeckers were consistently selecting high suitability habitats. Management activities that open the forest canopy and create conditions conducive to a mosaic burn pattern will probably provide suitable white-headed woodpecker nesting habitat after wildfire. When making postfire salvage logging decisions, we suggest that retention of larger, more decayed snags will provide nesting habitat in recently burned forests. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Experimental Test of Postfire Management in Pine Forests: Impact of Salvage Logging versus Partial Cutting and Nonintervention on Bird-Species Assemblages
AN  - 201354966
AB  - There is an intense debate about the effects of postfire salvage logging versus nonintervention policies on regeneration of forest communities, but scant information from experimental studies is available. We manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2 consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages. Salvage logged areas had species typical of open- and early-successional habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of mid- and late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50% and richness by 40%, approximately. The highest diversity at the landscape level (gamma diversity) resulted from a combination of all treatments. Salvage logging may be positive for bird conservation if combined in a mosaic with other, less-aggressive postfire management, but stand-wide management with harvest operations has undesirable conservation effects.

T1  - Anticipating Forest and Range Land Development in Central Oregon (USA) for Landscape Analysis, with an Example Application Involving Mule Deer
AN  - 206568360; 20300934
AB  - Forest policymakers, public lands managers, and scientists in the Pacific Northwest (USA) seek ways to evaluate the landscape-level effects of policies and management through the multidisciplinary development and application of spatially explicit methods and models. The Interagency Mapping and Analysis Project (IMAP) is an ongoing effort to generate landscape-wide vegetation data and models to evaluate the integrated effects of disturbances and management activities on natural resource conditions in Oregon and Washington (USA). In this initial analysis, we characterized the spatial distribution of forest and range land development in a four-county pilot study region in central Oregon. The empirical model describes the spatial distribution of buildings and new building construction as a function of population growth, existing development, topography, land-use zoning, and other factors. We used the model to create geographic information system maps of likely future development based on human population projections to inform complementary landscape analyses underway involving vegetation, habitat, and wildfire interactions. In an example application, we use the model and resulting maps to show the potential impacts of future forest and range land development on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) winter range. Results indicate significant development encroachment and habitat loss already in 2000 with development located along key migration routes and increasing through the projection period to 2040. The example application illustrates a simple way for policymakers and public lands managers to combine existing data and preliminary model outputs to begin to consider the potential effects of development on future landscape conditions.

T1  - Tree Injury and Mortality in Fires: Developing Process-Based Models
AN  - 2409021068
AB  - Wildland fire managers are often required to predict tree injury and mortality when planning a prescribed burn or when considering wildfire management options; and, currently, statistical models based on post-fire observations are the only tools available for this purpose. Implicit in the derivation of statistical models is the assumption that they are strictly applicable only for the species or conditions for which they were developed. The result has been a profusion of separate models of uncertain generality. A parallel research effort, the process approach, has been directed at modeling tree injury and mortality by directly simulating the energy-transfer process from the fire to the exterior surface of the plant, and thence into roots, stems, and foliage. Process models can currently predict stem or tree death if certain injury thresholds are reached. We present a brief review of the current understanding of the biophysical processes causing fire-induced plant injury, and focus on the challenges associated with defining boundary conditions, initial conditions, and thermal and physical properties required for modeling plant heating and tissue necrosis. We argue for integration of statistical and process approaches to predicting tree injury and mortality wherein process models provide inputs for statistical models. Research gaps that hinder the application of process-based tree injury and mortality models include linkage of fire effects models with combustion models (especially coupled fire-atmosphere models) through the boundary conditions required for simulating tissue heating, descriptions of live tree thermal and physical characteristics, and better understanding of the physiological basis for delayed fire-caused mortality and the interactions between fire injury and second-order causes of mortality such as diseases and insects.

T1  - Nest Survival of Western Bluebirds Using Tree Cavities in Managed Ponderosa Pine Forests of Central Washington
AN  - 500846250
AB  - We examined the association of temporal and spatial factors with nest survival of Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana ) nesting in tree cavities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa ) forests along the east slope of the Cascade Mountains, Washington. All study areas were managed for timber production through planned harvests or postfire salvage logging. Bluebirds laid a mean clutch of 5.3 ± 0.1 (SE) eggs (n  = 131), and successful nests fledged an average of 4.5 ± 0.2 young (n  = 85). Using a model-selection framework, we found that nest survival was a function of clutch size and treatment and that there was a quadratic effect of nest age. Daily survival rates decreased after the onset of incubation, then increased through the nestling period, and were higher for clutches with ≥5 eggs and in stands that were burned and salvaged. Survivorship over the entire period for clutches (n  = 131 nests) with ≤4, 5, and ≥6 eggs was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.65), 0.61 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.80), and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively. Vegetation variables associated with nest sites did not significantly affect nest survival. Predation accounted for the most nest failures (34% of nests). We suggest that parental defense of nests accounts for the quadratic effect of nest age, with adult bluebirds defending nests more aggressively as nestlings approach fledging, and that bluebirds laying larger clutches are older, more experienced birds, resulting in greater nest survival.

T1  - Isolating the lightning ignition regime from a contemporary background fire regime in east-central Florida, USA
AN  - 230524919
AB  - Anthropogenic influences have altered most fire regimes. Fire management programs often try to mimic natural fire regimes to maintain fuels and sustain native fire-dependent species. Lightning is the natural ignition source in Florida, substantiating the need for understanding lightning fire incidence. Sixteen years of lightning data (1986-2003, excluding 1987 and 2002 due to missing data) from the NASA Cloud to Ground Lightning Surveillance System and fire ignition records were used to quantify the relationship between lightning incidence and ignitions on Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. There were 230 lightning fires with an average of 14 ignitions per year, primarily in July, and only one winter ignition. Precipitation influenced the efficiency of lightning ignitions, particularly July precipitation. We found that negative polarity strikes caused the majority of ignitions. Pine flatwoods was ignited more frequently than expected given equal chance of ignition among landcover types. About half (51%) of detected fires were instantaneous ignitions and the other 49% were delayed an average of 2 days. This information is useful for paramaterizing fire regime models and for mimicking the natural fire regime through fire prescriptions on these properties and throughout the southeastern United States. These methods may be useful in fire-maintained systems globally. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Short-Term Effects of Thinning and Burning Restoration Treatments on Avian Community Composition, Density, and Nest Survival in the Eastern Cascades Dry Forests, Washington
AN  - 197715769
AB  - We monitored the short-term (<3 years) response of land birds to restoration treatments (thin, burn, and thin-burn) in dry forests located on the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington. Overall avian community composition did not change among the treatments. However, individual species responses varied with the chipping sparrow showing lower density in treatments, whereas hermit thrush, mountain chickadee, white-headed woodpecker, western bluebird, American crow, and common raven increased in treatment units. Daily survival rates of nesting guilds were similar in treated versus control stands; however, burn-only showed lower daily survival rates compared with other treatments. Additional research is needed to validate this result. Cavity-nesters (mountain chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and house wren) and foliage-nesters (chipping sparrow) used trees that were larger in diameter than available regardless of the treatment. Our results, in combination with other results from this study area, provide important implications for managers: (1) thin-burn treatments were effective at restoring habitat for several avian focal species; (2) spring burn treatments should be carefully designed to achieve desired restoration objectives; (3) large trees provide important habitat functions and are a key component for maintaining or restoring the viability of focal avian species; and (4) additional research is needed to better understand the effects of spring burning and the long-term effects of dry forest restoration treatments.

T1  - Commercial Development Morels in the East Kootenay, British Columbia
AN  - 2124008216
AB  - The study builds on fieldwork done in the East Kootenay region of British Columbia (B.C.) on the habitat and productivity of the morel mushroom. In particular the study collects what is known and what is yet to be understood about the relationship of forest fires to the production of morels. It explores some of the difficulties of commercializing the morel harvest, when the locations and quantities of morel production are inconsistent from year to year and are dependent on normally unpredictable forest events such as fire and insect attack. On the basis of current information the authors examine the benefits of including morel production as a consideration in the planning of forest management strategies. They also point to key areas of additional morel research that could be useful in supporting a regular healthy commercial harvest.

T1  - Isolation and characterisation of polymorphic microsatellite markers in the western ringtail possum, <i>Pseudocheirus</i>&#xa0;<i>occidentalis</i>
AN  - 2430231769
AB  - We report on the development of 14 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers from the western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), a “threatened” (Vulnerable) arboreal marsupial, endemic to the biodiversity hotspot region of south-west of Western Australia. The markers were developed to obtain population genetic data to quantify any changes which may be associated with increasing geographical fragmentation. We describe the diversity among 66 unrelated (adult) P. occidentalis individuals. Overall, the markers produced between three to eight alleles per locus and observed and expected heterozygosities of 59% and 69%, respectively. Due to predation by introduced foxes, urban encroachment changes in fire regime and the resultant levels of fragmentation in its range, these microsatellite markers are an important tool for evaluating population genetic information and for prioritising populations for conservation management.

T1  - Application of Semiochemicals to Assess the Biodiversity of Subcortical Insects following an Ecosystem Disturbance in a Sub-boreal Forest
AN  - 211197141; 20066478
AB  - From 2000 through 2003 we used semiochemical-baited traps in northeastern Minnesota, USA, to assess changes in assemblages of subcortical forest insects after a catastrophic wind storm in 1999 and subsequent (1999-2000) fuel-reduction activities (salvage-logging and prescribed-burning). We determined the regional efficacy of fifteen semiochemical blends (pheromones and kairomones) as attractants for target and non-target subcortical insect species (Coleoptera: Anthribidae, Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Cleridae, Cucujidae, Curculionidae, Histeridae, Nemonychidae, Salpingidae, Scolytidae, Tenebrionidae, and Hymenoptera: Siricidae). During the four summers, we trapped 86,471 subcortical insects (143 species) in baited and unbaited Lindgren funnel traps, and 500 beetles (44 species) in baited and unbaited pitfall traps. We report 23 new state collection records of subcortical insects from Minnesota. Trap catches of subcortical insects were greatest in the wind-disturbed areas 2 years after the event, and declined thereafter. Similar trends were observed for subcortical insects in the burned areas. Both wind-disturbance and burning increased the subcortical insect species richness and diversity on the landscape. The subcortical insect species compositions of the salvaged and burned forest areas differed from those of the undisturbed and wind-disturbed areas. Trap catches of subcortical insects in response to semiochemical treatments also varied with year of sampling and land-area treatment. The greatest diversity of subcortical beetle species was in traps baited with attractants for the scolytids, Dendroctonus valens [(+)-[alpha]-pinene and (-)-[beta]-pinene] and Dryocoetes spp. [exo-brevicomin and (-)-[alpha]-pinene], perhaps reflecting the generic nature of the baits. The most distinct species compositions were collected in response to the woodborer and Dendroctonus simplex baits, whereas the species compositions in traps with the D. valens and Dryocoetes spp. baits, and the unbaited funnel trap were the most similar. The variation in trap catch with time and across landscapes suggests that the responses of subcortical insects to semiochemicals are more complex than previously appreciated. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Recolonization of a burned Mediterranean area by terrestrial gastropods
AN  - 222371601
AB  - Wildfires are common natural perturbations in Mediterranean ecosystems. Their frequency and extent have changed in recent decades to become one of the main ecological problems for wildlife. The response of fauna to wildfires depends greatly on the life histories and biological traits of each species. Terrestrial gastropods have limited mobility, and their presence is restricted by the vegetal and abiotic characteristics of habitats. For this reason, they are expected to have a low ability to recolonize burned areas. We have explored their survivorship and recolonization patterns according to the cryptic-refuge and fire-edge models in a Mediterranean protected area affected by a large fire in August 2003. The low number of species recorded at burned sites demonstrates the negative effects of a wildfire on the richness of gastropod assemblages 4 years after the perturbation. However, the total number of living individuals did not vary between burned and unburned areas, suggesting an after-fire shift in dominant species from woodland to open-space species. Forest species with wide European distributions dominated in unburned sites, whereas open-space species and xerophytic Mediterranean species were present at burned sites. These differences were evident even at the burned sites closest to the unburned forest, suggesting low recolonization rates from the fire edge. By contrast, the abundance of xerophilous species as well as isolated records of mesophilous species in the burned areas suggests the survival of small populations and further recuperation after fire following the cryptic-refuge model.

T1  - Measuring the postfire resilience of a bird-vegetation system: a 28-year study in a Mediterranean oak woodland
AN  - 199345020; 19727831
AB  - Despite numerous studies on the response of Mediterranean ecosystems to fire, few have measured the respective resilience of vegetation and fauna compartments. For 28 years, we conducted an annual monitoring of avifauna composition and vegetation structure (cover profile) following a severe wildfire in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) stand in southern France. Our aim was to estimate the time necessary for this bird-vegetation system to return to a state analogous to its pre-fire state. In the burned plots, low herbaceous and shrub layers were gradually replaced by higher, woody layers of vegetation. Neither bird species richness nor inter-annual bird species turnover showed significant differences from one year to the next over the study period. In contrast, bird species composition did change steadily, leading to an almost complete replacement of early-successional species by late-successional ones. Using the first axes of multivariate analyses as 'proxy variables' of vegetation or avifauna recoveries, we estimated by extrapolation the recovery times of these two ecosystem components at ca. 50 and 35 years, respectively. Towards the end of the study period, the rate of change in avifauna composition decreased comparatively to that of vegetation structure. Our results show that holm oak woodlands are highly resilient and seem to tolerate a ~50-year fire interval, even if it remains to be assessed how resilient they would be in the case of increased fire frequency. More generally, our multivariate approach, which allows comparative estimations of resilience in different components of an ecosystem using qualitative as well as quantitative criteria, could be applied to various case studies in disturbance and restoration ecology.

T1  - Habitat Use and Selection by California Spotted Owls in a Postfire Landscape
AN  - 234225476
AB  - Forest fire is often considered a primary threat to California sported owls (Strix occidental occidentalis) because fire has the potential to rapidly alter owl habitat. We examined effects of fire on 7 radiomarked California spotted owls from 4 territories by quantifying use of habitat for nesting, roosting, and foraging according to severity of burn in and near a 610-km^sup 2^ fire in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, USA, 4 years after fire. Three nests were located in mixed-conifer forests, 2 in areas of moderate- severity burn, and one in an area of low-severity burn, and one nest was located in an unbumed area of mixed-conifer-hardwood forest. For roosting during the breeding season, spotted owls selected low-severity burned forest and avoided moderate- and high-severity burned areas; unburned forest was used in proportion with availability. Within 1 km of the center of their foraging areas, spotted owls selected all severities of burned forest and avoided unburned forest. Beyond 1.5 km, there were no discernable differences in use patterns among burn severities. Most owls foraged in high-severity burned forest more than in all other burn categories; high-severity burned forests had greater basal area of snags and higher shrub and herbaceous cover, parameters thought to be associated with increased abundance or accessibility of prey. We recommend that burned forests within 1.5 km of nests or roosts of California spotted owls not be salvage-logged until long-term effects of fire on spotted owls and their prey are understood more fully.

T1  - Habitat Quality Following Mid-Rotation Treatment in Conservation Reserve Program Pines
AN  - 234222925
AB  - Evaluation of habitat management practices at mid-rotation is needed for pine (Pinus spp.) plantations enrolled in cost-share programs. Plantations established in abandoned agricultural fields may have different understory plant communities than those with a long history of forest cover. Mid-rotation pine plantations often have a hardwood midstory that limits development of early succession habitat components important to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; bobwhite). We treated with imazapyr herbicide and prescribed burning (HB) 11 thinned, 13-22-year-old pine plantations in the Upper East Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi, USA, enrolled in cost-share programs, and we sampled plant community response during the summers of 2003 and 2004, years 1 and 2 posttreatment. The HB treatment created a more open structure with greater coverage of debris and herbaceous plants than in controls. Increased forb coverage in HB plots yielded a more seasonally diverse foraging base for deer. Horizontal screening cover developed slowly in HB plots and was more abundant in control plots. Autumn and winter food-plant coverage for bobwhite was provided by either treatment, but accessibility was improved in HB plots relative to controls. Bobwhite nesting cover was improved by HB relative to controls but was still of marginal quality. Brood-rearing habitat was precluded in both treatments due to lack of bare ground. Our results indicate that imazapyr followed by prescribed fire is a beneficial tool for creating early succession habitat for deer and bobwhite in mid-rotation pine plantations with a history of agricultural use. Continued management with periodic prescribed fire and overstory thinning should be instituted to maintain and perhaps improve these conditions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Deer Forage Response to Herbicide and Fire in Mid-Rotation Pine Plantations
AN  - 234225922
AB  - Mid-rotation management practices for pine (Pinus spp.) plantations enrolled in cost-share programs have not been widely evaluated for wildlife. Mid-rotation pine plantations often have a substantial hardwood mid-story that limits growth of desirable understory forage species important to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer). We treated with imazapyr herbicide and prescribed burning (HB) 11 thinned, 13-22-year-old loblolly pine (P. taeda) plantations in the Upper Coastal Plain (UCP; n = 5) and the Lower Coastal Plain (LCP; n = 6) of Mississippi, USA, enrolled in cost-share programs. We then sampled these plantations for production of important deer forages during July of 2003 and 2004, years 1 and 2 posttreatment. Deer foraging habitat was clearly improved by the HB treatment in both regions by year 2. Forb species of annual importance to deer increased in percent cover and biomass in the UCP and in biomass in the LCP. We estimated nutritional carrying capacity using a target diet quality of 14% crude protein; estimates in HB plots were 3 times greater than controls in the UCP and 19 times greater in the LCP. Although UCP sites had baseline carrying capacities nearly 8 times greater than LCP sites, the greater relative response to HB in the LCP eliminated the regional difference. Our results indicate that imazapyr herbicide treatment followed by prescribed fire is a beneficial tool for deer management in mid-rotation pine plantations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using Remote Sensing to Evaluate the Influence of Grassland Restoration Activities on Ecosystem Forage Provisioning Services
AN  - 213842900
AB  - As valuation of ecosystem goods and services derived from ecological processes becomes increasingly important in environmental decision-making, the need to quantify how restoration activities influence ecosystem function has grown more urgent, particularly within income-generating or subsistence-providing landscapes where economic needs and biodiversity goals must be balanced. However, quantification of restoration effects is often hindered by logistical issues, which include (1) the difficulty of systematically monitoring responses over large areas and (2) lack or loss of comparison sites necessary for assessing treatment effect. We explored the use of remote sensing to quantify the effects of native grass seeding and prescribed burns on ecosystem forage provisioning services within a California (U.S.A.) rangeland landscape. We used Landsat time series to monitor forage (green biomass) dynamics within 296 ha of treatment areas--distributed throughout a 36-km2 watershed--for 6 years and to identify post hoc comparison areas when a priori comparisons were lacking. Remote sensing analysis documented gains and losses in forage provisioning services due to restoration efforts and provided critical information for adaptive management. Our results demonstrate the degree to which invaded grasslands can be resistant to change and suggest that increasing the functional complexity of restoration mixes might help increase forage availability and reduce opportunities for weed reinvasion.

T1  - Quantifying historical changes in habitat availability for endangered species: use of pixel- and object-based remote sensing
AN  - 233432554
AB  - Establishing medium- to long-term trends in habitat availability for endangered species is important for determining the causes of historical population declines and for designing effective management plans. For some animal species, relative habitat availability can be estimated using time series of aerial photographs, but the limited information in old black-and-white images makes it challenging to estimate accurately at large spatial scales. Australia's most endangered snake, the broad-headed snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides, requires unshaded, exfoliated sandstone rocks for shelter. Using digitized aerial photographs of four sites from 1941 and 1971, and a Quickbird satellite image from 2006, we estimated the trend in habitat availability for a well-studied population of H. bungaroides in New South Wales. We did this using both traditional, pixel-based classifications and a more recently developed object-based approach. Both classification methods revealed substantial, monotonic decreases (by 24-77%) in the percentage cover of bare rock from 1941 to 2006 at all sites, with concomitant (although non-monotonic) net increases in percentage tree-canopy cover of 3-70%. The cover of herbaceous and low-shrub vegetation appeared variable and was poorly resolved in the classifications. Both classification methods yielded adequate (> 70%) accuracy for most images, but the object-based classifications were consistently more accurate than the pixel-based classifications and performed better when analysing images (from 1971) with comparatively low resolution. Our study indicates that habitat availability for broad-headed snakes has decreased considerably over 65 years due to increased shading from vegetation, and that object-based image analysis is a promising tool for assessing habitat trends using historical photographs. Multiple studies have reported woody-vegetation increases over multi-decadal time-scales in Australia and elsewhere, but few have tied these trends to habitat availability for animal species of concern. The phenomenon we document may therefore be quite widespread, and advances in remote sensing (including applications and refinements of the methods presented here) will be invaluable for revealing these trends and designing ameliorative management strategies. Management plans to conserve broad-headed snakes and similarly threatened species should include either controlled burns or regular targeted removal of vegetation, preferably after a rigorous comparison of the relative economic and biological costs and benefits of each.

T1  - Dealing with threats: Integrating science and management
AN  - 219597574
AB  - Threats to biodiversity are pervasive and diverse. The management of these threats is the major focus of conservation biology. We briefly reviewed the taxonomy of direct threats to biodiversity as a means of examining legislated planning actions and strategies for managing threatening processes in eastern Australia and propose a simple classification of five general types of threat. These include the major threats of destruction and fragmentation of habitat and global climate change; threats that relate directly to changes in disturbance regimes (e.g. fire and water); threats related to reduced functionality of biological interactions or life-cycle processes (e.g. due to invasions of exotic species); and over-exploitation affecting specific groups of plant and animal species. We applied this five-level classification to the listings of key threatening processes under legislation in three Australian jurisdictions (Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria). A small core group of threats are currently common to all three jurisdictions, including clearing of native vegetation, climate change and particular alien predators and diseases. The bulk of listings reflect differences in emphasis between jurisdictions, with the Commonwealth having not listed threats related to weeds or disturbance regimes.              To manage all types of threats, we need a clear understanding of cause and effect combined with adaptive management strategies for amelioration. We use selected case studies to show how a process-based understanding of threats can be incorporated into conservation management. In fire-prone ecosystems in New South Wales, for example, threats posed by increased fire frequency have been addressed in fire planning by prescribing management thresholds, derived from knowledge of the limits set by seed bank dynamics in relation to species persistence. Monitoring of species after fire allows re-evaluation of recommended intervals. In arid and semi-arid systems, grazing by introduced herbivores has disrupted the recruitment of new individuals into plant populations, resulting in long-term decline of a number of perennial plant species across extensive proportions of their ranges. In conjunction with long-term monitoring of recruitment patterns at selected locations, control of introduced herbivores is being used to address this threat. Finally, strategies for dealing with threats of a changing climate (including managing the capacity of species to disperse across the landscape) must include strategies for minimizing habitat loss and on-site management of existing threats.

T1  - Adaptive management in practice: Conservation of a threatened plant population
AN  - 219586176
AB  - We applied an adaptive management approach to reduce extinction risks faced by a disjunct and ecologically significant population of Black Cypress Pine ( Callitris endlicheri ), listed as an endangered population on the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. In summer 2001-2002, an unplanned fire burnt the population, resulting in mortality of most standing plants. Concerns were raised about the potential impact of herbivores, particularly feral Rusa Deer ( Cervus timorensis ), on the recruitment of post-fire seedlings that might replace the loss of fire-killed standing plants. We applied an adaptive management approach to detect trends in the population following the fire, and to evaluate and trial in situ management options for mitigating threats to the remaining plants. Post-fire monitoring detected continuing declines in both the remaining adult population and the post-fire cohort of seedlings, and identified browsing by Deer as a serious and ongoing threat to the population. We designed a controlled experiment, with the aid of natural and artificial 'nurse plants' to assess the effects of herbivore exclusion on seedling growth and survival, and to test for differences in those effects under alternative management strategies. The experiment was designed and implemented with little cost other than field time and with logistic constraints on replication. By protecting exposed seedlings from browsing using woody debris, we were able to significantly increase seedling growth and survival, and to quickly arrest the population decline. Our results suggest that excluding Deer from the population by more permanent means will have a significant positive effect on its long-term persistence. Our case study demonstrates the utility of adaptive management approaches in threatened species conservation, their feasibility even under severe budgetary and logistical constraints, and how ongoing monitoring and experimentation are crucial for successful management of biodiversity.

T1  - Breeding habitat use and the future management of the critically endangered Southern Corroboree Frog
AN  - 219553379
AB  - The Southern Corroboree Frog ( Pseudophryne corroboree ) is one of Australia's most critically endangered frog species. The species occurs entirely within Kosciuszko National Park, which has a history of cattle grazing (up to the 1970s). A consequence of cattle grazing has been a significant reduction in the extent of montane and sub-alpine peat-bog systems that the species uses as breeding habitat. Furthermore, climate change and associated increased wildfire frequency is expected to further reduce the extent and quality of peat bogs throughout the Australian Alps. In this study, we investigated habitat selection for breeding pools and nest sites within peat-bog systems in order to inform the conservation management of the species and guide other management practices being undertaken in peat bogs where this species occurs. Occupancy of breeding males at bog pools was found to be positively associated with increasing pool area, water depth and mid-day temperature, and negatively associated with extent of bare substrate. The majority of breeding pools identified were ephemeral. Nest sites within vegetation where males call and where females deposit their eggs were located at mid-elevations in a range of vegetation types, with the majority of nests being within moss and sedge dominated by Sphagnum cristatum and Empodisma minor . We also found that male nest sites were not randomly distributed within the edges of pools, but were more often located in areas of loose vegetation. These results highlight the potential sensitivity of the Southern Corroboree Frog to predicted changes in peat-bog systems resulting from climate change such as earlier drying and a possible reduction in the size of bog pools. A monitoring programme focused on key features of the breeding habitat should be undertaken to provide a basis for developing and assessing management actions implemented in peat bogs occupied by this species.

T1  - Grassland Bird Responses to Land Management in the Largest Remaining Tallgrass Prairie
AN  - 201454372
AB  - Extensive habitat loss and changing agricultural practices have caused widespread declines in grassland birds throughout North America. The Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma--the largest remaining tallgrass prairie--is important for grassland bird conservation despite supporting a major cattle industry. In 2004 and 2005, we assessed the community, population, and demographic responses of grassland birds to the predominant management practices (grazing, burning, and haying) of the region, including grasslands restored under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). We targeted 3 species at the core of this avian community: the Dickcissel (Spiza americana), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna). Bird diversity was higher in native prairie hayfields and grazed pastures than CRP fields, which were dominated by Dickcissels. Although Dickcissel density was highest in CRP, their nest success was highest and nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Moluthrus ater) lowest in unburned hayfields (in 2004). Conversely, Grasshopper Sparrow density was highest in grazed pastures, but their nest success was lowest in these pastures and highest in burned hayfields, where cowbird parasitism was also lowest (in 2004). Management did not influence density and nest survival of Eastern Meadowlarks, which were uniformly low across the region. Nest success was extremely low (5-12%) for all 3 species in 2005, perhaps because of a record spring drought. Although the CRP has benefited grassland birds in agricultural landscapes, these areas may have lower habitat value in the context of native prairie. Hayfields may provide beneficial habitat for some grassland birds in the Flint Hills because they are mowed later in the breeding season than elsewhere in the Midwest. Widespread grazing and annual burning have homogenized habitat--and thus grassland-bird responses--across the Flint Hills. Diversification of management practices could increase habitat heterogeneity and enhance the conservation potential of the Flint Hills for grassland birds. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - After the fire: benefits of reduced ground cover for vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops)
AN  - 37219915; 3908456
AB  - Here we describe changes in ranging behavior and other activities of vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) after a wildfire eliminated grass cover in a large area near the study group's home range. Soon after the fire, the vervets ranged farther away from tall trees that provide refuge from mammalian predators, and moved into the burned area where they had never been observed to go before the fire occurred. Visibility at vervet eye-level was 10 times farther in the burned area than in unburned areas. They traveled faster, and adult females spent more time feeding and less time scanning bipedally in the burned area than in the unburned area. The burned area's greater visibility may have lowered the animals' perceived risk of predation there, and may have provided them with an unusual opportunity to eat acacia ants.

T1  - Threats and biodiversity in the mediterranean biome: [1]
AN  - 219538449
AB  - Global conservation assessments recognize the mediterranean biome as a priority for the conservation of the world's biodiversity. To better direct future conservation efforts in the biome, an improved understanding of the location, magnitude and trend of key threats and their relationship with species of conservation importance is needed.

              
Mediterranean-climate regions in California-Baja California, Chile, South Africa, Australia and the Mediterranean Basin.

              
We undertook a systematic, pan-regional assessment of threats in the mediterranean biome including human population density, urban area and agriculture. To realize the full implications of these threats on mediterranean biodiversity, we examined their relationship with species of conservation concern: threatened mammals at the global scale and threatened plants at the subecoregional scale in California, USA.

              
Across the biome, population density and urban area increased by 13% and agriculture by 1% between 1990 and 2000. Both population density and urban area were greatest in California-Baja California and least in Australia while, in contrast, agriculture was greatest in Australia and least in California-Baja California. In all regions lowlands were most affected by the threats analysed, with the exception of population density in the Chilean matorral. Threatened species richness had a significant positive correlation with population density at global and subecoregional scales, while threatened species were found to increase with the amount of urban area and decrease as the amount of natural area and unfragmented core area increased.

              
Threats to mediterranean biodiversity have increased from 1990 to 2000, although patterns vary both across and within the five regions. The need for future conservation efforts is further underlined by the positive correlation between species of conservation concern and the increase in population density over the last decade. Challenges to reducing threats extend beyond those analysed to include human-environmental interactions and their synergistic effects, such as urbanization and invasive species and wildfires.

T1  - Canopy Closure and Emigration by Juvenile Gopher Frogs
AN  - 234200811
AB  - Although studies have addressed effects of abrupt transitions in habitat type (e.g., forest-clear-cut or forest-field edges) on amphibian movements, little is known about effects of more subtle habitat transitions on patterns of migration and habitat use in amphibians. We used radiotelemetry to study movement patterns of juvenile gopher frogs (Rana capito) emigrating from ponds that were surrounded by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest that varied in structure as a result of fire suppression. Our primary purpose was to determine if frogs emigrate directionally from their natal ponds and select habitat at random during their first month following metamorphosis. We found that frogs emigrated in nonrandom directions from ponds that were surrounded by heterogeneous habitat and selected fire-maintained habitat that was associated with an open canopy, few hardwood trees, small amounts of leaf litter, and large amounts of wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana). Fire-maintained habitat contained higher densities of burrows excavated by gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) and small mammals, which are the primary refuge sites for both juvenile and adult gopher frogs. Frogs moved up to 691 m from their natal ponds, frequently crossed dirt roads, and even seemed to use these roads as migration corridors. To maintain suitable terrestrial habitat for gopher frogs, including habitat used by migrating individuals, it is important to apply frequent prescribed fire to uplands surrounding breeding ponds that lead all the way to the edges of breeding ponds, as well as through ponds during periodic droughts.

T1  - Does prescribed burning mean a threat to the rare satyrine butterfly Hipparchia fagi? Larval-habitat preferences give the answer
AN  - 219927049
AB  - The ecological effects of fire management, especially regarding arthropods are poorly investigated. Burning in winter was assumed to pose a threat to butterfly species hibernating as larvae. To assess the impact of prescribed burning on population viability, we analysed larval-habitat preferences of the highly endangered, xero-thermophilous butterfly Hipparchia fagi in vineyards of the Kaiserstuhl region (southern Germany). Microhabitat preference analyses for mature larvae and egg-laying females revealed a preference of H. fagi for Bromus erectus-dominated communities with sparse vegetation coverage and a distinct tuft growth of the host plant B. erectus on microclimatically benefited slopes. We explain the preference of B. erectus by a preference of vegetation structure. The grass tufts offer a suitable climatically buffered living space for larvae. Egg deposition took place on dry substrate at positions of high solar radiation, thus adapted to hot and dry microclimate. As the larval habitat was sparsely vegetated as well as generally legally protected, fire management was not applicable and therefore not affecting the populations. We think it is conceivable that H. fagi, occurring here at its northern range limit, might expand its larval habitat into denser, combustible B. erectus stands in the course of global warming. A change in habitat preferences would necessitate a re-evaluation of management options. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Shifts in N and P Budgets of Heathland Ecosystems: Effects of Management and Atmospheric Inputs
AN  - 210413909
AB  - In the present study we analyzed the combined effects of management (grazing, mowing, prescribed burning, sod-cutting) and atmospheric deposition on N and P budgets of heathland ecosystems (Lüneburger Heide nature reserve; N Germany). We hypothesize that management measures such as grazing and mowing can accelerate a deposition-induced imbalance of N and P pools as a result of a disproportionally high output of P. We analyzed management and deposition affected input-output flows of N and P and related them to changes in the nutritional status of Calluna vulgaris 5 years after treatment application. We found that grazing and mowing caused the highest net loss of P due to high P concentrations in the aboveground biomass. In contrast, prescribed burning only slightly affected P pools, as P remained in the system due to ash deposition. Management-mediated effects on N and P pools were mirrored in the nutritional status of Calluna vulgaris: at the grazed and mown sites, the P content of current season's shoots significantly decreased within 5 years after treatments, whereas the N content remained unchanged. We conclude that grazing and mowing can accelerate declining availability of P and, thus, accelerate a deposition-induced shift from N- to P-limited plant growth in the medium term. In the face of ongoing atmospheric N loads management schemes need to combine high- and low-intensity measures to maintain both a diverse structure and balanced nutrient budgets in the long term.

T1  - Effects of Weed-Management Burning on Reptile Assemblages in Australian Tropical Savannas
AN  - 201395326
AB  - Fire is frequently used for land management purposes and may be crucial for effective control of invasive non-native plants. Nevertheless, fire modifies environments and may affect nontarget native biodiversity, which can cause conflicts for conservation managers. Native Australian reptiles avoid habitat invaded by the alien plant rubber vine (Cryptostegia grandiflora) and may be susceptible to the impacts of burning, a situation that provides a model system in which to examine possible conservation trade-offs between managing invasive plants and maintaining native biodiversity. We used replicated, experimental fire treatments (unburned, dry-season burned, and wet-season burned) in 2 habitats (riparian and adjacent open woodland) to examine the short- (within 12 months of fire) and longer-term (within 3 years of fire) changes of reptile assemblages in response to wet- and dry-season burning for weed management in tropical savannas of northern Australia. Within 12 months of fire, abundances of the skink Carlia munda (Scincidae) were higher in the burned sites, but overall reptile composition was structured by habitat type rather than by effects of burning. Within 3 years of a fire, the effects of fire were evident. Reptiles, especially the gecko Heteronotia binoei (Gekkonidae), were least abundant in dry-season burned sites; litter-associated species, including Carlia pectoralis (Scincidae), were rarely observed in burned habitat; and there were fewer species in the wet-season burned sites. Reptile abundance was associated with vegetation structure, which suggests that fire-induced changes detrimentally altered the availability of resources for some reptiles, particularly leaf-litter species. Invasive alien plants, such as rubber vine, have severe effects on native biodiversity, and control of such species is a fundamental land management objective. Nevertheless, fire management of invasive alien plants may adversely affect native biodiversity, creating a conservation conundrum. In such scenarios, land managers will need to identify the most desired conservation goal and consider the consequences for native biota. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Vegetation Responses to Prescribed Burning of Grazed Shortgrass Steppe
AN  - 211989271
AB  - Over the past century, fire has been widely suppressed in the western Great Plains, in part because of the potential negative effects on forage production for livestock. More recently, interest in the use of prescribed fire in shortgrass steppe has increased because of the potential applications for wildlife management, control of unpalatable plant species, and restoration of historic disturbance regimes. We studied the effects of prescribed burns conducted during late winter on herbaceous production, forage nitrogen content, and plant species composition of shortgrass steppe on the Pawnee National Grassland in northeastern Colorado. Late-winter burns conducted in moderately grazed sites under a wide range of precipitation conditions during 1997-2001 did not negatively affect herbaceous production in either the first or the second postburn growing season. Burning followed by a severe drought in 2002 reduced production by 19% in the second postburn growing season of 2003. Burns temporarily suppressed the abundance of broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and prickly pear cactus (Opuntia polyacantha) and enhanced forage nitrogen content during May and June of the first postburn growing season. These findings suggest that, except following severe drought, prescribed burns conducted during late winter in grazed shortgrass steppe for objectives unrelated to livestock production can also have neutral or positive consequences for livestock.

T1  - Sex-Specific Habitat use by a Lekking Bustard: Conserv Implications for the Critically Endangered Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis Bengalensis) in an Intensifying Agroecosystem
AN  - 196453518
AB  - Understanding sexual differences in habitat use is important for effective conservation management, particularly with regard to polygynous species, the sexes of which may differ in their responses to land-use change. We examined sex-specific habitat use in the critically endangered Bengal Florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis  ), a polygynous bustard whose most important population occurs in traditionally farmed grasslands in the Tonle Sap floodplain, Cambodia. This habitat is undergoing rapid conversion to intensive dry-season rice production. Using radiotelemetry, we compared male and female breeding-season habitat selection and home-range sizes and configurations. The sexes differed in their spatial use of the lek and their ability to utilize anthropogenic habitat features. Both sexes avoided intensive dry-season rice fields. Males selected habitats related to low-intensity human activity, chiefly burned grassland, whereas females selected unburned grassland but also used unburned, uncultivated grassland in dry-season rice head-ponds. These differences reflect the species' breeding system, with males using open areas for display and females selecting cover. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the landscape heterogeneity associated with traditional human activity in maintaining the habitat mosaics necessary for the contrasting breeding-season requirements of male and female Bengal Floricans. Two-thirds of tagged females may have left the lek to nest elsewhere, which suggests that protecting habitat in which males display will not be a sufficient conservation response for such lekking species. Both sexes are detrimentally affected by agricultural intensification within the Tonle Sap, and encouragement of industrial rice production to spare more "natural" habitats elsewhere is likely to be counterproductive for this globally threatened flagship species.

T1  - SHORT-TERM RESPONSE OF HERPETOFAUNA TO VARIOUS BURNING REGIMES IN THE SOUTH TEXAS PLAINS
AN  - 885297683
AB  - Data on effects of fire on herpetofauna generally are lacking. With increased use of prescribed fire to manage rangelands in South Texas for wildlife and livestock, a better understanding of effects of fire on the herpetofauna is needed. We investigated effects of combinations of winter and summer prescribed fire on rangeland sites on the Chaparral Wildlife Management Area in southern Texas. Dormant-season fires had little effect on diversity and abundance of the herpetofauna. Inclusion of growing-season fire into the burning regime tended to increase diversity and abundance of grassland species, such as the six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus). Although our experimental design limits interpretation of results to the study site, our data suggest that prescribed fire may be used to manage rangelands in South Texas without negative affects on the herpetofauna. A varied burning regime is recommended to increase herpetofaunal diversity. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Bushfire and the Malthusian guillotine: survival of small mammals in a refuge in Nadgee Nature Reserve, south-eastern New South Wales
AN  - 864539851
AB  - Following an intense bushfire in December 1972, small mammals were sampled from November 1973 to June 1976 on a few hectares of unburnt, grassy river flat in the Nadgee Nature Reserve, New South Wales. Hindsight shows the importance of these small unburnt patches as refuges for small mammals. A surprising proportion of wildlife survives a large bushfire, but the post-fire population is in extremis, confronted by famine and exposed to increased predation. All small-mammal species on a forest plot burnt in the '72 fire disappeared. On the unburnt flat, five species were encountered and continued to survive. There was a common theme to all five populations in the refuge; incessant flux, many births and disappearances, virtually static overall population. The oft-cited ideas of T. Robert Malthus, although seen by some as old-fashioned and wrong when applied to human populations, lend power to our understanding of population events in the small refuge surviving the '72 fire. The theme is clear: the populations of small mammals on the flat survived, but barely, as the small numbers in each year's winter show, and it is only by the operation of the "Malthusian Guillotine" that they are able to do so. The guillotine is an apt metaphor for the survival process; its operation is stark, but it is efficient, and it is mercifully brief. The conservation implications from this study are striking. The most important being the vital role played by refuges following an extensive and intense fire. In an era of global warming and increasing predictions of the likelihood of bushfires rising, such matters will loom even larger. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Responses in Bird Communities to Wildland Fires in Southern California
AN  - 2409023324
AB  - There is a growing body of literature covering the responses of bird species to wildland fire events. Our study was unique among these because we investigated the effects of large-scale wildland fires on entire bird communities across multiple vegetation types. We conducted avian point counts during the breeding seasons for two years before and two years after the Cedar and Otay Fires in 2003 in southern California. Our balanced sampling effort took place at two sites, one low-elevation and one high-elevation, each containing replicate stations (burned and unburned) within five vegetation types: chaparral, coastal sage scrub, grassland, oak woodland, and riparian. Although fire caused some degree of change in the vegetation structure at all of our impacted survey points, we found that the post-fire shrub and tree cover was significantly lower in only two of the vegetation types within the low-elevation site, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. We found no significant changes in cover at the high-elevation site. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we tested whether the fires were associated with a change in bird species diversity, community structure, and the relative abundance of individuals within a species. We found that species diversity changed in only one circumstance: it increased in coastal sage scrub at the low-elevation site. Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in the post-fire bird community structure in the low-elevation chaparral, low-elevation coastal sage scrub, and the high-elevation grassland communities. Vegetation characteristics altered by fire, such as decreases in shrub and tree cover, influenced the changes we observed in the bird communities. The relative abundance of some species (lazuli bunting [Passerina amoena] and horned lark [Eremophila alpestris]) significantly increased after the fires, while other species declined significantly (Anna’s hummingbird [Calypte anna], wrentit [Chamaea fasciata], and bushtit [Psaltriparus minimus]). We detected mixed results for the spotted towhee (Pipilo maculatus), which increased in burned chaparral and declined in burned coastal sage scrub within the low-elevation site. We suggest that the observed responses of birds to these fires may be attributed to: (1) the availability of nearby unburned refugia, (2) the continued suitability of post-fire vegetation at the study sites, and (3) the generally high mobility of this taxon.

T1  - Male Seminole Bat Winter Roost-Site Selection in a Managed Forest
AN  - 234178839
AB  - Understanding year-round roost-site selection is essential for managing forest bat populations. From January to March, 2004 to 2006, we used radiotelemetry to investigate winter roost-site selection by Seminole bats (Lasiurus seminolus) on an intensively managed landscape with forested corridors in southeastern South Carolina, USA. We modeled roost-site selection with logistic regression and used Akaike's Information Criterion for small samples (AIC^sub c^) and Akaike weights to select models relating roost-site selection to plot- and landscape-level variables. We tracked 20 adult male bats to 71 individual roosts. Bats used a variety of roosting structures, including the canopy of overstory trees, understory vegetation, pine (Pinus spp.) needle clusters, and leaf litter. Roost height, structure type, and habitat type were influenced by changes in minimum nightly temperature. On warmer nights, bats selected taller trees in mature forest stands, but when minimum nightly temperatures were <4° C, bats typically were found roosting on or near the forest floor in mid-rotation stands. We recommend avoiding prescribed burning in mid-rotation stands on days when the previous night's temperature is <4 °C to minimize potential disturbance and direct mortality of bats roosting on or near the forest floor. We encourage forest managers to incorporate seasonal changes in roost-site selection to create year-round management strategies for forest bats in managed landscapes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - POSTFIRE WOODPECKER FORAGING IN SALVAGE-LOGGED AND UNLOGGED FORESTS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA/Forrajeo de Pájaros Carpinteros en Bosques Quemados Con y Sin Extracción de Madera en la Sierra Nevada
AN  - 211253460
AB  - In forests, high-severity burn patches--wherein most or all of the trees are killed by fire--often occur within a mosaic of low- and moderate-severity effects. Although there have been several studies of postfire salvage-logging effects on bird species, there have been few studies of effects on bird species associated with high-severity patches in forests that have otherwise burned at lower severities. From 2004 to 2006, we investigated the foraging presence or absence of three woodpecker species, the Black-backed (Picoides arcticus  ), Hairy (P.   villosus  ), and White-headed (P.   albolarvatus  ) Woodpeckers, within four different forest habitat conditions in Sierra Nevada conifer forests: unburned; moderate-severity and unlogged; high-severity and unlogged; and high-severity and logged. We found Black-backed Woodpecker foraging was restricted to unlogged high-severity patches. Hairy Woodpeckers foraged most in unlogged high-severity patches, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed no significant difference in presence among conditions. These results suggest that unlogged, high-severity forest is important habitat for the Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The "fire stick farming" hypothesis: Australian Aboriginal foraging strategies, biodiversity, and anthropogenic fire mosaics
AN  - 201403790
AB  - Aboriginal burning in Australia has long been assumed to be a "resource management" strategy, but no quantitative tests of this hypothesis have ever been conducted. We combine ethnographic observations of contemporary Aboriginal hunting and burning with satellite image analysis of anthropogenic and natural landscape structure to demonstrate the processes through which Aboriginal burning shapes arid-zone vegetational diversity. Anthropogenic landscapes contain a greater diversity of successional stages than landscapes under a lightning fire regime, and differences are of scale, not of kind. Landscape scale is directly linked to foraging for small, burrowed prey (monitor lizards), which is a specialty of Aboriginal women. The maintenance of small-scale habitat mosaics increases small-animal hunting productivity. These results have implications for understanding the unique biodiversity of the Australian continent, through time and space. In particular, anthropogenic influences on the habitat structure of paleolandscapes are likely to be spatially localized and linked to less mobile, "broad-spectrum" foraging economies.

T1  - Effects of Patch-Burn Management on Dickcissel Nest Success in a Tallgrass Prairie
AN  - 234225092
AB  - Grassland birds have declined more than any other North American habitat-associated bird community. Because most species of grassland birds evolved within heterogeneous landscapes created by the interaction of fire and grazing, traditional rangeland management that promotes homogeneity, including annual dormant-season burning combined with early-intensive grazing, might be partly responsible for these declines, especially in some regions of the Great Plains, USA. Recently, an alternative grassland management practice known as patchburning has been promoted as a means of restoring heterogeneity to grasslands by mimicking the grazing-fire interaction that once occurred on the prairie before European settlement. From 2003 to 2004, we examined effects of patch-burning and traditional management (annual burning followed by early-intensive grazing) on the reproductive success of dickcissels (Spiza americana) in tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma. We monitored 296 dickcissel nests and found that dickcissel nesting phenology differed between traditional and patch-burned pastures. Specifically, dickcissels tended to initiate their nests later in the traditional pasture. Mean number of eggs laid and fledglings produced were similar between the treatments, but nest densities were higher in traditional pastures. Predation was the predominant cause of nest failure and was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) parasitism was higher in traditional pastures than in patch-burned pastures. Overall, dickcissel nest success was higher in patch-burned pastures than in traditional pastures. The positive response of dickcissel nest success to patch-burn management provides further evidence that this practice can be a useful tool for grassland bird conservation. By creating a mosaic of different stature vegetation, patch-burn management enhances productivity of grassland bird species by providing a refuge area in the unburned patches that affords dickcissels and other nesting grassland birds some protection from the direct (e.g., trampling) and indirect (e.g., cowbird parasitism and predation) effects of grazing, which are not available under traditional management. Patch-burn management should be encouraged as a conservation strategy for grassland birds throughout the Great Plains. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Population and Individual Elephant Response to a Catastrophic Fire in Pilanesberg National Park
AN  - 1312438835
AB  - In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18% population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure. Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5% p.a., and at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts, follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during “hot-fire” conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e. removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for conservation areas.

T1  - Variation in soil seed bank species composition of a dry coniferous forest: spatial scale and sampling considerations
AN  - 226863581
AB  - In order to assess the effects of disturbance on soil seed bank spatial structure, variation in seed bank species composition was analyzed at two spatial scales in mature (undisturbed) and recently disturbed stands of Interior Douglas-fir forest in south-central British Columbia. Coarse-scale analysis among stands 10-100 km apart using Multi-Response Permutation Procedures showed that individual mature stands were mainly characterized by unique seed bank species compositions. Disturbance had an homogenizing effect on seed bank species composition at the coarse scale--there was less variability among stands following disturbance by both low and high severity fires, and by non-salvage logging. In contrast, finer scale analysis among sampling units c. 10 m apart showed that heterogeneity in seed bank species composition was greater on severely burned and logged sites, commensurate with greater levels of soil disturbance, than on lightly burned and undisturbed sites. Despite the high intensity of seed bank sampling (sixty 25 cm2 soil samples from each of 16 sites), species-area curves leveled off only when infrequent species were removed from the dataset. The number of seed bank samples required to account for the common species ranged from 84 on severely burned sites, to 196 on undisturbed sites; more than the 240 samples collected per disturbance class in this study would have been required to account for the remaining infrequent species. Overall, this study highlights the importance of sampling intensively within multiple stands to capture the variation in species composition inherent to these dry coniferous forest soil seed banks.

T1  - Effects of Season and Scale on Response of Elk and Mule Deer to Habitat Manipulation
AN  - 234257771
AB  - Manipulation of forest habitat via mechanical thinning or prescribed fire has become increasingly common across western North America. Nevertheless, empirical research on effects of those activities on wildlife is limited, although prescribed fire in particular often is assumed to benefit large herbivores. We evaluated effects of season and spatial scale on response of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to experimental habitat manipulation at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range in northeastern Oregon, USA. From 2001 to 2003, 26 densely stocked stands of true fir (Abies spp.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were thinned and burned whereas 27 similar stands were left untreated to serve as experimental controls. We used location data for elk and mule deer collected during spring (1 Apr-14 Jun) and summer (15 Jun-31 Aug) of 1999-2006 to compare use of treated and untreated stands and to model effects of environmental covariates on use of treated stands. In spring, elk selected burned stands and avoided control stands within the study area (second-order selection; large scale). Within home ranges (third-order selection; small scale), however, elk did not exhibit selection. In addition, selection of treatment stands by elk in spring was not strongly related to environmental covariates. Conversely, in summer elk selected control stands and either avoided or used burned stands proportional to their availability at the large scale; patterns of space use within home ranges were similar to those observed in spring. Use of treatment stands by elk in summer was related to topography, proximity to roads, stand size and shape, and presence of cattle, and a model of stand use explained 50% of variation in selection ratios. Patterns of stand use by mule deer did not change following habitat manipulation, and mule deer avoided or used all stand types proportional to their availability across seasons and scales. In systems similar to Starkey, manipulating forest habitat with prescribed fire might be of greater benefit to elk than mule deer where these species are sympatric, and thus maintaining a mixture of burned and unburned (late successional) habitat might provide better long-term foraging opportunities for both species than would burning a large proportion of a landscape.

T1  - Influence of Landscape Composition and Structure on Antler Size of White-Tailed Deer
AN  - 234209257
AB  - Cause for spatial variation in phenotypic quality of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations is of great interest to wildlife managers. Relating phenotypic variation of populations to large-scale land-use patterns may provide insight into why populations exhibit spatial variation and elucidate how management can influence population phenotype. We used an information-theoretic approach to relate average antler size of 203 deer populations to composition and structure of the habitat occupied by those populations. We used interspersion, edge, and diversity indices to represent habitat structure and percentage of area in vegetation types to represent habitat composition. Landscape composition was a better predictor of deer population antler size than was landscape structure. Percentages of the management unit in agriculture, pasture, and pine forest were variables commonly found in the region-specific set of best models. Model-averaged estimates of agriculture and pasture parameters were always positive and estimates of pine forest parameters were always negative, which suggests that land-use types that promote growth of early successional herbaceous plants will positively influence antler size and, most likely, body growth and reproduction of white-tailed deer populations. Conversely, our findings suggest landscapes dominated by pine forests did not provide optimal amounts of quality forages for white-tailed deer. Pine forest effects should be mitigated using a combination of increased harvest to lower deer density and silvicultural practices like thinning, prescribed burning, and selective herbicide applications that stimulate growth of high-quality forages beneath the forest canopy to improve deer phenotypic quality.

T1  - TIMING OF PRESCRIBED BURNS AFFECTS ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION OF ARTHROPODS IN THE TEXAS HILL COUNTRY
AN  - 885297749
AB  - Prior research has demonstrated that fire can be an important structuring force for plant communities in prairies and grasslands. However, investigations of land-management techniques, such as prescribed fire, often overlook responses of local fauna, particularly the arthropods. In this study, we examined a previously unappreciated, although potentially important, component of fire ecology by asking, does the timing of prescribed burns alter community structure of arthropods? At a site in the Texas Hill Country, we used sweep-net sampling to collected arthropods from experimental plots that had been treated with a summer-burn or winter-burn regime. Summer-burn plots supported >170% more individual arthropods than winter burns. Although overall diversity of arthropods did not significantly differ between treatments, there were significantly more carnivorous arthropods and marginally more herbivorous arthropods after fire in summer relative to fire in winter. Effects of timing were particularly strong for Cicadellidae (leaf hoppers) and Tetragnathidae (long-jawed spiders). Our results demonstrate that timing of prescribed fire can substantially alter composition of resident communities of arthropods. Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of examining composition of the community, in addition to diversity indices, when assessing response of arthropods to land-management techniques.

T1  - Associations Among Breeding Birds and Gambel Oak in Southwestern Ponderosa Pine Forests
AN  - 234179973
AB  - Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests with Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) are associated with higher bird abundance and diversity than are ponderosa pine forests lacking Gambel oak. Little is known, however, about specific structural characteristics of Gambel oak trees, clumps, and stands that may be important to birds in ponderosa pine-Gambel oak (hereafter pine-oak) forests. We examined associations among breeding birds and structural characteristics of Gambel oak at a scale similar in size to individual bird territories in pine-oak forests in northern Arizona and western New Mexico, USA. Avian species richness and occurrence of some bird species were associated with specific growth forms of Gambel oak. Estimated probability of Virginia's warblers (Vermivora virginiae), black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus), and red-faced warblers (Cardellina rubrifrons) occurring at points increased with increasing density of pole-sized Gambel oak 7-15 cm in diameter at breast height. We also found evidence that large Gambel oak trees (≥23 cm dbh) were associated with increased occurrence of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata) at points. Some avian associations with oak were influenced by characteristics of ponderosa pines. For example, bird species richness was positively associated with the abundance of large Gambel oak when density of large pine trees ≥23 cm in diameter at breast height was low. Because large oak trees are rare and their numbers are thought to be declining, efforts should be made to retain and promote growth of additional oaks in this size class. Forest management practices that maintain forest openings, such as prescribed burning, could promote growth of pole-sized Gambel oak, which appears important to some bird species in pine-oak forests.

T1  - Vegetation recovery after fuel management in Mediterranean shrublands
AN  - 1151977296
AB  - Question: What is the effect of fuel management practices in the recovery capacity of seeder-dominated shrublands?

              
Location:  Ulex parviflorus shrubland localities in Mediterranean regions of eastern Spain.

              
Methods: We applied prescribed burning and brush-chipping as fuel management techniques in three young and three mature shrublands, and evaluated the effects in the following four years.

              
Results: Canopy opening by the treatments allowed increasing species richness through the four years of secondary succession. The treatments produced a change in community structure and dominant species, from the woody seeder Ulex parviflorus to the resprouter grass Brachypodium retusum. Vegetation response was conditioned by both shrubland developmental stage and treatment applied. Burning resulted in more severe modification of the ecosystem, increasing bare soil cover. Four years after fuel management in different aged Mediterranean gorse shrublands, vegetation response followed a similar pattern with the exception of the young, brush-chipped shrublands. The treatments applied for controlling Ulex parviflorus were seen to be very effective, with the exception of brush-chipping in young shrublands.

              
Conclusions: Selective brush-chipping in middle-aged or mature gorse shrublands would combine a drastic reduction in fire hazard with ecosystem conservation and regeneration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Preburn Characteristics and Woodpecker Use of Burned Coniferous Forests
AN  - 234204195
AB  - Large wildfires are common in many western coniferous forests, and these fires can affect woodpecker reproduction and habitat use. Our objectives were to examine nesting densities, reproductive parameters, and species-specific habitat selection of woodpeckers in a recently burned region of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, between 2001 and 2004. Postfire nesting densities were greatest in areas dominated by high prefire canopy cover, and reproductive success averaged >70%. For some species of woodpeckers, factors such as diameter at breast height, burn severity, and distance to unburned patches were important for nest-site selection. Our data indicated that nesting densities of many woodpeckers in the Black Hills were lower than what has been recorded elsewhere following recent, large wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Management activities that simulate mixed-severity fire effects and retain higher numbers of large snags are likely to benefit cavity nesters in this region. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mountain Pine Beetle: From Lessons Learned to Community-based Solutions Conference Proceedings
AN  - 2124024701
AB  - Outbreaks of mountain pine beetle are evaluated as a generic disturbance agent, and comparisons are made with other forest disturbances such as wildfire, windthrow, and logging. A useful basis for comparison is the degree of disruption to the overstorey, understorey, and forest floor layers. Clear differences are observed in the impacts of bark beetles, fire, and windthrow, but there is overlap with various harvesting systems. Insects are selective in terms of the species or size of tree that is killed; this selectivity varies with stand composition, stand structure, and outbreak stage. The mountain pine beetle functions as part of larger natural disturbance regimes in western North America, which vary with climate and forest type. Outbreaks of many different insects occur throughout western Canada, with the relative role of fire and insects differing among ecoregions and over time. Beetle-killed stands may facilitate extreme fire behaviour and may be more susceptible to future burning. Large expanses of dead or removed trees also result in altered soil water balance and stream flows, disposing some sites to mass movement or flooding. All disturbances generate heterogeneity, with much of the value to biodiversity and ecosystem recovery depending on residual structure and biological legacies. The capacity for unassisted recovery and the value of each stand to timber supply, carbon balance, and habitat needs in a landscape context are relevant when considering salvage logging or forest rehabilitation. The future role of forest pests is expected to fluctuate in response to changes in climate and the altered composition and structure of western forests.

AB  - Restoration treatments have been widely advocated to address declining conditions in Pinus ponderosa forests throughout the western United States. However, few studies have examined treatment effects on individual plant species or whether responses differ for common species and uncommon species (those with low abundance in the community)--information that may be critical in managing for long-term biodiversity. We investigated understory species responses to restoration treatments in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests using a randomized block experimental design with three blocks and four treatments (control, burn-only, thin-only, and thin-burn). Understory vegetation was sampled before treatment and for three consecutive years after treatment. We used richness and an index of uniqueness to compare responses of common and uncommon native understory species among treatments, and indicator species analysis to identify individual species that responded to each treatment. Treatments that included thinning had significantly more unique species assemblages than the control. The thin-only treatment increased common native species richness, whereas all active treatments significantly increased uncommon native species richness over the control, especially the thin-burn. Generally, life-forms did not explain the responses of individual species, though in the final sampling year several graminoids were exclusively indicative of treatments that included thinning. Very few species had reduced abundance in the thinning and burning treatments by the final sample year, whereas many uncommon and short-lived species benefited from active treatments, especially the combined thin-burn treatment. Active restoration treatments in these forests may foster plant diversity by minimally impacting common species while significantly benefiting disturbance-dependent native species.

T1  - Short-Term Response of Land Birds to Ponderosa Pine Restoration
AN  - 213843803
AB  - We monitored the short-term (>3 years) response of land birds to forest restoration treatments in Ponderosa pine forests located on the east slope of the North Cascade Range. Restoration treatments were designed to create stand structure and composition similar to pre-settlement forests, which were influenced by a frequent fire regime. Overall, avian community composition was changed as a result of the treatments. Cassin's Finch, Chipping Sparrow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler were found at higher densities in treated stands, whereas Mountain Chickadee, Western Tanager, and Red-breasted Nuthatch had higher densities in untreated stands. White-headed Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were only detected in the treated stands. Brown-headed Cowbird showed no response to treatments. We detected changes in the density of four of five foraging guilds in response to restoration treatments. Tree seedeaters, low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore density was lower in treated than in untreated stands. Overall avian density, density of neotropical migrants, and density of some focal species were higher in treated stands. Monitoring should be continued to understand the longer-term (5-10 year) responses of land birds and to guide future forest restoration efforts.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Burning of Logged Sites to Protect Beetles in Managed Boreal Forests
AN  - 201359158
AB  - Natural disturbance-based management and conservation strategies are needed to protect forest biodiversity. Boreal forests of northern Europe are typically clearcut and otherwise intensively managed for timber production. As a result, natural disturbances such as forest fires have became rare and the volume of dead wood has decreased. These changes have had a profound negative effect on species that depend on dead wood (saproxylic). Therefore, it is important to determine whether modifications of forest management methods can enhance the survival of these species. In our study area in southern Finland, we determined whether burning of logged sites and leaving trees (i.e., retention trees) on the sites benefited saproxylic, rare, and red-listed beetle species and how long the burned sites remained suitable habitat for these species. We surveyed the beetle fauna at 40 sites logged 1-16 years previously, 20 of which were burned after logging. The abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles were positively affected by burning, but the effect depended on the retention of trees in the otherwise clearcut stands. The difference between burned and unburned sites increased with the number of retention trees, and the effect of burning was not significant when there were fewer than approximately 15 retention trees/ha. Most important, the species groups that were unlikely to persist in ordinarily managed forests (rare saproxylic and red-listed beetles), benefited strongly from burning and tree retention. The species richness of saproxylic beetles decreased with time since logging at both burned and at unburned sites. We conclude that burning of logged sites and leaving an adequate number of retention trees may be useful in the conservation of disturbance-adapted species and can be used to improve the environmental quality of the matrix surrounding protected areas. Unfortunately, sites remained high-quality habitat for only a short time; thus, a continuum of burned areas must be ensured. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Breeding Birds in Riparian and Upland Dry Forests of the Cascade Range
AN  - 234260806
AB  - We quantified breeding bird abundance, diversity, and indicator species in riparian and upland dry forests along 6 third- to fourth-order streams on the east slope of the Cascade Range, Washington, USA. Upland dry forest on southerly aspects was dominated by open ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plant associations. Upland mesic forest on northerly aspects was dominated by closed-canopy Douglas-fir or dry grand fir (Abies grandis) plant associations. Riparian overstory vegetation was dominated by black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) plant associations with a prominent hardwood tree and shrub component. We quantified bird assemblages, diversity, and abundance from parallel point transects on riparian and adjacent dry and mesic upslope forests. We detected 80 bird species from >12,000 point-transect observations during 1998-1999. Eighteen species accounted for 75% of all detections. Species richness and evenness were similar in all 3 forest types, with approximately 35 species and high evenness (0.85) in each forest type. Bird species assemblages differed among dry, mesic, and riparian forest types, with the greatest differences between riparian and both dry and mesic upland forests. Riparian forest had the greatest number (9) of strong characteristic, or indictor, species among the 3 forest types. Upland mesic forest was characterized by 7 indicator species. Upland dry forest had 4 indicator species. Our results indicate that current standards and guidelines for riparian buffers zones would allow for avian refuge and corridor functions along these streams. Forest managers could use our indicator species to predict and monitor shifts in upland forest species composition from thinning and prescribed burning practices that are used to reduce fuels in uplands and to reduce continuity of fire effects between riparian and upland zones.

T1  - Habitat-Suitability Models for Cavity-Nesting Birds in a Postfire Landscape
AN  - 234182130
AB  - Models of habitat suitability in postfire landscapes are needed by land managers to make timely decisions regarding postfire timber harvest and other management activities. Many species of cavity-nesting birds are dependent on postfire landscapes for breeding and other aspects of their life history and are responsive to postfire management activities (e.g., timber harvest). In addition, several cavity nesters are designated as species at risk. We compare the ability of 2 types of models to distinguish between nest and non-nest locations of 6 cavity-nesting bird species (Lewis's woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus], hairy woodpecker [P. villosus], northern flicker [Colaptes auratus], western bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and mountain bluebird [S. currucoides]) in the early postfire years for a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in Idaho, USA. The 2 model sets consisted of 1) models based on readily available remotely sensed data and 2) models containing field-collected data in addition to remotely sensed data (combination models). We evaluated models of nesting habitat by quantifying the model's ability to correctly identify nest and non-nest locations and by determining the percentage of correctly identified nest locations. Additionally, we developed relative habitat-suitability maps for nesting habitat of black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers from the best models. For all species except Lewis's woodpeckers, model performance improved with the addition of field-collected data. Models containing remotely sensed data adequately distinguished between nest and non-nest locations for black-backed woodpecker and Lewis's woodpecker only, whereas models containing both field-collected and remotely sensed data were adequate for all 6 species. Improvements in the availability of more accurate remote sensing technology would likely lead to improvements in the ability of the models to predict nesting locations. External validation with data from other wildfires is necessary to confirm the general applicability of our habitat-suitability models to other forests. Land managers responsible for maintaining habitat for cavity-nesting birds in postfire landscapes can use these models to identify potential nesting areas for these species and select areas in burned forests where postfire salvage logging is most likely to have minimal impacts on cavity-nesting bird habitats.

T1  - Mimicking natural disturbances of boreal forests: the effects of controlled burning and creating dead wood on beetle diversity
AN  - 365397281
AB  - The young successional stages of boreal forests are an important habitat for many saproxylic species. These habitats are formed by disturbances such as forest fires and they are characterized by large volumes of dead wood and sun-exposed conditions. Today, young successional stages of natural origin are very rare in Fennoscandia and there is need for restoration. We constructed a large-scale field experiment in which we studied the effects of two restoration practices on beetle diversity: controlled burning and partial harvesting with creating different volumes of dead wood. We sampled beetles with flight-intercept traps recording a total of 56,031 individuals and 755 species. The species richness and abundance of both saproxylic and non-saproxylic beetles were increased by burning and harvesting but the volume of dead wood created on harvested sites had no short-term effect on species richness or abundance. Rare species, especially saproxylic ones, preferred burned sites and a similar trend was observed among red-listed and pyrophilous species. Burning and harvesting also resulted in different species assemblages and there were some additional differences according to the volume of dead wood. We conclude that fire can be successfully used in restoration of managed boreal forests to increase species diversity and to facilitate the recovery of declined species. However, long-term monitoring is needed to clarify the effects of the restoration practices, in particular those of creating dead wood without using fire.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Seasonal and Inter-Annual Variations in Methyl Mercury Concentrations in Zooplankton from Boreal Lakes Impacted by Deforestation or Natural Forest Fires
AN  - 375497032; 17171280
AB  - We compared the effects of natural and anthropogenic watershed disturbances on methyl mercury (MeHg) concentration in bulk zooplankton from boreal Shield lakes. MeHg in zooplankton was monitored for three years in nine lakes impacted by deforestation, in nine lakes impacted by wildfire, and in twenty lakes with undisturbed catchments. Lakes were sampled during spring, mid- and late summer. MeHg in zooplankton showed a seasonal trend: concentrations were the lowest in spring, then peaked in mid-summer and decreased in late summer. Over the three study years, MeHg concentrations observed in mid-summer in zooplankton from forest harvested lakes were significantly higher than in reference and fire-impacted lakes, whereas differences between these two groups of lakes were not significant. The pattern of distribution of MeHg in zooplankton during the different seasons paralleled that of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is known as a vector of Hg from watershed soils to lake water. Besides DOC, MeHg in zooplankton also showed a positive significant correlation with epilimnetic temperature and sulfate concentrations. An inter-annual decreasing trend in MeHg was observed in zooplankton from reference and fire-impacted lakes. In forest harvested lakes, however, MeHg concentrations remained higher and nearly constant over three years following the impact. Overall these results indicate that the MeHg pulse observed in zooplankton following deforestation by harvesting is relatively long-lived, and may have repercussions to the accumulation of MeHg along the food chain. Therefore, potential effects of deforestation on the Hg contamination of fish should be taken into account in forest management practices.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - SEED PREFERENCES OF WINTERING HENSLOW'S SPARROWS
AN  - 211253085
AB  - The Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), a species of conservation concern, winters primarily in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems in the southeastern US. These pine savannas have been reduced to 5% of their former range, with remaining patches requiring active management with fire to maintain characteristic structure and plant diversity. Wintering Henslow's Sparrow abundance tracks growing- season fires; bird abundance peaks in the winter following burning, then declines in subsequent winters. Fire also determines dominant plant species, suggesting that Henslow's Sparrows may respond to abundance of preferred seeds. To determine diet preferences of Henslow's Sparrows, we tested seeds from eight species of native plants from southeastern Louisiana pine savannas, including species common in the first winter after burning ('fire grasses') and species that increase in abundance in the second and subsequent winters after burning. Seed consumption by individual birds differed considerably, suggesting that Henslow's Sparrows forage on a variety of resources in the highly diverse savannas. Henslow's Sparrows preferred fire grasses, especially Muhlenbergia expansa (cutover muhly). They also preferred Dichanthelium angustifolium (needleleaf rosette grass), a species more common in the second year after burning, but consumed relatively little of the sedges Rhynchospora plumosa (plumed beaksedge) and R. gracilenta (slender beaksedge), species common in the second winter after fire. Birds consumed almost none of the ubiquitous grass Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem). These results suggest that preferred seeds may include those that are most common in the first winter after burning, but that some suitable seeds are available for at least another winter.

T1  - ORIGINAL ARTICLE: EFFECTS OF FIRES ON BUTTERFLY ASSEMBLAGES IN LOWLAND DIPTEROCARP FOREST IN EAST KALIMANTAN
AN  - 219947208
AB  - The post-fire butterfly fauna in lowland dipterocarp forest of the Bukit Soeharto Education Forest (BSEF), East Kalimantan, Indonesia, was assessed during the period November 1998-April 2000 by means of consecutive Malaise trap samples, with supplementary field observations for March-April 1999. A total of 514 butterflies belonging to 61 species and representing six families were caught in the traps. Melanitis leda  (Nymphalidae: Satyrinae), Charaxes bernardus  (Nymphalidae: Charaxinae), and Danaus genutia  (Nymphalidae: Danainae) were the species most frequently caught (60, 52 and 47 individuals, respectively), representing 31% of the total. These three species are generalists and "disturbance indicators" for tropical rainforest, being characteristic of disturbed or secondary forests, being distributed widely, and having larvae that feed on a wide range of host plants. In contrast, other species, such as Trogonoptera brookiana  and Troides amphrysus , were recorded before the fires but were not recorded again afterwards. The pre- and post-fire butterfly fauna of East Kalimantan were compared on the basis of butterfly specimens deposited in the Tropical Rain Forest Research Center that were collected in and around the Bukit Soeharto Education Forest before the fires (1988-1995). On the basis of the post-fire survey, based on Malaise trap samples and field observations, only 43% of the butterfly species (not including Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae) were confirmed to have persisted. The data suggest that refugia that are not affected by fire are necessary for the conservation of specialist butterflies, as well as many other forms of wildlife. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - HABITAT RELATIONSHIPS OF BIRDS OVERWINTERING IN A MANAGED COASTAL PRAIRIE: A JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AN  - 198743476
AB  - Grassland birds are considered to be rapidly declining in North America. Management approaches for grassland birds frequently rely on prescribed burning to maintain habitat in suitable condition. We evaluated the relationships among years since burn, vegetation structure, and overwintering grassland bird abundance in coastal prairie. Le Conte's Sparrows (Ammodramus leconteii) were most common in areas that had: (1) been burned within the previous 2 years, (2) medium density herbaceous vegetation, and (3) sparse shrub densities. Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) were associated with areas: (1) burned within 1 year, (2) with sparse herbaceous vegetation, and (3) with sparse shrub densities. Sedge Wrens (Cistothorus platensis) were most common in areas that had: (1) burned greater than 2 years prior and (2) dense herbaceous vegetation. Swamp Sparrows (Melospiza georgiana): (1) were most common in areas of dense shrubs, (2) not related to time since burnings, and (3) demonstrated no relationship to herbaceous vegetation densities. The relationships to fire histories for all four bird species could be explained by the associated vegetation characteristics indicating the need for a mosaic of burn rotations and modest levels of woody vegetation.

T1  - Habitat Selection of Female Turkeys in a Managed Pine Landscape in Mississippi
AN  - 234262681
AB  - Intensive pine (Pinus spp.) management is a dominant form of forest management in the southeastern United States. Previous research has shown that managed pine forests provide suitable habitat for eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), but little research has examined seasonal habitat selection for female wild turkeys from a landscape perspective, particularly within managed pine landscapes. Therefore, we used a long-term (1986-1993) data set to describe seasonal habitat selection by female wild turkeys, using an information-theoretic approach from a landscape perspective, on an intensively managed pine landscape. Habitat use patterns during preincubation and autumn-winter were indicative of female wild turkeys moving between a bottomland hardwood-agricultural field complex during autumn-winter and upland managed pine stands during the remainder of the year. During spring and summer, female wild turkeys used landscapes primarily composed of intensively managed pine, including thinned and burned stands and roadsides. Our results confirm results of short-term, stand-based habitat analyses on our study area. We recommend variable fire return intervals of 3 to 7 years to improve habitat conditions for wild turkeys within intensively managed pine forests. Further research is needed to examine management actions, such as thinning, prescribed fire, and herbicide use, within the context of wild turkey use of intensively managed pine landscapes.

T1  - Effects of prescribed burning on plant available nutrients in dry heathland ecosystems
AN  - 822561713
AB  - Heathland management is an important tool with which to modify ecosystem impacts caused by atmospheric nutrient deposition. Since changes in nutrient availability as a result of management measures affect the outcomes of heathland succession and species competition, studies on this issue are important from both a nature conservation and management point of view. This study reports the effects of prescribed burning on nutrient availability in dry heathland soils and the nutrient content of the two competing heathland species Calluna vulgaris and Deschampsia flexuosa, with particular reference to N and P. We hypothesise that winter prescribed burning leads to additional N availability, which enhances the importance of P in the context of nutrient limitation in heathland ecosystems. In the nature reserve "Lueneburg Heath" (NW Germany) we examined the availability of nutrients in the humus horizons and in the leachate as well as the relevant C:element ratios in Calluna and Deschampsia before and after a burning experiment. Our results show that prescribed burning resulted in drastically increased NH                   ^sub 4^                   ^sup +^                  availability in the O-horizon. We observed only short-term effects (for NO                   ^sub 3^                   ^sup -^                 , PO                   ^sub 4^                   ^sup 3-^                 , Mg) and insignificant effects on the availability of other nutrients (K, Ca). As a consequence of an increased nutrient availability in the humus horizons and a limited nutrient uptake by plants after burning, leaching increased significantly for N, Ca, K, and Mg after burning treatment. No significant changes were found in the foliar C:N ratios for either species after prescribed burning, although Deschampsia showed an increased deficiency for all the other nutrients, particularly for P, as expressed by increased foliar C:P and N:P ratios. By contrast, the nutrient content of Calluna did not change significantly, suggesting that prescribed burning favours the competitive capacity of Calluna as against Deschampsia. We assume that water shortage as a result of changes in the microclimate was mainly responsible for the deterioration of the nutrient content of Deschampsia. This gives Calluna a competitive advantage, enabling it to out-compete Deschampsia on burned heathlands, with respect to the key factor P-limitation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gopher Tortoise Response to Habitat Management by Prescribed Burning
AN  - 234115061
AB  - As quality of forested habitat declines from altered fire regimes, gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) often move into ruderal areas to the detriment of the animal and land manager. We evaluated effects of a dormant-and-growing-season prescribed fire on habitat and gopher tortoise use of degraded longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests surrounding military training areas. We burned 4 of 8 sites in winter 2001-2002 and again in April 2003. Changes in vegetation measured during 2001-2004 indicated that burn treatments did not increase herbaceous vegetation. Similarly, movement patterns, burrow usage, and home range of tortoises radiotracked from 2002-2004 did not differ between treatments. Woody cover initially was reduced in the forests postburn, and we found more new burrows in burned forest sites. Once shrub cover was reduced, tortoises started using forested habitat that had become overgrown. However, shrub reduction may be temporary, as woody stem densities increased postburn. Thus, the one-time use of fire to manage tortoise habitat may not rapidly restore the open canopy, sparse woody midstory, and abundant herbaceous vegetation that this species requires. Repeated prescribed fires or additional management techniques may be needed for complete restoration. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Avian Nest Box Selection and Nest Success in Burned and Unburned Southwestern Riparian Forest
AN  - 234112425
AB  - Riparian forest communities in the southwestern United States were historically structured by a disturbance regime of annual flooding. In recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (<7 yr after fire) had a much different vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (>7 yr after fire) wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well. Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots, while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness, and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in riparian zones. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Responses of plant and bird communities to prescribed burning in tallgrass prairies
AN  - 222293894
AB  - Issue Title: Themed issue: Vertebrate Conservation and Biodiversity              Historic losses and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie habitat to agriculture and urban development have led to declines in diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Prescribed burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995 to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites. Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain area-sensitive species might require larger sites able to support larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and greater opportunity for niche separation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cattle-rangeland management practices and perceptions of pastoralists towards rangeland degradation in the Borana zone of southern Ethiopia
AN  - 838989195; 3349664
AB  - A survey was conducted in the Borana pastoral areas of southern Ethiopia to assess current livestock production systems, rangeland management practices and the perceptions of the pastoralists towards rangeland degradation. This information is considered vital to future pastoral development planning and interventions. Data were collected from a total of 20 villages that were identified from 5 peasant associations, namely Did Yabello, Moyatte, Did Harra, Dubuluk and Melbana. The average household size in the study area was 7.23. The majority of the pastoralists relied on both livestock and crop farming. The average livestock holding per household was 14 cattle, 10 goats, 6 sheep and 2 camels. Livestock holdings, with the exception of camels, has shown a declining trend over time. The two most important traditional rangeland management strategies adopted by the pastoralists included burning and mobility, but since 1974/75 burning has no longer been practised. With regard to mobility, the livestock herding falls in two categories, namely: home based and satellite herding. The former involves the herding of milking cows, calves and immature animals (2 years) further away from the encampments. Based on the pastoralists' perceptions, the major constraints on livestock production in descending order, were recurrent drought, feed and water scarcity, animal diseases, predators and communal land ownership. All the respondents considered the condition of the rangelands to have declined dramatically over time. In the past most development policies were based on equilibrium theories that opposed the communal use of the rangelands and traditional range management practices. The way in which the pastoral system affects the rangeland ecosystem functioning is contentious to this theory and the 'tragedy of the commons'. There was also a perceived problem of bush encroachment and the ban on traditional burning practices and recurrent droughts were seen as aggravating factors to this invasion process. The increasing practice of crop cultivation on the rangelands was identified as a serious threat to future livestock production and traditional resource management practices. Suggestions for possible interventions to improve the productivity and sustainable use of these rangelands are made. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T1  - EFFECT OF PRIOR DISTURBANCES ON THE EXTENT AND SEVERITY OF WILDFIRE IN COLORADO SUBALPINE FORESTS
AN  - 219001143
AB  - Disturbances are important in creating spatial heterogeneity of vegetation patterns that in turn may affect the spread and severity of subsequent disturbances. Between 1997 and 2002 extensive areas of subalpine forests in northwestern Colorado were affected by a blowdown of trees, bark beetle outbreaks, and salvage logging. Some of these stands were also affected by severe fires in the late 19th century. During a severe drought in 2002, fires affected extensive areas of these subalpine forests. We evaluated and modeled the extent and severity of the 2002 fires in relation to these disturbances that occurred over the five years prior to the fires and in relation to late 19th century stand- replacing fires. Occurrence of disturbances prior to 2002 was reconstructed using a combination of tree-ring methods, aerial photograph interpretation, field surveys, and geographic information systems (GIS). The extent and severity of the 2002 fires were based on the normalized difference burn ratio (NDBR) derived from satellite imagery. GIS and classification trees were used to analyze the effects of prefire conditions on the 2002 fires. Previous disturbance history had a significant influence on the severity of the 2002 fires. Stands that were severely blown down (>66% trees down) in 1997 burned more severely than other stands, and young (120 year old) postflre stands burned less severely than older stands. In contrast, prefire disturbances were poor predictors of fire extent, except that young (120 years old) postflre stands were less extensively burned than older stands. Salvage logging and bark beetle outbreaks that followed the 1997 blowdown (within the blowdown as well as in adjacent forest that was not blown down) did not appear to affect fire extent or severity. Conclusions regarding the influence of the beetle outbreaks on fire extent and severity are limited, however, by spatial and temporal limitations associated with aerial detection surveys of beetle activity. Thus, fire extent in these forests is largely independent of prefire disturbance history and vegetation conditions. In contrast, fire severity, even during extreme fire weather and in conjunction with a multiyear drought, is influenced by prefire stand conditions, including the history of previous disturbances.

T1  - Management Implications of Cover Selection Data: Northern Bobwhite Example
AN  - 234184948
AB  - We derived a method of estimating the direction and magnitude of cover changes for potentially maximizing wildlife abundance on an area. We illustrate the method with data on cover selection by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) collected in the Texas Panhandle from 2000 to 2003. We used radiotelemetry to determine use of cover associations, Geographic Information System analysis to determine their availability, and logic related to use-availability analysis to collapse 95% kernel home ranges to usable space. Bobwhites selected mixed-shrub cover consisting of sand plum (Prunus angustifolia) and fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), and they avoided or neutrally used 8 other cover associations. However, grass upland and sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) associations occurred in ≥86% of home ranges (n = 96 bobwhites with ≥30 radiolocations). Usable space averaged 54.2% ± 1.72 SE of kernel home ranges. The data indicated that adding about 226 ha of mixed-shrub cover or a structural homologue while simultaneously reducing the quantity of most other cover associations would maximize bobwhite abundance. An area with 30-60% mixed-shrub cover, with the balance in grass upland and sand sagebrush, and with cover dispersed such that no point was >30 m from mixed-shrub cover was hypothetically optimal for bobwhites in our region. Within certain constraints (e.g., financial, social, edaphic), managers can apply this method by manipulating cover types through relevant management practices (e.g., planting, prescribed burning, mechanical removal of vegetation). This method, with minor modification, could also be used to decrease usable space on an area, and thus decrease wildlife densities, should that be the manager's objective. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - NEST DENSITIES OF CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS IN RELATION TO POSTFIRE SALVAGE LOGGING AND TIME SINCE WILDFIRE
AN  - 211249432
AB  - We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel [Falco sparverius], Lewis's Woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and Mountain Bluebird [S. currucoides]) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus], Black-backed Woodpecker [P. arcticus], and Northern Flicker [Colaptes auratus]), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire.

T1  - Context, Beliefs, and Attitudes toward Wildland Fire Management: An Examination of Residents of the Wildland-Urban Interface
AN  - 61702693; 200817571
AB  - There are a number of benefits from wildland fire such as forest reproduction, habitat improvement, and reduction of threats from insects and diseases. However, along with these benefits are threats to human life, property and air quality. The trade-off between wildfire benefits and costs causes differences in public beliefs about fire management. We surveyed residents of the wildland-urban interface to determine the effects of contextual factors such as location of the forest, its primary use, wildfire history, and current fire conditions on acceptability of prescribed burning, mechanical thinning, and doing nothing. The current condition of the forest was the most important factor influencing support/opposition of management strategies for both individualists and non-individualists. The importance of forest proximity, wildfire history, and forest use depended on the management strategy under consideration and group. Results will help inform land managers in making fire management prescriptions and communicating with the public about those decisions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Integration of Ecological Risk Assessment and Structured Decision Making into Watershed Management
AN  - 210706966
AB  - Watershed management processes continue to call for more science and improved decision making that take into account the full range of stakeholder perspectives. Increasingly, the core principles of ecological risk assessment (i.e., the development and use of assessment endpoints and conceptual models, conducting exposure and effects analysis) are being incorporated and adapted in innovative ways to meet the call for more science. Similarly, innovative approaches to adapting decision analysis tools and methods for incorporating stakeholder concerns in complex natural resource management decisions are being increasingly applied. Here, we present an example of the integration of ecological risk assessment with decision analysis in the development of a watershed management plan for the Greater Vancouver Water District in British Columbia, Canada. Assessment endpoints were developed, ecological inventory data were collected, and watershed models were developed to characterize the existing and future condition of 3 watersheds in terms of the potential risks to water quality. Stressors to water quality include sedimentation processes (landslides, streambank erosion) and forest disturbance (wildfire, major insect or disease outbreak). Three landscape-level risk management alternatives were developed to reflect different degrees of management intervention. Each alternative was evaluated under different scenarios and analyzed by explicitly examining value-based trade-offs among water quality, environmental, financial, and social endpoints. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the integration of ecological risk assessment and decision analysis approaches can support decision makers in watershed management.

T1  - Landscape-Scale Forest Habitat Relationships to Tassel-Eared Squirrel Populations: Implications for Ponderosa Pine Forest Restoration
AN  - 213842275
AB  - Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forest ecosystem restoration is a growing emphasis in the southwestern United States to address over 120 years of forest structure change, decreased forest health, and increased potential for disease and wildfire. Restoration treatments replicating pre-settlement conditions may reduce tree density by 98%, are detrimental to canopy-dependent wildlife such as tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti), particularly at the patch scale, and are of concern when applied at the landscape scale. We examined S. aberti population dynamics in north-central Arizona, U.S.A., from 1999 to 2002 at nine 280-ha sites oriented along a landscape gradient of varying proportions (4.6-99.2%) of unlogged, high-quality (HQ) habitats within a matrix of intensively thinned low-quality habitat. Our objectives were to estimate S. aberti density, juvenile recruitment, and survival across this gradient; quantify patch- and landscape-scale habitat relationships to populations; evaluate possible habitat thresholds in squirrel population response; and develop forest management recommendations. In regression models, both patch-scale and landscape-scale parameters influenced squirrel populations. At the patch scale, number of interlocking canopy trees was added most frequently, whereas the proportion of HQ habitat was the landscape-scale variable added in five of seven models. Recruitment and survival at dense, HQ plots were inversely related to number of small, sapling-sized trees. Nonlinear thresholds in density and recruitment occurred when the proportion of HQ habitat at study sites was between 24 and 42%. Our study points to the importance of maintaining HQ habitat in mesoreserves on the landscape at or above this threshold range, as well as pursing a mix of forest management prescriptions in the matrix surrounding mesoreserves to achieve wildlife, forest restoration, and fire risk reduction objectives.

T1  - Landscape-Scale Forest Habitat Relationships to Tassel-Eared Squirrel Populations: Implications for Ponderosa Pine Forest Restoration: [1]
AN  - 213841966
AB  - Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forest ecosystem restoration is a growing emphasis in the southwestern United States to address over 120 years of forest structure change, decreased forest health, and increased potential for disease and wildfire. Restoration treatments replicating pre-settlement conditions may reduce tree density by 98%, are detrimental to canopy-dependent wildlife such as tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti), particularly at the patch scale, and are of concern when applied at the landscape scale. We examined S. aberti population dynamics in north-central Arizona, U.S.A., from 1999 to 2002 at nine 280-ha sites oriented along a landscape gradient of varying proportions (4.6-99.2%) of unlogged, high-quality (HQ) habitats within a matrix of intensively thinned low-quality habitat. Our objectives were to estimate S. aberti density, juvenile recruitment, and survival across this gradient; quantify patch- and landscape-scale habitat relationships to populations; evaluate possible habitat thresholds in squirrel population response; and develop forest management recommendations. In regression models, both patch-scale and landscape-scale parameters influenced squirrel populations. At the patch scale, number of interlocking canopy trees was added most frequently, whereas the proportion of HQ habitat was the landscape-scale variable added in five of seven models. Recruitment and survival at dense, HQ plots were inversely related to number of small, sapling-sized trees. Nonlinear thresholds in density and recruitment occurred when the proportion of HQ habitat at study sites was between 24 and 42%. Our study points to the importance of maintaining HQ habitat in mesoreserves on the landscape at or above this threshold range, as well as pursing a mix of forest management prescriptions in the matrix surrounding mesoreserves to achieve wildlife, forest restoration, and fire risk reduction objectives.

T1  - Fire and Green-Tree Retention in Conservation of Red-Listed and Rare Deadwood-Dependent Beetles in Finnish Boreal Forests
AN  - 201334862
AB  - Habitat loss, fragmentation, and declining habitat quality have created an extinction debt in boreal forests, which could be partly reversed by deliberately improving the habitat quality in managed areas outside reserves. We studied the effects of green-tree retention and controlled burning on red-listed and rare, deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles in a large-scale field experiment in eastern Finland. Our factorial study design included 24 sites dominated by Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) and with three levels of green-tree retention (0, 10, and 50 m3/ha) and uncut controls. Twelve of the 24 sites were burned in 2001. We sampled beetles with 10 flight-intercept traps on each site during the years 2000-2002 (i.e., 1 pretreatment and 2 post-treatment years). A total sample of 153,449 individuals representing 1,160 beetle species yielded 2,107 specimens of 84 red-listed or rare saproxylic species. The richness of these species was higher on the burned than on the unburned sites, and higher levels of green-tree retention promoted species richness, but there were clear differences between the years. The richness of red-listed and rare saproxylic species increased in the first post-treatment year, evidently due to the treatments, continued to increase on the burned sites in the second post-treatment year, but decreased on the unburned sites. Our results showed that the living conditions of many red-listed and rare saproxylic species could be improved significantly with rather simple alterations to forest management methods. Controlled burning with high levels of green-tree retention creates resources for many saproxylic species, but increasing the levels of green-tree retention in unburned areas can also be beneficial.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Boom means bust: interactions between the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), rainfall and the processes threatening mammal species in arid Australia
AN  - 751619013
AB  - We collated an environmental history for a 8580 km^sup 2^ study area in the Simpson Desert, Australia. Quantitative and qualitative data on climate, land-use, fire history and ecosystem dynamics were used to construct a chronology of processes threatening terrestrial mammal species. Over the last 150 years there has been the transition in land tenure from a hunter-gatherer economy to pastoralism, the loss of 11 mammal species, the cessation of small scale burning by Aboriginal people and the introduction of the fox and cat. Annual rainfall was highly variable and was influenced by the phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Irruptions of rodents, marked increases in the populations of native and introduced predators and extensive wildfires were associated with the La Niña phase of ENSO and occurred when rain-year (July-June) rainfall approached or exceeded the 90th percentile of the historical rainfall distribution. Large rainfall events in arid Australia have been viewed traditionally as the 'boom' times that benefit wildlife and pastoral production. However, because of hyper-predation and the risk of wildfire, we show that the years including and immediately following flooding rains should be identified as critical, or 'bust' periods for wildlife and conservation management. ENSO related climatic forecasts appear to be useful cues which can be incorporated into fire and predator management strategies in arid Australia. Studies such as this, which utilise a broad range of data types across extensive areas, can identify the timing and potential of threatening process not possible using contemporary studies alone.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Hairy Woodpecker Winter Ecology in Ponderosa Pine Forests Representing Different Ages Since Wildfire
AN  - 234216248
AB  - We investigated how changes in vegetation structure and prey resources following wildfire affected the winter ecology of hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a bum, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.

T1  - Plants and Breeding Bird Response on a Managed Conservation Reserve Program Grassland in Maryland
AN  - 230191196
AB  - Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US$1.76 billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CRP grasslands at Chino Farms in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985 grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the last 5 years were 57% for adult males, 41% for adult females, and 12% for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species. Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation physical structure rather than species composition.

T1  - THE EFFECTS OF POSTFIRE SALVAGE LOGGING ON CAVITY-NESTING BIRDS
AN  - 211303424
AB  - We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage- logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

T1  - EARLY HOLOCENE OPENLANDS IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND
AN  - 219011470
AB  - The pre-historical vegetation structure in temperate forest regions is much debated among European and North American ecologists and conservationists. Frans Vera's recent hypothesis that large mammals created mosaics of forest and openland vegetation in both regions throughout the Holocene has been particularly controversial and has provoked new approaches to conservation management. Thirty years earlier, American paleoecologists Herb Wright and Margaret Davis debated whether abundant ragweed pollen at Rogers Lake, Connecticut at 9500 yr BP signified local forest openings or long-distance transport of pollen from Midwestern prairies. Using new pollen records from Harvard Forest and the North American Pollen Database, we address this question and offer insights to the openland discussion. Ragweed and other forbs exceed 3.5% at five sites in a restricted area of southern New England between 10 100 and 7700 yr BP. Strong evidence suggests this pollen originated from the landscapes surrounding these sites (supporting Davis), as ragweed pollen percentages do not increase with longitude from New England to the Midwest. Ragweed pollen percentages are also unrelated to basin size and therefore unrelated to the proportion of extraregional pollen in New England. High forbs values were associated with increases in oak, decreases in white pine, and relatively high charcoal values. Modern pollen records with similar forb and tree percentages occur along the Prairie Peninsula region of the Upper Midwest. However, the closest analogue to the southern New England early Holocene assemblages comes from Massachusetts' Walden Pond in the early 18th century. These results and the affiliation of ragweed for open, disturbed habitats suggest that oak-pine forests with large openings persisted for over 2000 years due to dry conditions and perhaps increased fire frequency. This conclusion is corroborated by independent lake level and climate reconstructions. Because these early Holocene openlands have no detectable analogue in New England for the past 7000 years before European settlement, we suggest that all important openlands today are almost exclusively a legacy of Colonial agriculture and should be managed accordingly. Nonetheless, our results may have implications for forest dynamics accompanying projected climate change to more arid conditions in New England over the next century. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effect of fire on benthic algal assemblage structure and recolonization in intermittent streams
AN  - 199213807
AB  - Dry biofilm on rocks and other substrata forms an important drought refuge for benthic algae in intermittent streams following the cessation of flow. This dry biofilm is potentially susceptible to disturbance from bushfires, including direct burning and/or scorching and damage from radiant heat, particularly when streams are dry. Therefore, damage to dry biofilms by fire has the potential to influence algal recolonization and assemblage structure in intermittent streams following commencement of flow. The influence of fire on benthic algal assemblages and recolonization was examined in intermittent streams of the Grampians National Park, Victoria, Australia, using a field survey and manipulative field experiment. The field survey compared assemblages in two intermittent streams within a recently burnt area (within 5 months of the fire) with two intermittent streams within an unburnt area. The two burnt streams were still flowing during the fire so most biofilms were not likely to be directly exposed to flames. Considerable site-to-site and stream-to-stream variation was detected during the field survey, which may have obscured potential differences attributable to indirect effects of the fire. The manipulative field experiment occurred in two intermittent streams and consisted of five treatments chosen to replicate various characteristics of bushfires that may influence dry biofilms: dry biofilm exposed directly to fire; dry biofilm exposed to radiant heat; dry biofilm exposed to ash; and two procedural controls. After exposure to the different treatments, rocks were replaced in the streams and algae were sampled 7 days after flow commenced. Differences occurred across treatments, but treatment differences were inconsistent across the two streams. For example, direct exposure to fire reduced the abundance of recolonizing algae and altered assemblage structure in both streams, while radiant heat had an effect on assemblage structure in one stream only. The manipulative field experiment is likely to have represented the intensity of a small bushfire only. Nonetheless, significant differences across treatments were detected, so these experimental results suggest that fire can damage dry biofilms, and hence, influence algal recolonization and assemblage structure in intermittent streams.

T1  - EFFECTS OF MOWING AND BURNING ON SHRUBLAND AND GRASSLAND BIRDS ON NANTUCKET ISLAND, MASSACHUSETTS: A JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AN  - 198643398
AB  - Throughout the United States, declines in breeding populations of grassland and shrubland birds have prompted conservation agencies and organizations to manage and restore early-successional habitats. These habitats support a variety of birds, some of which have been classified as generalists; thus, often these birds are thought to be less affected by habitat manipulation. More information, however, is needed on the response of early-successional generalists to habitat management, because conservation agencies are increasing their focus on the regional preservation and management of common species. On Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, the goal of the Partnership for Harrier Habitat Preservation (PHHP) has been to restore more than 373 ha of grassland for the island's population of Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus). This management program has entailed methods such as prescribed burning and mowing (e.g., brushcutting) to restore and maintain grassland habitat. Over a 3-year period, we found that songbird response to burning and mowing varied among species, depending on subtle habitat preferences and the intensity and type of management. In shrublands, Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) and Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) abundance declined in mowed areas but were unaffected by prescribed burning. In grasslands, Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) abundance showed no response to either burning or mowing, whereas Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) preferred unmanaged grasslands. In shrublands, mowing was the most effective method for restoring grassland habitat, whereas prescribed burning had little effect on abundances of shrubland birds and vegetation structure. In grasslands, both mowing and burning were successful in restricting shrubland encroachment and maintaining grassland habitat. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - High resilience of Mediterranean land snail communities to wildfires
AN  - 751623958
AB  - In the Mediterranean region, wildfires have devastating effects on animals with limited mobility. With their poor dispersal abilities, their habitats on vegetation and in litter, and their sensitivity to humidity and shade, we expected land snails to be an interesting model to assess short, medium and long-term impact of fires on fauna biodiversity and their resilience. Stratified sampling was carried out on 12 sampling sites in garrigues and forests of Provence (southeastern France), according to fire regime (number of fires, fire intervals and age of the last fire) over the past 30 years. Data were investigated using diversity indexes, Kruskal-Wallis test, dendrogram of affinities and Correspondence Analysis (CA). We found, however, that Mediterranean land snail communities are particularly resilient to fires. Although abundance is drastically reduced in the short-term, species richness and community diversity are preserved provided that the time lapse between two successive fires is longer than the time required for recovery (i.e. around 5 years). This high community resilience in the short-term may be partly due to ecological and ethological aptitudes of land snails. However, these astonishing results, which have implications for conservation biology, are mainly due to the presence, within burned areas, of cryptic refuges that allow initial land snail survival, malacofauna persistence after successive fires and consistent biogeographical patterns in the long-term.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the cumulative effects of postfire management on forest landscape dynamics in northeastern China
AN  - 230525467
AB  - We used the LANDIS model to study the long-term cumulative effects of postfire 10-year management (harvest and reforestation) on species abundance, age structure, and spatial pattern in the Tuqiang Forest Bureau on the northern slopes of the Great Hing'an Mountains after a catastrophic fire in 1987. Two simulation scenarios were constructed: the actual postfire management scenario and the natural regeneration scenario that assumed no postfire management activities occurred after the 1987 fire. Both scenarios were run with 10 replicated simulations per scenario over a 300-year period. Our results indicated that postfire management had a significant influence on species abundance, age structure, and spatial pattern. Postfire management effectively increased the abundance of coniferous trees (larch (Larix gmelinii) and Mongolian Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica)), increased the abundance of white birch in the short-term simulation stage, and decreased the abundance of white birch (Betula platyphylla) in the long run. The aggregation level of white birch responded similarly to postfire management - increasing initially, and then decreasing over time. However, compared with the natural regeneration scenario, postfire management resulted in more fragmented larch and Mongolian Scotch pine, which could last for about 100-150 years because of timber harvesting in the first 10 years postfire. In addition, the age structure of larch forests under the postfire management scenario changed dramatically during the 300 simulation years: the abundance of mature and old-growth age classes of larch forests decreased dramatically in the first 10 years, but then increased and exceeded that under the natural regeneration scenario after about 100 simulation years. Therefore, although postfire management had a positive cumulative effect (less fragmented and more larch abundance) on forest recovery at the long-term successional stage, postfire management, especially timber harvesting within the first 10 years after the 1987 fire, posed negative effects (more fragmented and less mature forests) at short- and mid-term successional stages (about 100 years).

T1  - Salvage Logging in the Montane Ash Eucalypt Forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria and Its Potential Impacts on Biodiversity
AN  - 201451631
AB  - The two major forms of disturbance in the montane ash eucalypt forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria (southeastern Australia) are clearfell logging and unplanned wildfires. Since the 1930s wildfire has been followed by intensive and extensive salvage-logging operations, which may proceed for many years after a wildfire has occurred. Although applied widely, the potential effects of salvage logging on native flora and fauna have been poorly studied. Our data indicate that the abundance of large trees with hollows is significantly reduced in forests subject to salvage harvesting. This has implications for the persistence of an array of such cavity-using vertebrates as the endangered arboreal marsupial, Leadbeater's possum ( Gymnobelidues leadbeateri). Salvage logging also reduces the prevalence of multiaged montane ash forests--places that typically support the highest diversity of arboreal marsupials and forest birds. Limited research has been conducted on the effects of salvage logging on plants; thus, we constructed hypotheses about potential impacts for further testing based on known responses to clearfell logging and key life history attributes. We predict many species, such as vegetatively resprouting tree ferns, will decline, as they do after clearfelling. We also suggest that seed regenerators, which typically regenerate well after fire or conventional clearfelling, will decline after salvage logging because the stimulation for germination (fire) takes place prior to mechanical disturbance (logging). Understory plant communities in salvage-logged areas will be dominated by a smaller suite of species, and those that are wind dispersed, have viable soil-stored seed remaining after salvage logging, or have deep rhizomes are likely to be advantaged. We recommend the following improvements to salvage-logging policies that may better incorporate conservation needs in Victorian montane ash forests: (1) exemption of salvage logging from some areas (e.g., old-growth stands and places subject to only partial stand damage); (2) increased retention of biological legacies on burned areas through variations in the intensity of salvage logging; and (3) reduction in the levels of physical disturbance on salvage-logged areas, especially through limited seedbed preparation and mechanical disturbance.

T1  - Postfire Logging in Riparian Areas
AN  - 201444479
AB  - We reviewed the behavior of wildfire in riparian zones, primarily in the western United States, and the potential ecological consequences of postfire logging. Fire behavior in riparian zones is complex, but many aquatic and riparian organisms exhibit a suite of adaptations that allow relatively rapid recovery after fire. Unless constrained by other factors, fish tend to rebound relatively quickly, usually within a decade after a wildfire. Additionally, fire and subsequent erosion events contribute wood and coarse sediment that can create and maintain productive aquatic habitats over time. The potential effects of postfire logging in riparian areas depend on the landscape context and disturbance history of a site; however, available evidence suggests two key management implications: (1) fire in riparian areas creates conditions that may not require intervention to sustain the long-term productivity of the aquatic network and (2) protection of burned riparian areas gives priority to what is left rather than what is removed. Research is needed to determine how postfire logging in riparian areas has affected the spread of invasive species and the vulnerability of upland forests to insect and disease outbreaks and how postfire logging will affect the frequency and behavior of future fires. The effectiveness of using postfire logging to restore desired riparian structure and function is therefore unproven, but such projects are gaining interest with the departure of forest conditions from those that existed prior to timber harvest, fire suppression, and climate change. In the absence of reliable information about the potential consequence of postfire timber harvest, we conclude that providing postfire riparian zones with the same environmental protections they received before they burned is justified ecologically. Without a commitment to monitor management experiments, the effects of postfire riparian logging will remain unknown and highly contentious. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Toward Meaningful Snag-Management Guidelines for Postfire Salvage Logging in North American Conifer Forests
AN  - 201361282
AB  - The bird species in western North America that are most restricted to, and therefore most dependent on, severely burned conifer forests during the first years following a fire event depend heavily on the abundant standing snags for perch sites, nest sites, and food resources. Thus, it is critical to develop and apply appropriate snag-management guidelines to implement postfire timber harvest operations in the same locations. Unfortunately, existing guidelines designed for green-tree forests cannot be applied to postfire salvage sales because the snag needs of snag-dependent species in burned forests are not at all similar to the snag needs of snag-dependent species in green-tree forests. Birds in burned forests have very different snag-retention needs from those cavity-nesting bird species that have served as the focus for the development of existing snag-management guidelines. Specifically, many postfire specialists use standing dead trees not only for nesting purposes but for feeding purposes as well. Woodpeckers, in particular, specialize on wood-boring beetle larvae that are superabundant in fire-killed trees for several years following severe fire. Species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker ( Picoides arcticus) are nearly restricted in their habitat distribution to severely burned forests. Moreover, existing postfire salvage-logging studies reveal that most postfire specialist species are completely absent from burned forests that have been (even partially) salvage logged. I call for the long-overdue development and use of more meaningful snag-retention guidelines for postfire specialists, and I note that the biology of the most fire-dependent bird species suggests that even a cursory attempt to meet their snag needs would preclude postfire salvage logging in those severely burned conifer forests wherein the maintenance of biological diversity is deemed important.

T1  - Landscape Models to Predict the Influence of Forest Structure on Tassel-Eared Squirrel Populations
AN  - 234216973
AB  - The tassel-eared squirrel (Sciurus aberti) is often used as an indicator species in southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Because of more than a century of fire suppression, grazing, and timber harvest, these forests have become increasingly prone to catastrophic wildfire, resulting in pressure to implement large-scale treatments to reduce fire threat and restore ecosystem function. However, such treatments could have dramatic effects on tassel-eared squirrels and other wildlife. Because of emerging plans for thinning southwestern forests to reduce fire threat, we undertook a modeling effort to produce spatial data to examine the results of proposed management actions on squirrel habitat. We used squirrel density and recruitment data from 9 study areas located in the Flagstaff region of northern Arizona, USA, linked with spatial data on forest structure developed from remote-sensing imagery. We used a multiscale approach to analyze relationships between forest structure and squirrel density and recruitment. We then used an information-theoretic approach to identify the most parsimonious models for both squirrel density and recruitment. The most strongly supported models of squirrel density included local-scale basal area and >60% canopy cover at the 65-ha spatial scale. For squirrel recruitment, 4 different models that included both local-scale basal area (m^sup 2^/ha) and variations of canopy cover over extents of approximately 160-305 ha were strongly supported. Using the most parsimonious models, we created spatial data layers representing both squirrel density and recruitment across an 800,000-ha landscape in northern Arizona. Our approach resulted in spatially explicit models that can be used in efforts to predict the effects of forest management on squirrel populations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of Mowing and Summer Burning on the Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus)
AN  - 234929522
AB  - Prescribed fire is used to reduce coverage of woody vegetation in early successional habitats, but burning may also result in direct and indirect mortality of reptiles inhabiting the burn site. Mowing prior to burning has been hypothesized to render grassland habitats unsuitable for the massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), thereby reducing the number of individuals that may be affected in the management unit at the time of burning. I evaluated the impact of mowing prior to summer burning on massasaugas at Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge, in northwestern Missouri, during the summer of 2003 using radiomarked snakes. Pre-burn mowing resulted in the direct mortality of three (43%) of seven radiomarked massasaugas present in the treatment area. Prescribed fire resulted in a mortality of one of two remaining individuals. Pre-burn mowing did not reduce mortalities as hypothesized and likely added to the overall snake mortality rate. Management alternatives other than mowing and prescribed fire when snakes are active should be considered when managing massasauga habitat. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Was Aldo Leopold Right about the Kaibab Deer Herd?
AN  - 733071326
AB  - In ecology textbooks prior to the 1970s, Aldo Leopold's classic story of predator control, overpopulation of deer, and habitat degradation on the Kaibab Plateau during the 1920s epitomized predator regulation of herbivore populations. However, the story disappeared from texts in the late 20th century after several papers noted uncertainties in estimations of the deer population and provided alternative explanations. We re-examined the case study by determining the age structure of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) on the plateau. Aspen comprises the majority of deer browse in the summer, and the absence of a normal cohort of aspen from the 1920s would indicate deer overpopulation. The number of aspen (at 1.4 m) dating to the 1920s was an order of magnitude lower than the null expectation. Other periods of unusual numbers of aspen included high numbers of aspen dating to the 1880s and 1890s (when regular surface fires ceased), few aspen dating from 1953 to 1962 (after a second irruption of the deer population), and very high numbers from 1968 to 1992 (coincident with widespread logging). These convergent lines of evidence support the idea of extreme deer herbivory in the 1920s, consistent with food limitation of deer at high populations (bottom-up control) and predation limitation at low deer populations (top-down control). Some uncertainty remains within the overall story, and this level of ambiguity is common in case studies that involve population ecology, land management, and people at the scale of 1,000 km^sup 2^ and 100 years. A complete version of the Kaibab deer story and its history would be a valuable, realistic case study for ecology texts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Henslow's Sparrow Winter-Survival Estimates and Response to Prescribed Burning
AN  - 234230859
AB  - Wintering Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) populations rely on lands managed with prescribed burning, but the effects of various burn regimes on their overwinter survival are unknown. We studied wintering Henslow's sparrows in coastal pine savannas at the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge, Jackson County, Mississippi, USA, during January and February 2001 and 2002. We used the known-fate modeling procedure in program MARK to evaluate the effects of burn age (1 or 2 growing seasons elapsed), burn season (growing, dormant), and calendar year on the survival rates of 83 radiomarked Henslow's sparrows. We found strong evidence that Henslow's sparrow survival rates differed by burn age (with higher survival in recently burned sites) and by year (with lower survival rates in 2001 likely because of drought conditions). We found some evidence that survival rates also differed by burn season (with higher survival in growing-season sites), although the effects of burn season were only apparent in recently burned sites. Avian predation was the suspected major cause of mortality (causing 6 of 14 deaths) with 1 confirmed loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) depredation. Our results indicated that recently burned savannas provide high-quality wintering habitats and suggested that managers can improve conditions for wintering Henslow's sparrows by burning a large percentage of savannas each year.

T1  - Canopy Removal Restores Habitat Quality for an Endangered Snake in a Fire Suppressed Landscape
AN  - 207253880
AB  - In the last two centuries, European fire suppression practices have produced increases in vegetation density and canopy cover in many landscapes. Potentially, increases in canopy cover could negatively affect small populations of nocturnal reptiles that use sun-exposed shelters for diurnal thermoregulation. We hypothesized that vegetation encroachment over rock outcrops might partly explain the recent decline of Australia's most endangered snake, the Broad-headed Snake Hoplocephalus bungaroides. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a field study in Morton National Park, southeastern Australia. We removed overhanging vegetation from above shaded rocks and compared their subsequent usage by reptiles to control (shaded) rocks. In spring, one year after canopy removal, experimental rocks were 10.3 C hotter than control rocks and were used as diurnal retreat sites by three species of reptiles, including the endangered Broad-headed Snake and its prey (Velvet Gecko, Oedura lesueurii). By contrast, no reptiles used control rocks as diurnal retreat sites. Our results show that modest canopy removal (~15% increase in canopy openness) can restore habitat quality for nocturnal reptiles. Future studies are needed to examine whether controlled burns can maintain an open canopy above sandstone rock outcrops. However, until effective fire management measures are in place, sapling removal from overgrown rock outcrops could help to protect small populations of endangered reptiles. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Utility of Dynamic-Landscape Metapopulation Models for Sustainable Forest Management: [1]
AN  - 201400343
AB  - We evaluated the utility of combining metapopulation models with landscape-level forest-dynamics models to assess the sustainability of forest management practices. We used the Brown Creeper ( Certhia americana
) in the boreal forests of northern Ontario as a case study. We selected the Brown Creeper as a potential indicator of sustainability because it is relatively common in the region but is dependent on snags and old trees for nesting and foraging; hence, it may be sensitive to timber harvesting. For the modeling we used RAMAS Landscape, a software package that integrates RAMAS GIS, population-modeling software, and LANDIS, forest-dynamics modeling software. Predictions about the future floristic composition and structure of the landscape under a variety of management and natural disturbance scenarios were derived using LANDIS. We modeled eight alternative forest management scenarios, ranging in intensity from no timber harvesting and a natural fire regime to intensive timber harvesting with salvage logging after fire. We predicted the response of the Brown Creeper metapopulation over a 160-year period and used future population size and expected minimum population size to compare the sustainability of the various management scenarios. The modeling methods were easy to apply and model predictions were sensitive to the differences among management scenarios, indicating that these methods may be useful for assessing and ranking the sustainability of forest management options. Primary concerns about the method are the practical difficulties associated with incorporating fire stochasticity in prediction uncertainty and the number of model assumptions that must be made and tested with sensitivity analysis. We wrote new software to help quantify the contribution of landscape stochasticity to model prediction uncertainty.

T1  - THE RESPONSES OF MAMMALS TO LA NIÑA (EL NIÑO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION)-ASSOCIATED RAINFALL, PREDATION, AND WILDFIRE IN CENTRAL AUSTRALIA
AN  - 221446687
AB  - In the Simpson Desert, central Australia, heavy rainfalls associated with the La Niña phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during 1999-2000 stimulated a pulse of primary productivity that prompted a rodent irruption during 2001, and subsequently an extensive wildfire in 2001-2002. More than 10,000 km^sup 2^ of spinifex habitat were burned. In this study we examine a time series of climatic variables, and small mammal and predator dynamics in the desert in 1999-2002; and a before-after-control-impact study investigating the effects of the wildfire on small mammals. Rodents showed a delayed numerical increase in response to rainfall, whereas terrestrial predators showed a delayed numerical increase in response to rodent density. These delayed responses suggest the existence of bottom-up trophic pathways. However, a reduction in primary productivity and increase in predators appeared to suppress rodent numbers in 2001-2002, indicating that bottom-up effects can be temporarily reversed in this system. Wildfire had negative impacts on the abundance of the desert mouse (Pseudomys desertor) and the overall richness of small mammal species. Several other species of small mammals also appeared to show brief negative responses to wildfire. The impacts of wildfire on small mammals appear attributable to a loss of habitat for spinifex-dependent species and increased exposure to predation in burned habitats. Because extensive wildfires can be predicted from patterns of rainfall and fuel accumulation, we recommend that land managers be proactive in recognizing and reducing conditions of fire hazard. We recommend that small-scale prescribed burns should be carried out to reduce the extent of wildfires and also increase the chance of maintaining potential refuges from predators. In addition, control of introduced predators during and after irruptions of rodents will be crucial to prevent predator-driven crashes of their populations and those of secondary prey species. ENSO-related climatic forecasts appear to be useful cues that can be incorporated into fire and predator management strategies in arid Australia. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Differential responses of Bolivian timber species to prescribed fire and other gap treatments
AN  - 744084567
AB  - We followed the establishment and growth response of 13 commercial tree species to canopy opening, above-ground biomass removal, and experimental burns of low and high intensities in a lowland dry forest in Bolivia. Three patterns of response to treatments were observed among the most abundant commercial tree species. (1) Shade-intolerant species regenerated mostly from seed and had the highest survival and growth rates following high-intensity burns. (2) Shade-tolerant species were abundant in gap control and plant removal treatments. Treatments had little effect on the height growth of these species. (3) Individuals of root sprouting species were most abundant following plant removal and low-intensity burn treatments. Treatments had little effect on the height growth of these species. The wide variation in species' responses to gap treatments found in this study not only reinforces the concept that species are distributed along a continuum of shade-tolerance levels, but that other aspects of species' biology, such as seed dispersal type or sprouting behavior, further differentiate regeneration strategies. The variety of regeneration strategies found among the species at this forest site will require a flexible management scheme that mixes more intensive silvicultural treatments such as prescribed burning with less intensive treatments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Conservation of Brazilian Amphibians
AN  - 201460915
AB  - Brazil is the world leader in amphibian diversity, with 765 species, most of which have been described in the last 40 years. The Brazilian Official List of Threatened Species and the results of a workshop for the Global Amphibian Assessment indicate that 26 species are threatened. The majority of these occur in the Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. The main threat to amphibians is the destruction of their habitats through deforestation, conversion into agricultural land, mining, wildfires, and infrastructure development and urbanization. In Brazil little is known about other causes of amphibian decline observed worldwide, such as pesticides, infectious diseases, climate change, invasive species, or wildlife trade. Brazilian conservation policies include such important legal instruments as the Official List of Threatened Species and the selection of priority areas for conservation measures in all of Brazil's major biomes. Although there is little information on geographic distributions and the natural history and ecology of the large majority of the currently recognized species, a number of important regional studies for amphibian conservation are under way. New species are discovered each year.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Denésoliné (Chipewyan) Knowledge of Barren-Ground Caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) Movements
AN  - 197726318
AB  - ABSTRACT. Semi-directed interviews relating to the traditional knowledge (TK) of barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) movements were conducted with elders and hunters from the Denésoliné (Chipewyan) community of Lutsël K'é, Northwest Territories, Canada. The objective was to document Denésoliné knowledge of past and present caribou migration patterns and record their explanations for perceived changes in movements. Elders recognized expected and unusual levels of variation in caribou movements. Local narratives show that Denésoliné communities have a fundamental awareness of caribou migration cycles. Most elders thought fire frequency and intensity had increased over their lifetimes and that caribou numbers and distribution had been affected. The majority of Lutsël K'é elders thought mining development was affecting caribou movements in some way. Elders believe that disturbance around traditional migration corridors and water crossings and disturbance of "vanguard" animals might be forcing caribou to use less optimal routes and influencing where they overwinter. Elders also believe that a lack of respect for caribou will cause the animals to deviate from their "traditional" migration routes and become unavailable to the people for a period of time. Wildlife management practices may need to further accommodate aboriginal perspectives in the future.

              
RÉSUMÉ. Des entrevues semi-dirigées relatives au savoir traditionnel (ST) sur les déplacements du caribou des toundras (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) ont été faites auprès d'aînés et de chasseurs de la communauté denésoliné (chippewyan) de Lutsël K'é, dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest au Canada. L'objectif était de documenter le savoir denésoliné concernant les habitudes migratoires passées et présentes du caribou, et de consigner les explications sur les changements perçus dans les déplacements. Les aînés ont reconnu des niveaux de variation anticipés et inusités dans la migration du caribou. Des récits locaux révèlent que les communautés denésoliné possèdent une connaissance fondamentale des cycles de migration du caribou. La plupart des aînés étaient d'avis que la fréquence et l'intensité des feux de forêt avaient augmenté au cours de leur vie et que cela avait eu un impact sur le nombre et la distribution des caribous. La majorité des aînés de Lutsël K'é pensaient que l'exploitation minière affectait les déplacements du caribou, d'une manière ou d'une autre. Ils estimaient que les perturbations près des corridors de migration et des traversées de cours d'eau traditionnelles, ainsi qu'une perturbation subie par les animaux formant «l'avantgarde» de la harde, pourraient forcer les bêtes à suivre un trajet moins optimal et avoir une incidence sur leur site d'hivernage. Les aînés croyaient en outre qu'un manque de respect envers le caribou amènerait la harde à s'écarter de ses routes de migration «traditionnelles», la rendant inaccessible aux Autochtones pour une certaine durée. À l'avenir, il faudrait sans doute que les pratiques de gestion de la faune tiennent davantage compte du point de vue des Autochtones.

              
Denésoliné elders appear to recognize differences between short-term fluctuations and long-term shifts in caribou movements. They have observed what seem to be three different kinds of variation in caribou movements: "expected" variation (movements seen regularly in an individual's lifetime); "unusual" variation (changes seen once in a generation or less); and "unprecedented" variation, which is ominous or dangerous change, never witnessed before or recounted by an individual's predecessors. It is important to determine the scale of the variation to understand how elders perceive the change in caribou movements. Denésoliné elder [Joe Michel] reported that caribou were still using the "same" migration routes, although they did not migrate through the [Luts]ël K'é area as they used too. This could be an example of "expected" variation in caribou movements, especially since the caribou returned to the Lutsël K'é area, for the first time in three years, just two months after the interview took place. The early arrival of caribou cows in spring in the Lutsël K'é area (measured from the level of development of the caribou fetus), as well as the lack of regularity in washing ashore of drowned caribou at Reliance, could indicate "unusual" or "unprecedented" temporal and spatial variation in caribou movements. Knowledge of "backup areas" to harvest caribou may have been a Denésoliné response to expected changes in caribou movements. The use of "backup strategies," or the changing of food species entirely, may have been a response to an unusual or unprecedented change in caribou migration routes.

T1  - Response Of A Terrestrial Mollusc Community To An Autumn Prescribed Burn In A Rare Wetland Prairie Of Western Oregon, USA
AN  - 195529100
AB  - Conservation and management of grasslands may involve the use of prescribed fire to reinstate a historical disturbance regime recently suppressed by humans. I used traps to describe the terrestrial mollusc community in a rare wetland prairie ecosystem of western Oregon, USA over a 3-year period in an adjacent burned and unburned wetland prairie parcel beginning 1 year following an autumn prescribed fire. Species richness was lower throughout the burned area for the duration of the study period and mollusc abundance was lower in the first postburn year, but steadily increased over time, surpassing the adjacent burned area by the third postburn year. According to Multi-response Permutation Procedure, the mollusc community in the adjacent burned area differed significantly from the unburned prairie each year since the burn, suggesting that fire history may structure the wetland prairie mollusc community. Indicator species analysis identified that Deroceras reticulatum and Monadenia fidelis were indicator species for unburned wetland prairie, while Catinella rhederi and Vertigo modesta were indicator species for burned habitat at the study site. Since fire appears to decrease wetland prairie mollusc diversity and abundance, prescribed burns should be conducted in accordance with refuges, to provide a source population for colonizing molluscs and for other animals with unknown responses to fire.

T1  - Available nitrogen: A time-based study of manipulated resource islands
AN  - 763112029
AB  - Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of available nitrogen are critical determinants of the distribution and abundance of plants and animals in ecosystems. Evidence for the resource island theory suggests that soils below tree and shrub canopies contain higher amounts of resources, including available nitrogen, than are present in interspace areas. Disturbances, such as prescribed fire and tree removal, are common management practices in shrub-woodland ecosystems, but it is not known if these practices affect resource islands. We examined temporal variation in resource islands of available nitrogen and their retention after fire and woody plant removal. From August 1997 to October 1998, soil nitrate (NO^sub 3^^sup -^) and ammonium (NH^sub 4^^sup +^) were measured monthly from canopy and interspace plots within four juniper-sagebrush sites along a precipitation gradient in central Oregon, USA. At each site, soil samples were collected from untreated plots, plots in which woody plants were removed, and those treated with prescribed fire in fall 1997. In burned treatments, canopy concentrations were significantly higher than interspace concentrations throughout the measurement period. Canopy NO^sub 3^^sup -^ and NH^sub 4^^sup +^ concentrations were significantly higher on burned vs. unburned treatments for four months after fire. After woody plant removal, NO^sub 3^^sup -^ and NH^sub 4^^sup +^ concentrations did not differ from the controls. Untreated control areas had higher NO^sub 3^^sup -^ and NH^sub 4^^sup +^ concentrations under juniper canopies for nearly all months. Wetter sites had smaller differences between canopy and interspace concentrations through time than did the two drier sites. In relation to NO^sub 3^^sup -^ and NH^sub 4^^sup +^ in this ecosystem, resource islands appear to be more ephemeral in wetter sites, and more pronounced following fire disturbances than in controls or those treated by woody plant removal.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fire generates spatial gradients in herbivory: An example from a Florida sandhill ecosystem
AN  - 219015023
AB  - Disturbance can directly affect the interactions among species at different trophic levels. Because disturbances are typically localized, and many consumers are constrained in their mobility, disturbances can generate spatial variability in trophic interactions. Here, we consider how fire alters plant-insect interactions in a longleaf pine ecosystem in central Florida, USA. We hypothesized that fire in the short term would directly depress herbivore abundance, and that the rate of re-colonization by herbivores would depend upon distance from the edge of the recently burned area. Thus, fire should generate spatially varying herbivory. Orthopterans are dominant insect consumers in our system, and many species are flightless, either as juveniles or adults; these species are particularly likely to show constrained post-fire mobility. We quantified insect abundance and herbivory levels on eight common understory plants in the edge and interior of three recently burned sites. As predicted, insect abundance at the edge of burned areas was much higher than in the interior. In addition, all plant species experienced at least twice the level of herbivory in the edge than in the interior of burned sites. This demonstrates that disturbance can create strong spatial variation in the magnitude of trophic interactions. We suggest that larger burns may aid in plant management by reducing herbivory, whereas the presence of unburned refugia may be critical to insect conservation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fire regime in a conservation reserve in Chihuahua, Mexico
AN  - 230523165
AB  - Fire regime characteristics were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees in the Tutuaca reserve, a newly designated protected area in the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Chihuahua. The reserve was created to protect thick-billed parrot nesting habitat (large snags) and a relict forest of Chihuahua spruce (Picea chihuahuana Martínez). We collected fire-scarred samples from conifers (Pinus ayacahuite Ehrenb., Pinus durangensis Martínez, and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in three 25-ha sites arrayed at different watershed positions, from a low site adjacent to the spruce trees up to the watershed divide. Fire analysis periods began in 1702, 1704, or 1761 and continued through the final fire in 1955 (two sites) or 1995. All sites had frequent fire regimes (mean fire interval (MFI) 3.9-5.2 years; MFI for years in which 25% or more of the samples were scarred: 6.9-8.4 years). Almost all fires occurred before cambial growth began or early during the season of cambial growth. Fire years were significantly dry, and the years immediately preceding fire were significantly wet. After 1955, no further fires occurred at two of the three study sites, a pattern similar to that observed elsewhere in northern Mexico. The third site had fires in 1987 and 1995. The extended firefree period in portions of the Tutuaca landscape may result in fuel accumulation and eventually in severe wildfire. For effective conservation of fire-susceptible habitat features, managers should seek to incorporate surface fire as a management tool. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Relative Importance of Reproductive Biology and Establishment Ecology for Persistence of a Rare Shrub in a Fragmented Landscape
AN  - 201448248
AB  - Verticordia fimbrilepis (Turcz) ssp.  						fimbrilepis (Myrtaceae) is an endangered shrub that occurs in a number of populations varying in size and landscape context. We compared the importance of factors associated with its reproductive biology with that of factors influencing the regeneration niche in survival of small, isolated populations in contrasting habitat fragments. Small populations on road verges had equal or greater diversity of insect visitors to flowers, rates of pollination, and seed production compared with larger populations in conservation reserves.  						V. fimbrilepis seeds remained dormant in the soil for at least 30 months, and germination was stimulated by smoke. Plants were killed by fire, but mass recruitment from soil-stored seed reserves occurred in the first and second winters following fire. Our studies showed some seedling recruitment between fires, but this was strongly related to the availability of competition-free establishment sites. Whether this is enough to replace older plants as they die and thereby sustain stable populations is unknown and probably varies with the landscape. Environmental variation between fire episodes influenced population size. Drought increased mortality, but wetter years encouraged interfire recruitment. Most populations are declining and cannot recover without the occurrence of fire. In a fragmented agricultural landscape, fire suppression is the primary management practice. This may adversely affect rare species such as  						V. fimbrilepis and others with similar life histories that rely on a particular fire regime to persist. Population persistence is more likely to be related to stochastic environmental events than to factors associated with reproductive biology. 			 [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]	

              
 					Verticordia fimbrilepis(Turcz) ssp.  						fimbrilepis (Myrtaceae) es una hierba en peligro de extinci&oacute;n que ocurre en varias poblaciones de diferente tama&ntilde;o y contexto paisaj&iacute;stico. Examinamos la importancia relativa de factores asociados con su biolog&iacute;a reproductiva comparados con factores que influyen en el nicho de regeneraci&oacute;n en la supervivencia de poblaciones peque&ntilde;as y aisladas en fragmentos de h&aacute;bitat contrastante. Poblaciones peque&ntilde;as en el borde de caminos tuvieron igual o mayor diversidad de insectos visitadores de flores, tasa de polinizaci&oacute;n y producci&oacute;n de semillas que poblaciones m&aacute;s grandes en &aacute;reas protegidas. Semillas de V. fimbrilepis permanecieron latentes en el suelo durante 30 meses por lo menos, y la germinaci&oacute;n fue estimulada por humo. El fuego mat&oacute; a las plantas, pero hubo reclutamiento masivo a partir de reservas de semillas almacenadas en el suelo en el primero y segundo invierno despu&eacute;s del fuego. Nuestros estudios mostraron algo de reclutamiento de semillas entre incendios pero esto se relacion&oacute; robustamente con la disponibilidad de sitios de establecimiento libres de competencia. Se desconoce si esto es suficiente para reemplazar a las plantas viejas que mueren y que por tanto sostienen poblaciones estables y probablemente var&iacute;a con el paisaje. La variaci&oacute;n ambiental entre episodios de fuego influy&oacute; en el tama&ntilde;o de la poblaci&oacute;n. La sequ&iacute;a increment&oacute; la mortalidad, pero a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s h&uacute;medos estimularon el reclutamiento post incendio. La mayor&iacute;a de las poblaciones est&aacute;n declinando y no pueden recuperarse sin la ocurrencia de fuego. La supresi&oacute;n de fuego es la pr&aacute;ctica de manejo primaria en un paisaje agr&iacute;cola fragmentado. Esto puede afectar adversamente a especies raras como  					 V. fimbrilepis y otras con historias de vida similares que dependen de un determinado r&eacute;gimen de fuego para persistir. Es m&aacute;s probable que la persistencia de la poblaci&oacute;n se relacione m&aacute;s con eventos ambientales estoc&aacute;sticos que con factores asociados con su biolog&iacute;a reproductiva.

T1  - The response of mammals to forest fire and timber harvest in the North American boreal forest
AN  - 233352105
AB  - Fisher and Wilkinson reviews and compares the effects of forest fire and timber harvest on mammalian abundance and diversity, throughout successional time in the boreal forest of North America, where temporal trends in mammal abundance and diversity are generally similar for both harvested and burned stands, with some differences occurring in the initiation stage. Where forest structure was considered, the presence of downed woody material, live residual trees and standing dead wood were shown to facilitate convergence of mammal communities to a pre-disturbance state for both disturbance types. Mammalian assemblages differed considerably between successional stages, emphasizing the importance of maintaining stands on the landscape when implementing forest management strategies.

T1  - Impacts of land management practices on a population of nine-banded armadillos in northern Florida
AN  - 230199774
AB  - Over a 12-year period (1992-2003), we examined the impact of prescribed burning and hardwood removal on a population of nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) located at Tall Timbers Research Station just north of Tallahassee, Florida. Although these armadillos are often found in close proximity to humans, there currently are no data on how they are affected by human impacts on the environment. Responses to annual burns between 1992-1997 indicated that in some years armadillos, particularly adults, avoided areas that had been burned, but effects were inconsistent and relatively weak. In contrast, hardwood removal during 1998-2000 coincided with a significant decline in population numbers that continued through 2003. However, interpretation of hardwood removal effects was complicated by the occurrence of a severe drought during the same time period. Comparisons between animals in logged and unlogged parts of the study area during the period of hardwood removal revealed few differences, suggesting drought was an important influence. However, because our population continued to decline after the drought ended, it seems likely that hardwood removal generated more persistent effects that were temporarily masked by the drought. We observed armadillos frequently in logged areas, probably because few other habitat choices were available. Armadillos weighed less during and after hardwood removal than prior to it. Although adult reproductive behavior appeared largely unaffected by logging, numbers of juveniles captured and recruited declined significantly with the onset of hardwood removal. There was no evidence that the disturbance from logging caused increases in distances moved by animals that remained in the study area. Our results may have broader implications for predicting how armadillo populations in Latin America will be affected by similar land management practices. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Development of Brachystegia-Julbernardia woodland after clear-felling in central Zambia: Evidence for high resilience
AN  - 1151988437
AB  - Question: Does the development of Brachystegia-Julbernardia (miombo) woodland after felling, and under a variable fire regime, occur via a serai stage of fire-tolerant species?

              
Location: Four sites in central Zambia, Africa.

              
Methods: Trees in replicate plots were clear-cut and stumps and resprouts enumerated. Species recruited into the tree layer (> 2.0 m tall) were monitored for 11 years (1991-2001) and fire occurrence and herbaceous biomass assessed annually to determine fuel loads.

              
Results: Fire frequency was variable at the study sites and fuel loads were generally too low to suppress woodland regeneration after felling. However, at one site a change from low to high fire frequency arrested woodland development and triggered a regression towards a 'fire-trap' vegetation type in which a few fire-tolerant species survived. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that miombo woodland regeneration is facilitated by a sere of fire-tolerant species. All regrowth after felling was from resprouting plants present before felling. Trees with a previous history of felling sprouted more vigorously than trees that had not been felled before. Species richness in the tree layer increased with time since felling because resprout species had different height growth rates.

              
Conclusion: The resilience of miombo trees after clear-felling is largely due to their capacity to regenerate vegetatively from resprouts and stumps after release from frequent fires. Coppicing is therefore recommended as a suitable management technique for miombo woodland in central southern Africa. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - INFLUENCE OF FIRE ON BACHMAN'S SPARROW, AN ENDEMIC NORTH AMERICAN SONGBIRD
AN  - 234193784
AB  - Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), a near endemic songbird of the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem, is known to respond positively to prescribed fires. The influence of season (growing vs. dormant) and frequency (1 to ≥4 yr since burning) of fire on density of Bachman's sparrows, however, is poorly understood. We examined effects of fire on density of Bachman's sparrows in longleaf pine forests at the Conecuh National Forest, Alabama, and Blackwater River State Forest, Florida, USA. Density of Bachman's sparrows was greater the first 3 years after burning than ≥4 years after burning, and season of burning had little effect on the density of Bachman's sparrows. Percent coverage by grass had a greater influence on density of Bachman's sparrows than either season or frequency of burning. Percent canopy cover had a strong negative effect on coverage of grass but had a weaker effect on grass at stands burned frequently during the growing season. Growing-season fires (Apr-Sep) did not adversely affect density of Bachman's sparrows. Results from our study suggest that management and restoration of longleaf pine communities probably can be accomplished best by burning on a 2-3-year rotation during the growing season, when most fires historically occurred. Suppression of fire, or burning at intervals >4-5 years, will greatly reduce or eliminate habitat required by Bachman's sparrows. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Small-Mammal Relationships with Down Wood and Antelope Bitterbrush in Ponderosa Pine Forests of Central Oregon
AN  - 197640355
AB  - The influence of down wood on fire behavior in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in central Oregon is much understood. However, little is known about down-wood affiliations with wildlife in this area. Antelope bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) contributes to wildfires, nitrogen fixation, and the food web, yet its influence on small-mammal populations remains poorly defined. In this study, population density, survival, and reproductive status of yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis), and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are estimated under three down-wood and shrub-cover conditions in ponderosa pine/antelope bitterbrush forests of Oregon. The odds for golden-mantled ground squirrel survival are 4.2 times greater on units with high (x = 117.8 m^sup 3^/ha) versus low down-wood volume (x = 15.8 m^sup 3^/ha), and each 35.1-m^sup 3^/ha increase in down wood coincides with a 10% increase in ground squirrel density. Yellow-pine chipmunk densities are 57% higher on units with high (x = 31.2%) versus low total shrub cover (x = 9.2%), and 4.4 and 2.3% increases in total shrub and live bitterbrush cover, respectively, coincide with 10% increases in chipmunk density. Deer mouse populations are little affected by down-wood volume or shrub cover. Study results suggest that management activities influencing down wood or bitterbrush will likely affect the composition of small-mammal communities through population changes in one or more small-mammal species.

T1  - AVIAN RESPONSE TO FOREST MANAGEMENT AND MILITARY TRAINING ACTIVITIES AT FORT BENNING, GEORGIA
AN  - 230549569
AB  - Evaluating intensity and effects of land use disturbance is difficult, especially in sites with multiple land use. We conducted point counts to determine if abundance of bird species could be used to assess military training and forestry management practices at Fort Benning, Georgia. We evaluated heavy and light use sites in the 1st growing season after prescribed fire and in the 3rd growing season post-fire. Results focus on species common to early successional habitats and pine-grasslands and on forest species and habitat generalists. In the 3rd growing season postfire, Indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and northern bobwhites (Colinus uirginianus) were more abundant in recently burned heavy use sites than in light use sites. Conversely, red-eyed vireos (Vireo olivaceus) were more abundant in light use sites in the 3rd growing season post-fire than in recently burned, heavy use sites. Further study could help determine if these species are indicators of disturbance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - ECOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FUNGI AND WOODPECKER CAVITY SITES
AN  - 211299961
AB  - The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

T1  - The distribution and habitat characteristics of a threatened lucanid beetle Hoplogonus simsoni in north-east Tasmania
AN  - 862945625
AB  - The distribution and characteristics of habitat utilized by a threatened species of stag beetle in north-east Tasmania Hoplogonus simsoni (Coleoptera: Lucanidae), were examined as a first step in the development of conservation management objectives for the species. The beetle was found to have a restricted distribution of 250 km^sup 2^ and its regional distribution appeared to be related to the occurrence of granitic geology and a moderately high rainfall at low elevations. The species was patchily distributed across its range. High-density populations of the species were restricted to the eastern part of its distribution, but over most of its range it occurred at very low densities. Relative abundances of H. simsoni were greatest in wet eucalypt forest, with significantly fewer beetles found in mixed forest and rainforest. Dry eucalypt forest was found to be unsuitable habitat although the beetle was found to occur in the ecotone between wet and dry eucalypt forest. Potential wet forest habitat for the species is estimated to encompass 18 200 ha or 72% of its range. The species was not found in areas of wet eucalypt forest that had been converted to pine plantation. However, H. simsoni was found to occur in wet eucalypt forest regenerating after clearfelling and some of the highest density populations of the species occurred in 70 year old wet eucalypt forest regenerating following a wildfire. The relationship between various habitat variables and the occurrence of the beetle was investigated using Generalized Additive Modelling and robust regression. The presence of wet eucalypt forest below 300 m altitude; slope less than 5°; a deep leaf litter layer; and a forest structure with a well-developed canopy best explained the occurrence of the beetle. These habitat characteristics probably relate to a requirement for a cool, moist, stable microclimate and an absence of wildfire for some time. The potential habitat of H. simsoni as identified in this study is poorly reserved across its range and a high percentage has been identified by the forest industry as having potential for conversion to pine plantation. This highlights the importance of having mechanisms for "off-reserve" conservation of threatened species, like H. simsoni, which are often poorly represented in or completely absent from formal reserves.

T1  - Population status and conservation of the Critically Endangered Burmese Star Tortoise Geochelone platynota in central Myanmar
AN  - 222315888
AB  - The Critically Endangered Burmese star tortoise Geochelone platynota is endemic to the dry zone of central Myanmar. Although quantitative assessments are lacking, populations are believed to be in decline throughout its limited range due to over-collecting for international markets. We conducted star tortoise surveys during 2000-2001 at two sites in central Myanmar: Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary, a protected area established in 1998-1999, and Myaleik Taung, an area recently proposed for protected status. G. platynota populations of global conservation significance were found at both sites. Because tortoises are protected by local religious beliefs and commercial collecting is so far non-existent, the Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung offer excellent prospects for star tortoise conservation. The Sanctuary is well patrolled, protected from wildfires, and access is rigorously controlled. Recommended conservation actions at Myaleik Taung include management of livestock grazing, prescribed burning, and elimination of fuelwood cutting. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effects of grassland management using fire on habitat occupancy and conservation of birds in a mosaic landscape
AN  - 751613657
AB  - Prescribed burning is routinely used to improve grazing in Pyrenean rangelands affected by an overall trend of land abandonment. This study considers the environmental variables influencing habitat occupancy by birds and the consequences of the use of fire in range management for bird conservation. Bird use and habitat structure of 11 cover types, the result of specific management regimes, were monitored for two breeding seasons in a mosaic landscape. Three main gradients of avian composition, corresponding to tree cover, shrub volume and grazing intensity, were identified from canonical correspondence analysis. The structure of the bird community seemed more intensely affected by species-specific selection of cover types than by the birds' use of multiple patches. Out of a total of 10 bird species analysed by a simultaneous confidence intervals procedure, four species with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe (Emberiza cia, Lullula arborea, Saxicola torquata and Lanius collurio) preferred managed grassland. Three types of grassland with shrubs (derived from single or repeated burning) had the highest bird conservation index (taking into account specific status and abundance of the bird assemblage), whereas forests showed middle or low values. The relation (P = 0.054) of this index to the logarithm of the pastoral value (which includes density and grazing quality of grasses) in currently managed cover types suggests that the objectives of grassland recovery by appropriate management practices and those of bird conservation coincide in our study area.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of a fire-retardant chemical to fathead minnows in experimental streams
AN  - 609979684; 14535643
AB  - Each year millions of liters of fire-retardant chemicals are applied to wildfires across the nation. Recent laboratory studies with long-term fire-retardant chemicals indicate a significant photoenhanced toxicity of products containing sodium ferrocyanide corrosion inhibitors. Our objective of this study was to determine the toxicity of fire-retardant chemicals to fathead minnows during exposure in experimental outdoor streams.

              
Stream tests were conducted to determine the potential toxicity of a pulse of exposure as might occur when fire retardant chemical is rinsed from the watershed by rainfall. Two artificial 55-meter experimental streams were dosed with different concentrations of Fire-Trol® GTS-R, or uncontaminated for a control. Replicate groups of fathead minnows were added to screened containers (10 fish per container) and exposed to retardant chemicals in the recirculating flow of the stream for up to 6 hours.

              
Under field conditions toxicity of GTS-R only occurred in the presence of sunlight. When GTS-R was tested on sunny days, 100% mortality occurred. However, when tested during heavily overcast conditions, no mortality occurred.

              
Lethal concentrations of cyanide were measured when GTS-R with YPS exposures were conducted under sunny conditions, but not under cloudy conditions, indicating that a minimum UV level is necessary to induce toxicity as well as the release of cyanide from YPS. The toxicity observed with GTS-R was likely associated with lethal concentrations of cyanide. Rainwater runoff following applications of this fire-retardant at the recommended rate could result in lethal concentrations in small ponds and streams receiving limited water flow under sunny conditions.

              
In addition to avoiding application to aquatic habitats, it is important to consider characteristics of the treated site including soil binding affinity and erosive properties.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) brood microhabitat selection in the southern appalachians
AN  - 234955839
AB  - -Brood cover is a critical component of ruffed grouse habitat during a period when chick mortality may be high. We compared microhabitat characteristics at ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) brood locations with random locations to determine characteristics selected by females with broods in the Appalachian region of Virginia and West Virginia. Females with broods used forested sites with a well-developed overstory canopy (>70%). These sites had a higher abundance of arthropods in the first 3 wk after hatch (P = 0.02), taller ground cover (P < 0.1) and higher percent ground cover (P < 0.1) in the first 6 wk after hatch than random sites. Total woody stem densities were not different (P > 0.1) between brood and random sites as has been found in several studies from more northern sites. Most management prescriptions for ruffed grouse brood habitat are based on increasing hardwood stem densities; our results suggest alternative habitat management techniques that promote ground cover, such as prescribed burning and forest stand thinning, may be more appropriate in the southern Appalachian region.

T1  - Snag use by foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) in a recently burned eastern boreal forest
AN  - 196448615
AB  - We studied snag use for foraging by Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) one year after a fire in an eastern black spruce (Picea mariana) boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We searched for signs of foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in northeastern North America. Received 6 December 2001, accepted 14 December 2002.              RESUME.-Nous avons etudie l'utilisation des chicots a des fins d'alimentation par le Pic a dos noir (Picoides arcticus) un an apres feu dans une pessiere noire (Picea mariana) de l'est de la foret boreale au Quebec, Canada. Nous avons cherche des marques d'alimentation (ecorce soulevee et trous d'excavation) de Pics a dos noir sur 6,536 chicots echantillonnes dans 56 placettes situees dans des portions de fore brulees preservees de la coupe de recuperation. Un modele de regression logistique a ete developpe base sur la presence ou l'absence de marques d'alimentation. Nos resultats ont montre que les Pics a dos noir utilisaient les chicots de plus gros diametre et moins deteriores par le feu (qualifies de chicots de haute qualite). Des observations directes d'individus s'alimentant sur 119 chicots ont egalement montre que les caracteristiques des arbres utilises correspondaient a celles determinees par le modele pour des chicots de haute qualite. Finalement, nous avons examine la relation entre la disponibilite alimentaire et les caracteristiques des chicots en mesurant la densite de trous de larves de longicorne pour 30 chicots de differentes classes de diametre et de deterioration. Les chicots de haute qualite contenaient de plus fortes densites de proies (trous de longicornes) que les chicots de plus faible diametre et plus deteriores. Nous recommandons que des blocs de forets contenant des chicots de large diametre et moins deteriores par le feu soient preserves de la coupe de recuperation dans les forets boreales recemment brulees du nord-est de l'Amerique du Nord.

T1  - The response of boreal forest songbird communities to fire and post-fire harvesting
AN  - 230532252
AB  - Post-fire timber harvesting (salvage logging) is becoming more prevalent as logging companies try to recover some of the economic losses caused by fire. Because salvaging is a relatively new practice and because of the common perception that burned areas are of little value to wildlife, few guidelines exist for salvaging operations. We surveyed birds in unburned and burned stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), mixedwood, and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) to characterize the post-fire bird community in commercially important forest types. The effects of salvage logging were examined in mixedwood and jack pine. Using fixed-radius point counts, a total of 1430 individuals representing 51 species were detected during this study. Community analysis revealed that burned forests supported a distinct species assemblage of songbirds relative to unburned forests and that salvage logging significantly altered this community. An examination of guild composition showed that resident species, canopy and cavity nesters, and insectivores were the least likely to be detected in salvaged areas. Species less sensitive to salvage logging tended to be habitat generalists, omnivores, and species that nest on the ground or in shrubs. We suggest alternative management strategies that may help reduce the impact of salvage logging on the boreal forest songbird community.

T1  - Impacts of logging, fire and grazing regimes on bird species assemblages of the Pilliga woodlands of New South Wales
AN  - 862945617
AB  - We investigated the composition and distribution of bird assemblages in the continuous Pilliga woodlands of northwest New South Wales in relation to floristic assemblages and disturbance (logging, fire and grazing) patterns. Boxironbark woodlands contained high densities of White Cypress Pine Callitris glaucophylla and Narrow-leaved lronbark Eucalyptus crebra, had a sparse, depauperate understorey, and were associated with frequent, intense logging and infrequent fires (due to fire exclusion and the use of grazing for fuel reduction). Box-ironbark woodlands were characterized by high frequencies of 12 bird species that occurred throughout the Pilliga and low frequencies of many other species. Blakely's Red Gum E. blakelyi woodlands typical of creeks and Broad-leaved Ironbark E. fibrosa woodlands typical of poor soils contained lower densities or smaller trees of C. glaucophylla and E. crebra, had a moderately dense, diverse understorey, and were associated with infrequent low-intensity logging and moderately frequent wildfire. Bird species assemblages of Broad-leaved Ironbark woodlands were similar to those of box-ironbark woodlands. Blakely's Red Gum woodlands were characterized by 36 bird species that were virtually absent from box-ironbark and Broadleaved ironbark woodlands, including 10 threatened and declining species. The 10 are among 48 woodland species that are known or thought to be declining and that are dependent on woodlands with mature trees and grassy or patchy grass/shrub understorey. We conclude that these species have declined in the Pilliga and will continue to decline under existing disturbance regimes, particularly in box-ironbark woodlands. We suggest adaptive management strategies for maintaining and rehabilitating their habitats. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effect of prescribed burning on epigeic springtails (Insecta: Collembola) of woodland litter
AN  - 234954865
AB  - Species richness, frequency and density of litter-dwelling springtails (Collembola) were analyzed from woodland litter samples collected for 4 y, over a 12 y interval, from The East Woods of The Morton Arboretum, Lisle, Illinois. The 162 samples were divided equally between areas that had been previously burned and areas that had not been burned. There were significantly fewer springtail species in burned areas and 8 of the 10 most common species had lower frequencies in burned areas. The effect of fire varied for the 30 species identified in the study. Isotoma notabilis, Lepidocyrtus spp., Neanura muscorum and Tomocerus flavescens had a significantly higher frequency and density in unburned areas and Isotoma viridis and Xenylla grisea had a significantly higher frequency and density in burned areas. The mean dry weight of litter from 126 samples (equal number from burned and unburned areas) over 3 y was significantly heavier from the unburned areas. To maintain the richness of the litter invertebrates of forest ecosystems where prescribed burning is used, it is proposed that the scheduling of annual fires be changed to every 2 or 3 y. Before the use of fire, scattered refuge areas should also be established and maintained to enhance invertebrate survival.

T1  - Prediction of the spatial distribution and relative abundance of ground-dwelling mammals using remote sensing imagery and simulation models
AN  - 739467057
AB  - We present an approach that allows current, retrospective and future relative abundances of mammal species to be predicted across landscapes. A spatial generalized regression model of species relative abundance based on habitat quality and time since disturbance was combined with coverages of the spatial distribution of habitat quality derived from a simulation model which predicts the historical and future spatial arrangement of forest habitat. The strength of this approach is that the input habitat data can be derived as part of a standard forest inventory mapping program with the addition of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. Furthermore, it operates at the scale used for wildlife management in Australia, which makes it widely applicable. To demonstrate the approach we use data collected over 20 years on the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and the large wallabies (red-necked wallaby, Macropus rufogriseus, and swamp wallaby, Wallabia bicolor) and their habitats following wildfire. Results indicate the relative abundance of the potoroo has increased, from initially sparse numbers of less than 0.5 % of plot-night occurrences to close to 3% approximately twenty years after a major fire event. The large wallabies by contrast decreased in relative abundance from about 20% since the major fire event. Presently the relative abundance of large wallabies was modelled at 2% of plot-nights with tracks which was very low. Predictions of future relative abundance without additional disturbance were low, with the region likely to be unsuitable for the species in the next 5 years. These models offer tools for investigating the current and historical abundances of key species which can provide data to forest managers for wildlife management thereby translating current scientific understanding into tools suitable for every-day use by forest managers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Seed gene flow and fine-scale structure in a Mediterranean pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) using nuclear microsatellite markers
AN  - 723094578
AB  - The Mediterranean populations of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) are typically small and have a scattered distribution, being threatened by human activities and forest fires. In the framework of the genetic-resources conservation program of this species, a native multi-age stand located in a Mediterranean area (central Spain) was studied using three highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellites (SSRs). Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using Moran's index in order to detect fine-scale structure in both natural regeneration and mature trees. The spatial pattern of seed flow based on dispersed progeny was studied using a highly reliable subset of parent-offspring matches obtained by means of parentage analysis and simulation-based calculation of statistical confidence. Maritime pine showed a fine-scale structure at the seedling stage. In natural regeneration, the autocorrelograms indicated a patch size of approximately 10 m. The fine-scale structure seems to be produced by a restricted seed gene flow. In fact, there was an excess of parent-offspring matches in a radius of 15 m from the parent trees. Pines with a heavy seed, such as P. pinaster, are expected to have a short dispersal distance, thus producing a fine-scale structure. However, the fine-scale structure did not persist in the mature trees. Within-population genetic structure in Mediterranean pines may be affected by a number of post-dispersal events (e.g. mortality due to the severity of the Mediterranean climate and animal-mediated secondary dispersal during the summer period). Thus, great alteration in the pattern produced by the initial seed rain and differences in genetic structure between tree cohorts are expected.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Terrestrial wildlife responses to logging and fire in a Bolivian tropical humid forest
AN  - 858438538
AB  - Logging and wildfire are significant anthropogenic disturbance agents in tropical forests. We compared the abundance and species richness of selected terrestrial wildlife taxa including small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and terrestrial invertebrates in areas burned by wildfire and then logged and in adjacent undisturbed areas of a tropical humid forest in Bolivia. Disturbed areas had 24% less canopy cover than undisturbed areas but had 2.6 times the cover of large woody debris. Understory cover did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed areas. Small mammal abundance and species richness in disturbed areas were 43 and 70% higher, respectively, than in adjacent undisturbed areas. Herpetofaunal abundance did not differ significantly among disturbed and undisturbed areas, but trends for higher abundance were observed for both reptiles and amphibians in disturbed areas. Herpetofaunal species richness was significantly higher in disturbed compared to undisturbed areas. Total terrestrial invertebrate abundance, as estimated by pitfall traps, was significantly higher in undisturbed compared to disturbed areas mostly due to higher abundances of Formicidae and Blattidae. However, two invertebrate groups, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera (larvae) were more abundant in disturbed areas. Wildlife conservation strategies for areas where logging or wildfire occur should take into account species- or guild-specific responses to these disturbance agents.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Short-term effects of wildfires on spotted owl survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success
AN  - 230189380
AB  - The effects of wildfire on wildlife are important considerations for resource managers because of recent interest in the role of fire in shaping forested landscapes in the western United States. This is particularly true of wildfire effects on spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) because of the uncertainty of impacts of controlled burning within spotted owl habitat. Therefore, we documented minimum survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success for 21 spotted owls after large (>540 ha) wildfires occurred within 11 owl territories in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. In each territory, fire burned through the nest and primary roost sites. Eighteen owls (86%) were known to be alive at least 1 year after the fires, which was similar to reported annual adult survival probabilities for the species. Of 7 pairs of which both members were later resighted, all were located together on the same territories during the breeding season following fires, and 4 pairs produced a total of 7 fledglings. No pair separations were observed after fire. On 8 territories where fire severities were mapped, 50% experienced predominantly low- to moderate-severity fires while 50% experienced high-severity fires that burned large (>30%) areas of the territories. We hypothesize that wildfires may have little short-term impact on survival, site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success of spotted owls. Further, prescribed burning could be an effective tool in restoring habitat to natural conditions with minimal short-term impact on resident spotted owls. While we do not advocate wholesale prescribed burning in spotted owl territories at this time, we believe our observations justify large-scale experiments on effects of prescribed burning on spotted owls to corroborate our observations and to establish cause-and-effect relationships.

T1  - Use of artificial roosts by forest-dwelling bats in northern Arizona
AN  - 230188374
AB  - Forest-dwelling bats often use snags and live trees as maternity and bachelor roost sites. These roost sites can be destroyed or altered by natural events (e.g., wildfire) or forest management activities (e.g., prescribed fire, thinning, harvesting). To determine whether artificial roost structures could supplement natural roost sites, we tested 2 types of artificial structures for use by bats: resin (n= 10) and wood (n= 10) roosts. Artificial roosts were placed on snags in 6 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands and compared with use of nearby natural roost snags (n= 10). We monitored the 3 roost types (resin, wood, natural) approximately every 2 weeks for use by bats for 2 summers (1999 and 2000). Over the 2-yr period, bats used 17 of 20 artificial roosts (8 resin and 9 wood), using both artificial roost types in about equal proportions. Bats used 5 of the 10 natural snags monitored. Resin roosts were camouflaged to match tree bark, have a >20-year lifespan, and cost US $42 each after construction of a $250 mold. They can be designed to resemble any tree species. Wood roosts cost about $5 each, were more visible, and likely have a shorter lifespan than resin roosts. Both roost types might require some annual maintenance (recaulking tops and edges). Maintaining and managing for natural roosts should be a priority for resource managers since artificial roosts might not provide the same microclimate as natural roosts. However, artificial roosts might be useful temporary habitat under site-specific conditions. Artificial roosts could also be useful as research tools.

T1  - Low genetic variation in a Pacific cycad: conservation concerns for Cycas seemannii (Cycadaceae)
AN  - 222308332
AB  - The conservation status of Cycas seemannii, native to Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga, is assessed based on isozyme analysis, abundance estimates and factors affecting the survival of the species. Genetic variation in the species is low and genetic differentiation between populations is high, as compared to plants in general and to other cycads. Lower genetic variation was detected in a fragmented population as compared to less disturbed populations. Low gene flow was also detected, implying little contact between the various populations. A conservative estimate of 17,000 individuals remaining in the wild was obtained, with more than half of these located on the islands of Vanuatu. Accounts of past abundance suggest declining population sizes, most likely the result of repeated burning. Other factors that may be contributing to the decline are decreasing importance to and protection by humans, habitat alteration for agricultural and developmental purposes, and poor dispersal and recolonisation potential. An assessment based on the present estimated abundance and what is known of recent declines in numbers, indicates that the species should be categorised as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. On some of the densely populated islands, such as Viti Levu in Fiji and Nukualofa in Tonga, the species is locally Endangered or Critically Endangered. Possible conservation measures are suggested, and it is emphasised that populations on different islands must be considered separately because of their genetic differentiation.

T1  - The Use of Biophysical and Expected Payoff Probability Simulation Modeling in the Economic Assessment of Brush Management Alternatives
AN  - 56093975; 0600007
AB  - Woody plant encroachment restricts forage production and capacity to produce grazing livestock. Biophysical plant growth simulation and economic simulation were used to evaluate a prescribed burning range management technique. Modeling systems incorporated management practices and costs, historical climate data, vegetation and soil inventories, livestock production data, and historical regional livestock prices. The process compared baseline non-treatment return estimates to expected change in livestock returns resulting from prescribed burning. Stochastic analyses of production and price variability produced estimates of greater net returns resulting from use of prescribed burning relative to the baseline.

T1  - Landscape changes and breeding bird assemblages in northwestern Portugal: the role of fire
AN  - 738976384
AB  - Fire is a major driving force of landscape change in the Mediterranean region. The objectives of this paper were to explore the implications of landscape change and wildfires in a region of northwestern Portugal for the diversity of breeding birds. Land use cover for the years 1958, 1968, 1983 and 1995 was obtained from aerial photography for a study area of 3700 ha. Breeding bird assemblages in each of six land use categories were characterized in 1998 using point counts. The main landscape changes in the study area across the 40 years were a decrease in the area of agricultural land and low shrublands (respectively 29% and 48%) and an increase in forests and tall shrublands (both over 95%). Bird assemblages showed increased richness and diversity across the gradient: low shrublands [arrow right] tall shrublands [arrow right] conifer [arrow right] mixed [arrow right] deciduous [arrow right] agricultural areas. Many of the species with narrow niche breadth (specialists) were associated with agricultural areas and deciduous forests. In spite of the low diversity of burned areas (mostly shrublands) a few specialist species depend on this habitat. Thus, the current fire regime probably contributes to maintaining bird diversity at the landscape level. There was an inverse relationship between landscape diversity and estimated bird diversity across the last 40 years. Landscape management actions to preserve bird diversity should focus on the maintenance of agricultural land and deciduous forests. In parallel, a wider use of prescribed burning and grazing is suggested. This would contribute to maintaining low shrublands in the landscape, useful both as an habitat for some bird species and as fuel breaks for preventing the occurrence of large wildfires.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Biodiversity Crisis and Adaptation to Climate Change: A Case Study from Australia's Forests
AN  - 751368089
AB  - If current trends continue, human activities will drastically alter most of the planet's remaining natural ecosystems and their composite biota within a few decades. Compounding the impacts on biodiversity from deleterious management practices is climate variability and change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently concluded that there is ample evidence to suggest climate change is likely to result in significant impacts on biological diversity. These impacts are likely to be exacerbated by the secondary effects of climate change such as changes in the occurrence of wildfire, insect outbreaks and similar disturbances. Current changes in climate are very different from those of the past due to their rate and magnitude, the direct effects of increased atmospheric CO^sub 2^ concentrations and because highly modified landscapes and an array of threatening processes limit the ability of terrestrial ecosystems and species to respond to changed conditions. One of the primary human adaptation option for conserving biodiversity is considered to be changes in management. The complex and overarching nature of climate change issues emphasises the need for greatly enhanced cooperation between scientists, policy makers, industry and the community to better understand key interactions and identify options for adaptation. A key challenge is to identify opportunities that facilitate sustainable development by making use of existing technologies and developing policies that enhance the resilience of climate-sensitive sectors. Measures to enhance the resilience of biodiversity must be considered in all of these activities if many ecosystem services essential to humanity are to be sustained. New institutional arrangements appear necessary at the regional and national level to ensure that policy initiatives and research directed at assessing and mitigating the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change are complementary and undertaken strategically and cost-effectively. Policy implementation at the national level to meet responsibilities arising from the UNFCCC (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol) and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity require greater coordination and integration between economic sectors, since many primary drivers of biodiversity loss and vulnerability are influenced at this level. A case study from the Australian continent is used to illustrate several key issues and discuss a basis for reform, including recommendations for facilitating adaptation to climate variability and change.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Regeneration patterns in a Central European dry heathland: effects of burning, sod-cutting and cutting
AN  - 763722756
AB  - Vegetation development in dry heathlands was studied during a six-year period following experimental burning, sod-cutting and cutting in a continental area in the southern part of the Czech Republic (Podyjí National Park). Calluna vulgaris-dominated heathlands in the area were composed of uneven-aged stands and had been unmanaged for several decades. The aim of the study was testing the applicability of Western European management systems to nature conservation in a continental area. Species composition was recorded in 8 permanent plots using 25×25 cm grids, and vegetation recovery following different treatments was analysed. Calluna recovered successfully after burning. Burning dense heathlands, which contained a large amount of woody fuel, resulted in a medium-intensity fire that destroyed moss mats and litter and exposed patches of bare ground to facilitate Calluna regeneration by seed, in addition to vegetative regrowth. On the contrary, in open heathlands with patches of herbaceous vegetation, low-intensity fires which failed to expose mineral soil were more typical. Almost all Calluna regeneration was vegetative in this case, and regrowth was slower. Heathland recovery after sod-cutting to mineral soil depended on whether or not Calluna seed germination occurred in the plot. With germination, the community developed towards heathland; without towards grassland. Cutting promoted a striking increase in grass cover, which was followed by the slow recovery of Calluna. The experiments suggest that of these management systems, burning is perhaps the most appropriate in the study area. A nature conservation management system is proposed, based on sheep grazing combined with rotational burning of restricted patches.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 874203411
AB  - The Cyprus mouflon is an endangered species inhabiting Cyprus' Paphos forest on an area of 620 km^sup 2^. There is only one population of this subspecies in a single reserve which is threatened by habitat degradation, forest fires and diseases transmitted by domestic sheep foraging in the same area as the mouflon. During the last decades, the climate of Cyprus has become warmer and drier. Water has been pumped from Paphos forest for irrigation purposes, draining many artesian springs which were providing water for the mouflon. Lack of water in combination with lack of forage inside the forest is driving the mouflon outside the forest and bringing them into contact with domestic sheep and goats, which might be infected with scrapie and pulmonary adenomatosis. So far, no mouflon were found to be infected with these diseases, but transmission is possible. In July 1998, a fire originating in the agricultural area invaded Paphos forest in three separate places. This paper presents the measures taken to protect the mouflon from water shortages, wildfires and diseases. I also suggest conservation measures.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Seed and seedling of pinon and juniper species in the Pygmy Woodlands of western North America
AN  - 211879714; 04297627
AB  - Knowledge of the seed and seedling ecology of the piñon and juniper woodlands of western North America is essential for understanding both the northward migration and expansion of the woodlands during the Holocene (< 11,500 B.P.), and the accelerated expansion of the woodlands since settlement of the West by Anglo-Americans around 200 years ago. We follow the fates of seeds and seedlings of the different piñon and juniper species within the woodlands from seed development to seedling establishment, and discuss the implications of this information for the past and present expansion of the woodlands. While seed development requires about two and one-half years in pinons, it is species-dependent in junipers and can take one, two, or even three years. Substantial seed losses can occur during seed development due to developmental constraints, and before or after seed maturation as a result of insects, pathogens, or predatory animals. In piñon pines, the primary seed dispersers are scatterhoarding birds (corvids) and rodents that harvest seeds from the trees or after seed fall and cache them in the soil. In contrast, most junipers appear to be dispersed primarily by frugivorous birds and mammals that ingest the seeds and defecate them onto the soil surface. We have recently documented that scatter-hoarding rodents also disperse juniper seeds. Disperser effectiveness, or the contribution a disperser makes to the future reproduction of a plant population, may vary among species of piñons and especially junipers. Piñon seeds are short-lived and exhibit little dormancy, and they probably only germinate the spring following dispersal. Juniper seeds are long-lived and seed dispersal can occur over one or more years. Seed germination can be delayed for several years due to impermeable seed coats, embryo dormancy, or the presence of inhibitors. Seedling establishment of piñon pines is facilitated by nurse plants but, while junipers often establish beneath nurse plants, they are capable of establishing in open environments. In the southwestern United States, higher establishment of juniper occurs in open environments due to more favorable precipitation, and competition may be more important than facilitation in determining establishment.

              
When considering the mechanisms involved in the past and present expansion of the woodlands, short-distance dispersal, local population growth, and long-distance dispersal are all important. Different classes of dispersers, some of which appear to have coevolved with the tree species, appear to be responsible for local (short-distance) vs. long-distance dispersal in pinons and junipers. Because ecotones form the interface between the woodlands and adjacent communities, they can provide valuable information on both the seed dispersal and seedling establishment processes responsible for tree expansion.

              
Disturbance regimes and, recently, the effects of humans on those regimes have major effects on the expansion and contraction of the woodlands. Before Anglo-American settlement, fires occurred as frequently as every 50-100 years throughout much of the woodlands. During this century, fire frequencies have been reduced due to the indirect effects of livestock grazing and the direct effects of removing Native Americans from the ecosystem and implementing active fire-prevention programs. The result has been an increase in tree-dominated successional stages at the expense of grass-dominated stages. Various management techniques, including controlled burning and chaining, have been implemented to reduce tree dominance, but their effects depend largely on the life histories of the tree species and the disturbance characteristics. Several areas relating to the seed and seedling ecology of the piñon and juniper require additional research if we are to truly understand the dynamics of the woodlands.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Influence of thinning and burning restoration treatments on presettlement ponderosa pines at the Gus Pearson Natural Area
AN  - 230519877
AB  - Abstract: This study assessed the effects of restoration treatments on growth, leaf physiology, and insect resistance characteristics of presettlement-age ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Gus Pearson Natural Area in northern Arizona. Treatments (C, control; T, thinned from below; TB, thinned and prescribed burned) were designed to restore stand structure and disturbance regime to a pre-Euro-American settlement reference condition. Tree growth and some physiological characteristics differed between wet (1995) and dry (1996) years. Soil water content was greater in both thinned treatments than in the control. Compared with the control, trees in both thinned treatments had greater leaf nitrogen content (C = 1.44, T = 1.57, TB = 1.59 gm-2), leaf toughness (C = 65.1, T = 71.3, TB = 69.3 g), and basal area increment (C = 14.3, T = 19.9, TB = 20.7 cm2). Resin flow was greater in the thinned and burned treatment (12.2 mL-day-1) than in the thinned treatment (4.3 mL.day-) and control (3.6 mL.day-1). Treatment differences in predawn water potential and net photosynthetic rate varied among sample dates, with the largest differences during a period of drought (C < T and TB). Our results suggest that restoration treatments improved resource uptake, growth, and insect resistance capabilities of presettlement ponderosa pines.               In 1993, restoration treatments were applied to a portion of the GPNA. These treatments were designed to simulate the stand structure and fire disturbance regime that was present before Euro-American settlement. The rationale for these treatments is that ponderosa pine forests should be healthier growing under conditions that simulate their long-term evolutionary environment (i.e., low stand density and a frequent, low-intensity fire regime). In this paper, we compare growth, leaf physiological attributes, and characteristics of resistance to pine bark beetles and pine sawflies of presettlement trees among the control, thinned, and thinned and burned treatments over the initial 2 years following treatment. We predicted greater uptake of carbon, water, and nutrients and greater growth of presettlement trees in both thinned treatments versus the control resulting from reduced tree-to-tree competition for soil resources following thinning. We also predicted greater uptake of carbon and nutrients and greater growth of presettlement trees in the thinned and burned treatment versus the thinned treatment due to expected increases in plant-available nitrogen following burning. Finally, we predicted that trees in both thinned treatments would have greater resin flow, thicker phloem, and tougher leaves than in the control because of a greater availability of resources to support resin synthesis and leaf development.               There are several possible explanations for the increase in BAI of presettlement trees in the thinned treatments compared with the control. Leaf A of trees in the thinned treatments averaged 5% higher than in the control, suggesting that more photosynthate was available for growth in the thinned treatments. Further, treatment differences in A were most pronounced during the periods of the year with severe drought (mid-May to mid-June of 1996), when PWP was the lowest and differences in PWP between the thinned treatments and the control were largest. Lower PWP and A of presettlement trees in the control versus the thinned treatments during this droughty period provides a physiological explanation for the greater decrease in BAI between 1995 and 1996 for trees in the control. Of the physiological variables that were significantly correlated with A (gs, PWP, MWP, NTarea), only PWP and NTarea differed significantly between the thinned treatments and the control, suggesting an influence of low PWP and NTarea in limiting A of trees in the control. The lack of a significant difference in Ci and gs between the thinned treatments and the control suggests nonstomatal limitations to A of trees in the control, such as by enzymatic constraints associated with low leaf NTarea.

T1  - Conservation of the Noisy Scrub-bird: a review of 35 years of research and management
AN  - 862944205
AB  - The Noisy Scrub-bird is a small, semi-flightless insectivore which forages in leaf litter and the lower stratum of dense vegetation. More widespread when discovered last century the species declined rapidly after European settlement of Western Australia due to habitat clearing and large scale, uncontrolled wildfires. A small, remnant population survived in dense low forest and thickets on Mt Gardner at Two Peoples Bay. Exclusion of fire from scrub-bird habitat allowed the population at Two Peoples Bay to increase through natural breeding. Translocations to new sites, where successful, have provided more habitat for the scrub-bird resulting in seven sub-populations in the area between Oyster Harbour and Cheyne Beach east of Albany. Rapid increases in numbers have occurred in the Mt Manypeaks area in recent years. The whole population has now increased to 10.5 times its size at rediscovery. This paper reviews Noisy Scrub-bird conservation efforts during the 35 years since its rediscovery and focuses on recent progress, population trends, and the current status of the species. Successful conservation management has been based on research into the scrub-bird's biology and ecology and has involved habitat reservation and protection, fire management, population monitoring, and translocation. Scrub-bird conservation has also provided benefits for other threatened species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of winter burning on birds in mesquite grassland
AN  - 230182018; 04342488
AB  - The effects of prescribed burns in winter on the relative abundance and species richness of breeding and wintering birds in mesquite grassland at the Welder Wildlife Foundation Refuge in Texas from Jun 1995 to Aug 1996 were investigated.  Maintaining unburned areas adjacent to burns to provide habitat for bird species that declined after winter prescribed burning is recommended.

T1  - The decline, response to fire, status and management of the Eastern Bristlebird
AN  - 862945283
AB  - The Eastern Bristlebird Dasyornis brachypterus is a threatened passerine, endemic to southeastern Australia. It is a cryptic, ground dwelling, semi-flightless inhabitant of dense, fire-prone vegetation and is usually only detected by its calls. The disjunct distribution suggests that they were once more numerous and their population continuous from southern Queensland to western Victoria. Their decline has been documented in historic and recent times. Habitat loss, nest desertion and fire have been implicated in the decline and extinction of local populations. Strongholds for the species are Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Bherwerre Peninsula, 100 and 150 km south of Sydney respectively. At Barren Grounds, in the absence of recent fire, there were significant increases in the population between 1992 and 1996. There was a trend of increasing Eastern Bristlebird density with increasing fire-age of habitat and average density plateauing at two birds per 5 ha, 10 years after fire. At Nadgee, a coastal Nature Reserve on the New South Wales/Victorian border, the population appears to be recovering very slowly from severe wildfires in 1972 and 1980. At the beginning of 1996 there were less than 2 000 individual Eastern Bristlebirds occupying an area of approximately 100 km^sup 2^. For the management of Eastern Bristlebirds, habitat manipulation using prescribed fire should not be undertaken unless site-specific population monitoring data demonstrate that it would be beneficial. Concentrations of Eastern Bristlebirds and potential fire refuges should be protected from unplanned fire. For prescription burns, potential escape routes need to be planned for Eastern Bristlebirds. The threatened status should be changed from Vulnerable to Endangered. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Dead trees left in clear-cuts benefit saproxylic Coleoptera adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest
AN  - 863397237
AB  - Forest management alters the pattern of forest dynamics from that in natural conditions in the boreal region. In order to examine how certain forestry measures matching natural dynamics affect forest insects, we compared assemblages of saproxylic Coleoptera on dead, standing birch trunks left behind in eight clear-cut areas with corresponding assemblages in seven mature forests in southern and eastern Finland. We used trunk-window traps for sampling. Distinct beetle assemblages were associated with the different habitats. Median numbers of species or specimens caught did not differ between closed forests and clear-cuts, but individual beetle species occurred unevenly among the habitats. Several beetle species associated with open forest habitat, e.g. burned forests or storm-damage areas, including species regarded as threatened in Finland, were found almost exclusively, in clear-cuts. Correspondingly, a number of beetle species occurring frequently in closed forests were not found in clear-cuts. We conclude that dead trunks left in the clear-cut areas may host not only generalist saproxylic species but also many beetle species specialized to warm, sun-exposed environments, and such species may not be able to survive in closed forests. Management measures matching suppressed natural disturbances are found useful in preserving diversity in managed forests.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
