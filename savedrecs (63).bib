Abstract = {{1. Mitigating the impacts of large-scale fires on biodiversity is
   becoming increasingly important as their frequency increases. In
   response, fire managers have engaged with the concept that retaining
   small unburnt residual areas of vegetation within extensively burnt
   landscapes may facilitate biodiversity conservation. However, it remains
   uncertain how the size and isolation of these unburnt residuals
   influence faunal distributions, persistence and recovery following fire.
   2. We used a replicated observation study to test bird responses to the
   size and isolation of unburnt residuals in a mallee woodland area
   recently burnt by a 28 000 ha wildfire in southern Australia. The scale
   of our study provided a rare opportunity to consider the responses of
   large mobile organisms to fire-induced habitat fragmentation. Within
   five replicated spatial blocks, we crossed two levels of isolation with
   large (5-7 ha) and small (1-3 ha) unburnt patches and matrix sites burnt
   5 years previously. We compared these site types to six continuous
   (non-fragmented) unburnt sites. We surveyed each site on eight
   occasions.
   3. Most birds occurred more frequently in unburnt habitat beyond the
   extent of the fire. Bird responses to the availability and spatial
   distribution of unburnt remnants within the fire were largely influenced
   by their ability to use the recently burnt matrix. Occurrence of five
   species was higher in unburnt residuals when more of the landscape
   within 500 m was burnt.
   4. A fire refuge effect may be likely for two competitive species that
   occurred more frequently in unburnt residuals than in the burnt matrix
   or continuous unburnt habitat. For the weebill, recolonization following
   fire was likely to occur gradually over time from ex situ sources.
   5. Synthesis and applications. To maintain avian diversity in fire-prone
   landscapes, our results suggest a need to shift management focus from
   creating networks of small unburnt patches towards preserving large,
   intact areas of habitat. However, five species common to the burnt
   matrix preferentially selected residual patches when unburnt resources
   were locally scarce. Therefore, to benefit birds, land managers should
   limit the extent of applied burns and use narrow burns. When planning
   large burns, practitioners should consider that a number of species will
   remain absent from the landscape for several decades.}},

Abstract = {{Verticordia fimbrilepis (Turcz) ssp. fimbrilepis (Myrtaceae) is an
   endangered shrub that occurs in a number of populations varying in size
   and landscape context. We compared the importance of factors associated
   with its reproductive biology with that of factors influencing the
   regeneration niche in survival of small, isolated populations in
   contrasting habitat fragments. Small populations on road verges had
   equal or greater diversity of insect visitors to flowers, rates of
   pollination, and seed production compared with larger populations in
   conservation reserves. V. fimbrilepis seeds remained dormant in the soil
   for at least 30 months, and germination was stimulated by smoke. Plants
   were killed by fire, but mass recruitment from soil-stored seed reserves
   occurred in the first and second winters following fire. Our studies
   showed some seedling recruitment between fires, but this was strongly
   related to the availability of competition-free establishment sites.
   Whether this is enough to replace older plants as they die and thereby
   sustain stable populations is unknown and probably varies with the
   landscape. Environmental variation between fire episodes influenced
   population size. Drought increased mortality, but wetter years
   encouraged interfire recruitment. Most populations are declining and
   cannot recover without the occurrence of fire. In a fragmented
   agricultural landscape, fire suppression is the primary management
   practice. This may adversely affect rare species such as V. fimbrilepis
   and others with similar life histories that rely on a particular fire
   regime to persist. Population persistence is more likely to be related
   to stochastic environmental events than to factors associated with
   reproductive biology.}},

   ecosystems have been altered by livestock grazing, fire suppression, and
   other land management techniques resulting in ecological changes in
   these areas. Increases in abundance of woody vegetation may be causing
   declines in native herbaceous understory species. We examined the
   effects of prescribed fire on the morphology, abundance, and phenology
   of nine abundant forb (herbaceous dicot) species used selectively by
   Centrocercus urophasianus (Sage Grouse). In September 1997 prescribed
   fire was applied to four of eight randomly assigned 400-ha A.t.
   wyomingensis (Wyoming big sagebrush) study plots at Hart Mountain
   National Antelope Refuge, Oregon. Livestock had not grazed experimental
   plots since 1991. Burning caused morphological changes such as
   significantly greater numbers of racemes and flowers per raceme in
   Astragalus malachus (shaggy milkvetch-Legumoideae) (9 in burn vs. 6 in
   control; 23 in burn vs. 21 in control, respectively). Also, prescribed
   burning caused greater numbers of flowers in Phlox gracilis
   (microsteris-Polemoniaceae) (57 vs. 13), greater numbers of umbels and
   umbelletts in Lomatium nevadense (Nevada desert parsley-Umbellifereae)
   (4 vs. 2 and 59 vs. 31, respectively), greater numbers of flower heads
   in Crepis modocensis (Modoc hawksbeard-Compositae) (32 vs. 21), and
   greater number of flowers/cm(3) in Phlox longifolia (longleaf
   phlox-Polemoniaceae) (0.11 vs. 0.06). Crown volume of Crepis modocensis
   (7,085 vs. 4,179 cm(3) ) and Astragalus malachus (2,854 vs. 1,761 cm(3)
   ) plants was greater in burned plots than control plots. However,
   burning resulted in a smaller crown area of Antennaria dimorpha (low
   pussytoes-Compositae) (20 vs. 37 cm(2) ). Phenology and time of
   flowering were also affected by fire. The period of active growth for
   each species was extended later into the summer in burned plots
   (p<0.01). In addition, Crepis modocensis and Lomatium nevadense flowered
   12 to 14 days earlier in burned plots. Fire had no effect on frequency,
   density, and relative abundance of seven of the nine studied species.
   Fire reduced the frequency and relative abundance of A. dimorpha and
   Phlox longifolia and reduced the density of A. dimorpha .}},

   an opportunity to study short-term effects of wildfire on white-tailed

   deer between 7 April and 20 June 2008 and recorded dressed body weight,
   body condition, number of corpora lutea, and number and size of fetuses.
   We used rumen contents to quantify forage classes consumed. Deer ate
   prickly pear (Opuntia engelmannii) pads and emergent grasses during
   April and shifted to forbs and browse as vegetation communities
   recovered. Deer consumed mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) beans and
   prickly pear fruit during mid-June. Body condition measures did not vary
   during the collection period, suggesting deer were able to acquire
   sufficient nutrients to meet requirements. Fetal development rate
   appeared normal. Precipitation (11.4 cm) during late April and May

Title = {{Does post-disturbance salvage logging affect the provision of ecosystem
   services? A systematic review protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Forest fires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are common
   forest disturbances that are expected to increase in importance in
   coming decades. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage
   logging, i.e. the felling and removal of the affected trees. However,
   harvesting these biological legacies may represent a second disturbance
   whose effects on ecosystem processes add on those of the initial
   disturbance. Many of the potentially affected processes, such as soil
   erosion and stream water quality, represent regulating and supporting
   ecosystem services important for human society. In the last 15 years,
   much empirical evidence has been gathered on the ecological consequences
   of this management practice, and it has now become necessary to
   synthesise this evidence in meaningful ways for managers and
   decision-makers.
   Methods: With this systematic review we aim to synthesise the literature
   on the effects of salvage logging on ecosystem services and determine
   the effects of major effect modifiers such as disturbance type and
   intensity, the timing and method of logging, and the type of forest. We
   will conduct searches of the primary scientific literature, which will
   be selected and categorised according to its relevance to the topic and
   its quality. Each relevant article will be read in full to obtain the
   necessary data for meta-analysis and to identify its main conclusions.
   Mixed-effects models will be performed to assess the effects of the
   identified effect modifiers on the effect sizes of the salvage
   intervention on ecosystem services and to account for random effects
   arising from studies being performed in the same area. Sensitivity
   analyses will test the potential effects of study quality, and
   publication bias will be assessed with the trim and fill method. We will
   present the results as a narrative review and a meta-analysis.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Abstract = {{An analysis of mark-recapture data for Rattus tunneyi in Kakadu National
   Park from a seven-year period was performed. Capture rates declined
   500-fold during this period. The species exhibits a strong preference
   for riparian vegetation. The diet is primarily herbivorous, with little
   insect material. High-nutrient plant parts are generally chosen.
   Reproduction is most common in the wet season but some breeding extends
   throughout the year if unseasonal rain occurs during the dry season.
   Fire regime seems to have little effect on population numbers. The level
   of groundwater irrigating the riparian system and to a lesser extent
   current rainfall have a much stronger influence. Museum records show a
   contraction since European colonisation from a near-total continental
   distribution to one-seventh of its former distribution along the
   north-west Australian and southern Queensland coast. The contraction
   from the more-arid regions is likely to be due to the impact of
   introduced mammalian herbivores on the riparian habitats which
   previously functioned as refuge areas during periods of low water
   availability. Historically, R. tunneyi is likely to have fluctuated in
   distribution and abundance throughout the continent. In recent times,
   this has included irruptions into commercial crops in some areas. The
   loss of local refuges plus relatively poor powers of dispersal have
   resulted in the distribution now being fragmented, with the
   north-western and central east coasts of Australia providing the most
   significant habitat for the species.}},

Abstract = {{Forest areas restored after mining typically take decades, or longer,
   before they resemble the original vegetation community. Understanding
   how fauna succession varies with plant succession requires detailed
   knowledge of an animal's ecology. Knowledge of an animal's ecology can
   also be used to predict faunal responses to management manipulations and
   enable techniques to be developed that accelerate the return of fauna to
   restored sites. We radio-tracked western bearded dragons (Pogona minor)
   in a mix of unmined forest sites and sites restored after bauxite
   mining, in the jarrah forest of south-west Western Australia, to
   determine critical resources and important microhabitats for dragons.
   Dragons were generalists - utilising a range of microhabitats - and
   adaptable, adjusting their microhabitat use depending on availability.
   Individuals also differed significantly in their microhabitat use and
   did not appear to have a defined home range. We concluded that the
   species would rapidly recolonise restored sites and that no
   modifications to current restoration practices were required to
   accelerate their return. Prescribed burning of restored areas could
   negatively affect this species but the effect would be short-term (< 2
   years). The approach used in this study could be used to develop
   management prescriptions that accelerate the return of late-successional
   species to restored sites.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance by anthropogenic activities may cause chronic (long-term)
   stress in wildlife and contribute to population declines. Although
   declines of boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) across
   Canada have been attributed to anthropogenic disturbance, the
   physiological stress response of caribou to disturbance is not well
   understood. As a measure of chronic stress, we assessed cortisol
   concentrations in guard hair from 89 female caribou between 2009 and
   2011 in eastern Manitoba. We compared cortisol concentrations among 5
   caribou populations occupying areas with varying levels of disturbance,
   and estimated home ranges of 55 collared caribou to examine how home
   range size varied with cortisol concentrations. Within each home range,
   we quantified disturbance characteristics (roads, transmission lines,
   cottages, and logged and burned areas) and landscape features (lakes,
   black spruce {[}Picea mariana], and jack pine {[}Pinus banksiana]), and
   used model selection to determine the combination of disturbance
   features that best explained variation in caribou cortisol
   concentrations. Hair cortisol concentrations differed among the 5
   caribou populations and increased with decreasing home range size. The
   proportion of the home range logged in the previous 6-21 years best
   explained variation in cortisol concentrations. Our results suggest that
   caribou respond negatively to logging, and caribou occupying the
   southern extent of their range could be vulnerable to disturbance.
   Although disturbance affects caribou cortisol concentrations, the
   consequences of increased cortisol concentrations on caribou survival
   and reproduction are unknown and need to be examined for effective
   management of populations. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.
   We evaluated the effects of disturbance on chronic levels of cortisol in
   boreal woodland caribou, and found that cortisol levels increased with
   increasing logging disturbance and decreasing home ranges. Minimizing
   logging and other anthropogenic disturbance, particularly from the
   southern extent of the caribou's range, could reduce cortisol levels in
   caribou.}},

Abstract = {{Beef cattle production from rangelands in the Southern Great Plains has

   integrated restoration strategies involving prescribed fire and grazing
   management. Restoration strategies tested in this year-round grazing
   ecosystem were 4-pasture, 1-herd rotation with fire (25\% of pasture
   acreage burned each year; 4:1F); an 8-pasture, 1-herd rotation, with

   applied during late winter. Beef cattle (cow calf) production variables
   measured included conception rate, weaned calf percentage, weaning
   weight, weight of calf per exposed cow, weight of calf per hectare, and
   supplement fed per cow. We observed significant differences in beef
   production among strategies primarily during the first 2 yr where the

   production than the integrated restoration strategies. Differences in
   livestock production among strategies were minimal over the last 5 yr of

Abstract = {{Grassland bird populations in North America continue to decline

   in habitat preference and survival in subirrigated meadows of the
   Nebraska Sandhills, one of North America's largest contiguous grassland
   systems. Our research indicates that habitat preference varied with
   fledgling age and ambient temperature: at higher ambient temperatures,
   fledglings tended to select sites with deeper litter and shorter
   vegetation, while younger, mostly flightless fledglings tended to select
   sites with shallower litter and taller vegetation. We confirmed 23
   fatalities, including 8 (35\%) from predators, 2 (9\%) from haying

   bullsnakes (Pituophis catenifer sayi). The probability of daily survival
   (0.981) was high compared to estimates for passerine fledglings in other

   burning can decrease litter depth and associated abundance of snakes in
   grasslands, but neither are likely conservation strategies in
   subirrigated meadows of the Nebraska Sandhills, because hay production
   provides winter feed for cattle. We recommend maintaining mid to late
   summer hay harvest so first cohorts of nestlings can fledge, attain

Title = {{Success of Seeding Native Compared with Introduced Perennial Vegetation
   for Revegetating Medusahead-Invaded Sagebrush Rangeland}},

Abstract = {{Millions of hectares of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata
   Nutt. subsp. wyomingensis Beetle\&Young) rangeland have been invaded by
   medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae {[}L] Nevski), an exotic annual
   grass that degrades wildlife habitat, reduces forage production, and
   decreases biodiversity. Revegetation of medusahead-invaded sagebrush
   plant communities is necessary to restore ecosystem services.
   Disagreement, however, exists over whether to seed native or introduced
   perennial species to revegetate communities after controlling
   medusahead. Though native species generally do not establish as well as
   introduced species, interference from co-seeded introduced species has
   often been attributed to the limited success of natives. The potential
   for seeding natives to revegetate communities after medusahead control
   is relatively unknown because they have been largely co-seeded with
   introduced species. We compared the results of seeding native and
   introduced perennial species after controlling medusahead with
   prescribed burning followed with an imazapic herbicide application at
   five sites. Perennial bunchgrass cover and density were 5- and 10-fold
   greater in areas seeded with introduced compared with native species 3
   years post seeding. Furthermore, exotic annual grass cover and density
   were less in areas seeded with introduced compared with native species.
   Seeded introduced and native shrubs largely failed to establish. High
   perennial bunchgrass density (15 individuals . m(-2)) in areas seeded
   with introduced species in the third year post seeding suggests that the
   succession trajectory of these communities has shifted to becoming
   perennial dominated. Average perennial bunchgrass density of 1.5
   individuals . m(-2) with seeding native species will likely not limit
   medusahead and appears to already be converting back to exotic annual
   grass-dominated communities. These results suggest that seeding
   introduced compared with native species after medusahead control will
   likely be more successful. Our results also imply that if natives are
   selected to seed after medusahead control, additional resources may be
   necessary to recontrol medusahead and repeatedly sow native species.

Abstract = {{A substantial proportion of the primary productivity in grassland
   ecosystems is allocated belowground, sustaining an abundant and diverse
   community of microbes and soil invertebrates. These belowground
   communities drive many important ecosystem functions and are responsive
   to a variety of environmental changes. Nematodes, an abundant and
   diverse component of grassland soil communities, are particularly
   responsive to altered environmental conditions, such as those associated
   with reduced fire frequency and nitrogen enrichment, with the most
   consistent responses displayed by microbial-feeding nematodes. However,
   much of the available research characterizing nematode responses to
   environmental change has been carried out at the taxonomic level of
   family or by broad trophic categories (e.g. fungivores, bacterivores).
   The extent to which differential responses to environmental change
   occurs at the genus level or below is unclear. Therefore, the objective
   of this study was to use molecular methods to quantify the response of
   microbial-feeding nematodes, at the lowest levels of taxonomic
   resolution, to nitrogen enrichment and changes in fire frequency. Using
   sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes for
   the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and the ITS1 region, we identified 19
   microbial-feeding nematode taxa across four families. When nematodes
   were sampled across treatments, we found that some nematode taxa within
   a family responded similarly to nitrogen and burning treatments, while
   other taxa within the same family respond quite differently.
   Additionally, although nematodes from different families on average
   responded differently to nitrogen enrichment and burning, similar
   responses were seen in nematode taxa that span three taxonomic families.
   Thus, if nematodes are to be used as indicators of environmental change,
   care should be taken to assess the response at the lowest taxonomic
   level possible.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) is a species of
   conservation concern in much of its range and has experienced a decline
   since the early to mid-1990s. But the subspecies that inhabits
   peninsular Florida, the Florida spotted skunk (S. p. ambarvalis), might
   still be abundant and is an important nest predator of the endangered
   Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum floridanus). To gain
   insight on this little-studied subspecies and inform potential
   management strategies, we conducted a resource selection study on the
   Florida spotted skunk. We examined 5 hypotheses for den site selection
   related to den type, vegetation, and landscape characteristics in a dry
   prairie ecosystem in central Florida. We tracked 36 individual skunks to
   757 den sites. Using discrete choice analysis, we found that male and
   nonbreeding female skunks at our study site were 5 times more likely to
   select a mammal burrow over a gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus)
   burrow, that selection of a den site increased 34\% for each 1-burrow
   increase in the number of nearby burrows, and that selection of a den
   site increased 3\% for every 10-cm increase in a visual obstruction
   index. Similarly, breeding female skunks were more likely to select
   mammal burrows and shallow depressions over gopher tortoise burrows by
   16-fold and 13-fold, respectively, and selection of a den site increased
   by 75\% for every 1-burrow increase in the number of nearby burrows. In
   contrast to previous studies that occurred in forested, mountainous
   environments elsewhere in the species' range, our findings suggest that
   den characteristics might be more important than landscape or vegetation
   characteristics to Florida spotted skunk den site selection in dry
   prairie. Additionally, the frequency of prescribed fires on the
   landscape did not appear to affect Florida spotted skunk den site
   selection. Thus, Florida spotted skunks in this ecosystem might be
   landscape generalists, thereby potentially limiting the ability of
   managers to control nest predation by this subspecies through habitat
   management. (c) 2019 The Wildlife Society.}},

Title = {{Population Dynamics of Spotted Owls in the Sierra Nevada, California}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Number = {{174}},
Pages = {{1-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) is the only
   spotted owl subspecies not listed as threatened or endangered under the
   United States Endangered Species Act despite petitions to list it as
   threatened. We conducted a meta-analysis of population data for 4
   populations in the southern Cascades and Sierra Nevada, California, USA,
   from 1990 to 2005 to assist a listing evaluation by the United States
   Fish and Wildlife Service. Our study areas (from N to S) were on the
   Lassen National Forest (LAS), Eldorado National Forest (ELD), Sierra
   National Forest (SIE), and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks
   (SKC). These study areas represented a broad spectrum of habitat and
   management conditions in these mountain ranges.
   We estimated apparent survival probability, reproductive output, and
   rate of population change for spotted owls on individual study areas and
   for all study areas combined (meta-analysis) using model selection or
   model-averaging based on maximum-likelihood estimation. We followed a
   formal protocol to conduct this analysis that was similar to other
   spotted owl meta-analyses. Consistency of field and analytical methods
   among our studies reduced confounding methodological effects when
   evaluating results. We used 991 marked spotted owls in the analysis of
   apparent survival. Apparent survival probability was higher for adult
   than for subadult owls. There was little difference in apparent survival
   between male and female owls. Model-averaged mean estimates of apparent
   survival probability of adult owls varied from 0.811 +/- 0.021 for
   females at LAS to 0.890 +/- 0.016 for males at SKC. Apparent survival
   increased over time for owls of all age classes at LAS and SIE, for
   adults at ELD, and for second-year subadults and adults at SKC. The
   meta-analysis of apparent survival, which included only adult owls,
   confirmed an increasing trend in survival over time. Survival rates were
   higher for owls on SKC than on the other study areas.
   We analyzed data from 1,865 observations of reproductive outcomes for
   female spotted owls. The proportion of subadult females among all
   territorial females of known age ranged from 0.00 to 0.25 among study
   areas and years. The proportion of subadults among female spotted owls
   was negatively related to reproductive output (no. of young
   fledged/territorial F owl) for ELD and SIE. Eldorado study area and LAS
   showed an alternate-year trend in reproductive output, with higher
   output in even-numbered years. Mean annual reproductive output was 0.988
   +/- 0.154 for ELD, 0.624 +/- 0.140 for LAS, 0.478 +/- 0.106 for SIE, and
   0.555 +/- 0.110 for SKC. Eldorado Study Area exhibited a declining trend
   and the greatest variation in reproductive output over time, whereas SIE
   and SKC, which had the lowest reproductive output, had the lowest
   temporal variation. Meta-analysis confirmed that reproductive output
   varied among study areas. Reproductive output was highest for adults,
   followed by second-year subadults, and then by first-year subadults.
   We used 842 marked subadult and adult owls to estimate population rate
   of change. Modeling indicated that lambda(t) (lambda(t) is the finite
   rate of population change estimated using the reparameterized
   Jolly-Seber estimator {[}Pradel 1996]) was either stationary (LAS and
   SIE) or increasing after an initial decrease (ELD and SKC). Mean
   estimated lt for the 4 study areas was 1.007 (95\% CI 5 0.952-1.066) for
   ELD; 0.973 (95\% CI 5 0.946-1.001) for LAS; 0.992 (95\% CI 5
   0.966-1.018) for SIE; and 1.006 (95\% CI 5 0.947-1.068) for SKC. The
   best meta-analysis model of population trend indicated that l varied
   across time but was similar in trend among the study areas. Our
   estimates of realized population change (Delta Franklin et al. 2004),
   which we estimated as the product 1 x (lambda) over cap (3) x (lambda)
   over cap (1) x ... x (lambda) over cap (k-1), were based on estimates of
   lambda(t) from individual study areas and did not require estimating
   annual population size for each study area. Trends represented the
   proportion of the population size in the first year that remained in
   each subsequent year. Similar to (lambda) over cap (t) on which they
   were based, these (Delta) over cap (t) showed evidence of decline over
   the study period for LAS and SIE. The best model indicated recruitment
   of male and female adult and subadults varied from 0.10 to 0.31 new
   territorial individuals at time t/number of territorial individuals at
   time t - 1 and similarly among areas. We also conducted a population
   viability analysis (PVA) based on results of our meta-analysis. This PVA
   was of limited utility for ELD and SKC study areas because 95\%
   confidence intervals on the probability of decline or increase spanned
   the interval {[}0, 1] within 5-10 years. When we restricted inferences
   to 7 years, estimated probability of a >10\% decline for SIE was 0.41
   (95\% CI 5 0.09-0.78); for LAS the probability was 0.64 (95\% CI 5
   0.27-0.94). In contrast, estimated probability of a >10\% increase in 7
   years for SIE was 0.23 (95\% CI 5 0.01-0.55) and for LAS was 0.10 (95\%
   CI 5 0.00-0.34). For comparisons, we simulated a PVA for a hypothetical
   population with mean lambda = 1.0 and the same temporal variation as
   observed in our owl populations. Our PVA suggested that both the SIE and
   LAS populations had higher probabilities of declining in a 7-year period
   than increasing but that it would be difficult to determine if a
   population was in a slight gradual decline. Our analysis and the
   repository of information on our 4 study populations provide a data-rich
   template for managers to monitor impacts of future management actions on
   the owl. Specifically, our data can be used to evaluate the effect of
   management strategies on spotted owls that are being implemented by the
   United States Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildfire in the
   Sierra Nevada ecosystem. Our information also provides baseline
   information for evaluating the status of the owl for potential listing
   as a threatened species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.}},

Abstract = {{Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of

   4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and
   forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina)
   populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia.
   We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent
   annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry: and mist
   netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25);
   wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked
   male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly
   survival was 0.981 +/- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +/-
   0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579
   (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or
   juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult
   survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable
   uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term
   monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth
   increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95\% CI
   before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda
   declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found. no evidence

Volume = {{311}},

Abstract = {{The number of threatened species continues to increase due to a range of
   anthropogenic disturbances, and many species continue to decline
   increasing their risk of extinction. Translocation is a widely used
   management technique to establish new populations to reduce the risk of
   extinction. There are, however, a range of issues to be considered. For
   example, for some species the donor population may be impacted by
   translocation, for other species it must be decided whether to
   translocate adults or juveniles to establish new populations. The
   question then becomes who do you move? The endangered Macquarie perch in
   south-eastern Australia is continuing to decline, with the recent
   Millennium Drought (1997-2010) and associated events (e.g., bushfires)
   contributing to dramatic local declines and the need for emergency
   responses. Successful historic translocations of this species involved
   adult fish, however the removal of significant numbers of adult fish may
   now impact source populations and alternative translocation approaches
   needed investigating. The use of sub-adult or juvenile fish, that would
   be expected to experience higher mortality, may be an approach to
   establishing new populations which would have less severe impacts on
   source populations. However, the number of fish required, frequency of
   translocation and likelihood of population establishment are unknown.
   This study outlines the development of a population model to assist in
   trialling translocation scenarios for establishing new populations of
   Macquarie perch. The model predicts that translocations of young-of-year
   fish (age 0+) is unlikely to be successful unless similar to 600 females
   are released annually for five years. If translocating yearling (age 1+)
   fish, annual translocations of >100 females is required to achieve
   success, with stocking for at least five consecutive years required. If
   the frequency of recruitment failure or magnitude of Allee effects
   increases, then translocations of increased numbers of yearlings or
   prolonged stocking (10 years) is required to achieve success. The
   addition of small numbers of adult fish in combination with yearlings
   decreases the number of yearlings required, and increases the chance of
   success under more stressful scenarios. Crown Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background
   Thought to be endemic to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Ruehssia
   woodburyana (Apocynaceae) was recently discovered at a single location

   meta-population is very limited with a total of 37 individuals known in
   the wild. The largest subpopulation, on Mona Island, has only 26
   individuals. The species suitable habitat is experiencing a continuing
   decline due to urban development, grazing by feral ungulates and
   human-induced forest fires. Conservation action is urgently needed and
   should be directed towards establishing genetically representative ex
   situ collections, such as seed for long term storage and live material
   for propagation. This species is evaluated as Critically Endangered
   (CR), based on Criteria C2a(i)+D, according to the IUCN Red List

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Two factors that can degrade native plant community composition and
   structure, and hinder restoration efforts, are invasive species and
   chronic overbrowsing by ungulates such as white-tailed deer. Beginning
   in 2007, the effectiveness, costs, and impacts of Japanese barberry
   control treatments and herbivory on nonnative and native plant
   communities was examined at eight study areas over 4 to 5 yr. Prescribed
   burning and mechanical mowing by wood shredder or brush saw were
   utilized as initial treatments to reduce the aboveground portion of
   established barberry and were equally effective. Without a follow-up
   treatment, barberry had recovered to 56 to 81\% of pretreatment levels
   50 to 62 mo after initial treatment. Follow-up treatments in mid-summer
   to kill new sprouts included directed heating and foliar herbicide
   applications. Relative to untreated controls, follow-up treatments
   lowered barberry cover 50 to 62 mo after initial treatment by at least
   72\%. Although all follow-up treatments were equally effective, the
   labor cost of directed heating was four times higher than for herbicide
   applications. Follow-up treatment type (directed heating vs. herbicide)
   had minimal impact on species other than barberry. White-tailed deer
   herbivory had a larger impact on other species than did barberry control
   treatments. Native grass and fern cover was higher outside of
   exclosures. Areas inside exclosures had higher cover of Oriental
   bittersweet and multiflora rose, but not Japanese barberry. Thus,
   recovery of native communities will require more than simply removing
   the dominant invasive species where deer densities are high. Excellent
   reduction of Japanese barberry cover can be achieved using either
   directed heating or herbicides as follow-up treatments in a two-step
   process, but other invasive plants may become a problem when barberry is
   removed if deer populations are low.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-proxy analyses from floodplain deposits in the Colne Valley,

   open cool environment to fully developed heterogeneous floodplain
   vegetation during the Early Mesolithic. Several distinct phases of
   burning are shown to have occurred that are chronologically contemporary
   with the local archaeological record. The floodplain itself is shown to
   have supported a number of rare Urwaldrelikt insect species implying
   human manipulation of the floodplain at this time must have been limited
   or episodic. By the Late Mesolithic a reed-sedge swamp had developed
   across much of the floodplain, within which repeated burning of the in
   situ vegetation took place. This indicates deliberate land management
   practices utilising fire, comparable with findings from other floodplain
   sequences in southern Britain. With similar sedimentary sequences known

Abstract = {{Throughout northern Arizona, USA, forest thinning in ponderosa pine
   (Pinus ponderosa) forests has become a common practice to reduce the
   threat of stand-replacing wildfire and to increase plant and animal
   diversity across the landscape. To determine how thinning affects
   predator occurrence, we assessed relationships between predator
   occupancy and the density of small mammals (prey) across a range of tree
   stocking levels (basal area of 10-65 m(2)/ha). Predators were detected
   using 2 techniques: baited track plates and motion-sensitive cameras. We
   sampled 33 sites for 2 weeks each in order to detect presence of
   predators, and estimated occupancy using occupancy models and multimodel
   inference. We modeled occupancy rates for gray fox (Urocyon
   cinereoargenteus), coyote (Canis latrans), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
   Our results suggest that thinning may have a positive influence on gray
   fox and coyote abundance, but a negative influence on raccoon abundance.
   However, our inability to develop strong models that predicted predator
   occupancy indicates that higher sample sizes and more habitat covariates
   are needed. Our simulations indicated that, given our occupancy and
   detection rates, a sample size of 75 sites would allow us to better
   model occupancy covariates. Overall, we found that predator occupancy
   can be assessed at large spatial scales using occupancy approaches,
   particularly using motion-sensitive cameras, which were the most
   time-and cost-efficient of the methods we analyzed. (C) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Many animals exhibit changes in patterns of movement and habitat use as
   they age, and understanding such ontogenetic shifts is important for
   ensuring that habitat management is appropriate for all life stages. We
   used radiotelemetry to study movements and habitat use of juvenile and
   adult gopher frogs (Rana capito) as they migrated from the same ponds
   following metamorphosis or breeding. To supplement radiotelemetry data,
   we also captured adult gopher frogs at drift fences as they left ponds
   for the terrestrial environment. We directly compared patterns of
   movement, directional orientation, macrohabitat use (forest type), and
   microhabitat use (refugia) between the two life stages. Both juveniles
   and adults moved considerable distances from breeding ponds (up to 691
   m) and selected fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest
   over fire-suppressed forest. However, fire-suppressed habitat appeared
   to be a greater barrier to juveniles than adults. Additionally, we found
   differences in microhabitat use; both juveniles and adults used
   underground refuges (e.g., burrows and stump holes) for shelter, but
   juveniles used such refuges less often than adults. juveniles also took
   more time than adults to locate their first refuge after exiting ponds.
   These differences may reflect the juveniles' lack of experience in
   terrestrial habitats. Unlike juveniles, adults are likely more familiar
   with the locations of specific habitat features (e.g., burrows and
   ponds) and may take the shortest routes when moving among them, even if
   it requires moving through fire-suppressed habitat. Previous research
   has recommended that terrestrial habitats surrounding breeding ponds
   should be managed with frequent prescribed fire (i.e., 1-3-year
   intervals) in order to maintain suitable terrestrial habitat for
   juvenile gopher frogs, and our study suggests that these management
   practices are also likely beneficial to adults. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{1. Linked demographic-bioclimatic models are emerging tools for
   forecasting climate change impacts on well-studied species, but these
   methods have been used in few management applications, and species
   interactions have not been incorporated. We combined population and
   bioclimatic envelope models to estimate future risks to the viability of
   a cockatoo population posed by climate change, increased fire frequency,
   beak-and-feather disease and reduced management. 2. The South Australian
   glossy black-cockatoo Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus is restricted
   to Kangaroo Island, Australia, where it numbers 350 birds and is managed
   intensively. The cockatoo may be at particular risk from climate change
   because of its insular geographic constraints and specialised diet on a
   single plant species, Allocasuarina verticillata. The cockatoo
   population model was parameterised with mark-resight-derived estimates
   of survival and fecundity from 13 years of demographic data. Species
   interactions were incorporated by using a climate-change-driven
   bioclimatic model of Allocasuarina verticillata as a dynamic driver of
   habitat suitability. A novel application of Latin Hypercube sampling was
   used to assess the models sensitivity to input parameters. 3. Results
   suggest that unmitigated climate change is likely to be a substantial
   threat for the cockatoo: all high-CO2-concentration scenarios had
   expected minimum abundances of <160 birds. Extinction was virtually
   certain if management of nest-predating brush-tail possums Trichosurus
   vulpecula was stopped, or adult survival reduced by as little as 5\%. In
   contrast, the population is predicted to increase under low-emissions
   scenarios. 4. Disease outbreak, increased fire frequency and reductions
   in revegetation and management of competitive little corellas Cacatua
   sanguinea, were all predicted to exacerbate decline, but these effects
   were buffered by the cockatoo populations high fecundity. 5. Spatial
   correlates of extinction risk, such as range area and total habitat
   suitability, were nonlinearly related to projected population size in
   the high-CO2-concentration scenario. 6. Synthesis and applications.
   Mechanistic demographic-bioclimatic simulations that incorporate species
   interactions can provide more detailed viability analyses than
   traditional bioclimatic models and be used to rank the
   cost-effectiveness of management interventions. Our results highlight
   the importance of managing possum predation and maintaining high adult
   cockatoo survival. In contrast, corella and revegetation management
   could be experimentally reduced to save resources.}},

   plants, animals, birds and various resources such as lakes, rivers,

   rate is always higher. Forest fire is the most notorious danger which
   entirely ruined the environment of the forest. These giant size fires
   can spread out and change the direction rapidly from its source. It is
   very difficult to monitor and control the fires in remote and vast areas

Abstract = {{Fire and herbivory are competitive processes in grassy ecosystems as
   they both consume above-ground biomass. Despite this interaction between
   fire and grazing, herbivore and fire management plans in conservation
   areas are usually perceived, and hence managed, independently. This
   study aims to demonstrate the importance of acknowledging and
   integrating the interdependence between herbivore and fire management.
   We compare average proportional area burnt during years when large-scale
   culling kept herbivore biomass within a narrow range within the Kruger
   National Park, South Africa, against subsequent years of no culling when
   herbivore densities increased to effectively double the biomass.
   Furthermore, to improve our mechanistic understanding, we utilize
   natural gradients in rainfall (north to south) and grazing (distance
   from rivers) to test a conceptual model of how herbivory influences fire
   occurrence under different rainfall regimes. Fires were more prevalent
   during the culling period than thereafter, and the fire suppression
   effect of increasing grazing biomass was most pronounced in areas closer
   to rivers (50\% reduction within 1 km of rivers). The ``grazer
   effect{''} (i.e. difference between \% area burnt between low and high
   grazer biomass years) seems to be more pronounced in arid landscapes
   than in semiarid landscapes, which in turn is more pronounced than in
   the mesic landscapes. Despite elephants being mixed feeders, elephant
   density influences fire occurrence more than the density of buffaloes or
   hippopotami. Synthesis and applications: Herbivore and fire management
   actions should be integrated, as events that influence herbivore
   densities go on to influence fire occurrence in subsequent years. In
   areas with 400-600 mm MAP it is particularly important because changes
   in herbivore numbers-due to drought, predation, disease, or human
   interventions-can result in switches between fire- and
   herbivore-dominated systems, with cascading consequences for
   biodiversity and ecosystem function. Furthermore, grazing gradients (in
   this case distance to closest perennial river) are critical as it allows
   both fire and herbivore-dominated systems to occur within the same
   system along the gradient. This increases management possibilities, as
   management actions that induce grazing gradients can have positive
   implications for maintaining biodiversity in protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Fire suppression, elk (Cervus elaphus Erxleben) browsing and drought
   have been suggested as possible explanations for low aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) ramet regeneration in elk winter range of the
   Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) during the twentieth century. This study
   analyses the relationship between the rates of aspen regeneration,
   biophysical factors and human land use since 1830. This approach reveals
   the importance of indirect human impacts, especially through fire and
   elk management strategies, on forest structure.
   Location This study was conducted in and around the winter range of the
   Jackson Hole elk herd in western Wyoming, USA. Aspen stands in this
   region represent the ecotone between coniferous forest and
   sagebrush-grassland vegetation.
   Methods Age structures of aspen stands were reconstructed from
   tree-rings in order to determine how variation in drought, elk
   populations and fire occurrence may have affected aspen ramet
   regeneration since 1830. The effects of recent prescribed fires and elk
   browse on aspen regeneration were also evaluated by measuring stem
   height, browse intensity and age of ramets <2 m tall in prescribed burns
   and in unburned areas.
   Results Aspen ramet regeneration has occurred consistently but at low
   frequencies since 1830, with three peaks of regeneration: 1860-85,
   1915-40 and 1955-90. Periods of frequent ramet regeneration coincided
   with low to moderate elk populations and aspen regenerated only
   sporadically when elk populations were high. Based on a comparison of
   the age structures with a tree-ring reconstruction of Palmer drought
   severity index (PDSI), observed PDSI and annual precipitation, drought
   variability appears unrelated to episodes of aspen regeneration. Recent
   regeneration patterns suggest that fire does not enhance the recruitment
   of tree-sized aspen stems in the presence of elk browse, although sample
   sizes were small. Since 1900, elk hunting and spatially clustered elk
   feeding in the study area has facilitated low but consistent
   regeneration of aspen ramets in the twentieth century. In contrast,
   extremely low ramet regeneration has been observed in national parks of
   the Rocky Mountains, where elk have been managed according to the
   `natural regulation' policy (no hunting or feeding) since 1969.
   Main conclusions Over time, different management strategies have altered
   the interactions between fire, herbivory and aspen regeneration
   suggesting that management history and the causes of change in
   management, should be explicitly included in ecological studies and
   future management strategies. These results also point to the value of
   using the spatial and temporal variation in human interactions with
   ecological systems as a method for understanding ecological
   relationships.}},

   Pakistan}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{448-458}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Burning agriculture residues has multiple negative effects including
   local air pollution, increase in black carbon and contributions to
   regional and global climate change. This study seeks to understand why
   farmers burn rice residue by analyzing the residue adoption choices of
   farmers in the rice wheat cropping system of Punjab, Pakistan. Rice
   residue has to be burned, removed or incorporated into the soil in order
   to prepare fields for the next wheat crop. The most favored residue
   management practice in Punjab, in terms of total rice area, is complete
   burning of rice residue, followed by removal of rice residue. When
   farmers remove residue, it is pre-dominantly because they use it to feed
   animals. Each practice has different cost implications. Complete residue
   removal costs PKR 4586 (US\$ 55) per acre, on average. Further, complete
   residue removal is, on average, 34\% costlier to farmers than full
   burning of residue. Thus, farmers would need to be subsidized to avoid
   residue burning practices. A number of socio-economic factors influence
   farmers' residue management decisions. For example, the proportion of
   rice area allocated to full residue removal practice increases if the
   farm is owner operated or if the farmer has a larger number of
   livestock. On the other hand, the proportion of area that is fully
   burned increases with farm size, reduction in turn-around time between
   the harvesting of rice and the sowing of wheat, and the ease with which
   farm machinery can be used for preparing the wheat field. The study
   concludes that without some technological innovations to make rice
   residue removal and wheat field preparation less costly, it likely that
   this trend in residue burning will continue. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Periodic wildfire defines plant community composition and dynamics in
   many of the world's semi-arid biomes, whose climates and floras also
   favor wild bee diversity. Invasive flammable grasses, deforestation,
   historical fire suppression and human ignition are increasing fire
   frequency and intensifying its severity, as well as introducing fire to
   previously fireproof biomes. In many of these habitats, bees are key
   pollinators. Many, often most of the solitary bee species and
   individuals in these biomes nest underground (so-called ``mining{''}
   bees). To evaluate their susceptibility to fire, we tested heat
   tolerances of bees' four life stages using an experimental design that
   mimicked heat conduction dynamics of natural soils. All life stages
   survived heating of up to 45 degrees C for 27 min, but none survived
   heating at 54 degrees C for 9 min; the pupal stage survived best. At
   near-lethal temperatures, more prolonged heating caused more mortality.
   These data were related to published studies of heat penetration depths
   in soil during fire and an exhaustive compilation of published nesting
   depths reported for mining bees. We conclude that a small fraction (9\%)
   of the shallowest-nesting mining bee species is likely to die from soil
   heating by wildfire. Among these, ground-nesting megachilids (Osmia,
   Megachile) will be most vulnerable, owing to their shallow horizontal
   nests. Because mining bees prevail in most biomes of the temperate zone,
   any vegetation rehabilitation efforts should therefore expect that bee
   communities will largely survive the immediate effects of wildfire, and
   therefore will need pollen and nectar resources in the year(s) after
   fire. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Tree hollows are a key habitat component for a large number of
   Australian vertebrates and understanding how these resources are used is
   critical for developing successful management and conservation
   strategies for particular species or sets of species. Some hollow-using
   vertebrates are capable of using other kinds of nest sites. The common
   ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) is one of these species and
   it is known to use tree hollows and also to construct nests (dreys) made
   from sticks and leaves. Nest site selection by P. peregrinus may be a
   function of hollow availability. This proposition and several related
   questions were tested in a radio-tracking study that examined patterns
   of tree hollow and drey use by P. peregrinus in a range of vegetation
   types in Booderee National Park in Jervis Bay Territory. In addition,
   this study explored whether hollow and drey use was influenced by a
   wildfire that occurred in the study region in late 2003. It was found
   that use of hollows or dreys appeared to be a function of the
   availability of these resources. Most individuals were either primarily
   hollow users or primarily drey users. These patterns conformed to
   differences we recorded in hollow abundance between vegetation types:
   drey use was most pronounced in shrubland where hollows were rare and
   hollow use was most prevalent in forest where hollows were abundant. We
   found no evidence to suggest that hollow or drey use was influenced by
   fire. There was a trend pattern in our data suggesting that home-range
   size of P. peregrinus was larger in burnt versus unburnt sites but this
   effect was not statistically significant. Evidence was found that P.
   peregrinus selected particular kinds of trees as nest sites. Hollows in
   dead trees were more often used than those in living trees. Smaller
   dreys were most likely to be used. Several kinds of nest-selection
   effects that were contrary to the findings of studies of other arboreal
   marsupials were identified. These included more frequent use of smaller
   diameter trees with fewer cavities. The reasons for these unexpected
   results remain unclear. Findings such as those quantifying gender
   differences in the frequency of drey use, as well as marked
   between-vegetation-type differences in nest-type selection, indicate
   that nest use and nesting behaviour in P. peregrinus may be more complex
   than previously recognised. These findings also indicate that a deep
   understanding of the nesting biology of a species may require careful
   studies of both sexes, across a range of environments, and where
   disturbances have and have not occurred.}},

Abstract = {{One of the consequences of impacts of elephants and fire on woodlands is
   a change in woody cover, which often results in major challenges for
   wildlife managers. Changes in miombo woodland cover in and around Sengwa
   Wildlife Research Area (SWRA) between 1958 and 1996 were quantified by
   analyzing aerial photographs. Woody cover in SWRA decreazed from 95.2\%
   in 1958 to 68.2\% in 1996, with a lowest mean of 62.9\% in 1983. The
   annual absolute rate of woody cover change in SWRA increazed from -1.1\%
   per annum between 1958 and 1964 to a recovery of 1.6\% per annum between
   1993 and 1996, while the annual relative rate increazed from -1.1\% per
   annum between 1958 and 1964 to 3.3\% per annum between 1993 and 1996.
   There was a strong negative correlation between elephant densities and
   woody cover in SWRA, suggesting that loss of woody cover was mainly due
   to elephants. Woodland recovery after 1983 was due to reductions in
   elephant populations through legal and illegal off-take and reductions
   in fire frequency. Surrounding areas experienced less woody cover losses
   than SWRA, mainly due to tree removal by locals whose densities
   increazed after the eradication of tsetse fly in the 1970s.}},

Abstract = {{In the southern United States, herbicide use continues to increase for
   timber management in commercial pine (Pinus spp.) plantations, for
   modifying wildlife habitats, and for invasive plant control. Several
   studies have reported that single applications of forestry herbicides at
   stand initiation have minor and temporary impacts on plant communities
   and wildlife habitat conditions, with some reports of enhanced habitat
   conditions for both game and nongame species. Due to the high resiliency
   of floral communities, plant species richness and diversity rebound
   rapidly after single herbicide treatments, with short- and long-term
   compositional shifts according to the selectivity and efficacy of the
   herbicide used. Recently, however, a shift to the Southeast in North
   American timber supplies has resulted in increased forest management
   intensity. Current site-preparation techniques rely on herbicide
   combinations, often coupled with mechanical treatments and >= 1 years of
   post-planting applications to enhance the spectrum and duration of
   vegetation control. This near-total control of associated vegetation at
   establishment and more rapid pine canopy closure, coupled with shortened
   and repeated rotations, likely will affect plant diversity and wildlife
   habitat quality Development of mitigation methods at the stand and
   landscape levels will be required to minimize vegetative and wildlife
   impacts while allowing continued improvement in pine productivity. More
   uncertain are long-term impacts of increasing invasive plant occupation
   and the projected increase in herbicide use that will be needed to
   reverse this worsening situation. In addition, the potential of
   herbicides to meet wildlife management objectives in areas where
   traditional techniques have high social costs (e.g., prescribed fire)
   should be fully explored.}},

Abstract = {{Converting fields of exotic cool season grass to native warm season
   grass creates habitat for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). If
   converted stands are left unmanaged they can become rank, or
   over-vegetated and unsuitable for grassland wildlife. Northern bobwhite
   populations have been declining across their range for decades, and
   maximizing the amount of habitat is vital to increasing their abundance.
   We investigated prescribed burning followed by herbicide application as
   a management strategy to improve vegetative composition and structure
   for northern bobwhite in rank native warm season grass stands. Within 4
   study areas using a randomized block design, we applied the following
   treatments: burn-only, burn then application of 27.7\% isopropylamine
   salt of imazapyr (ISI), burn then application of 7.78\% imazapyr 62.22\%
   diuron mixture (imazapyr), and burn then 41\% glyphosate application. We
   measured vegetative parameters related to structure and composition and
   compared these metrics between treatments using repeated measures
   analysis of variance blocked by sampling area. We compared grass stands
   to hypothetical optimum conditions for bobwhite using principle
   components analysis. The ISI treatment produced levels of forbs and
   native warm season grass beneficial to bobwhite throughout the study,
   and was initially most similar to optimum conditions. Glyphosate
   treatment also produced vegetation beneficial to bobwhite. Imazapyr
   produced beneficial levels of bare ground during the first growing
   season but none of our treatments produced beneficial levels after 2
   growing seasons. Herbicide treatments initially had greater influence on
   habitat structure than did the burn-only treatment, but all habitat
   structure variables were similar among treatments after 2 growing
   seasons. Our results indicate that management of rank grasslands for
   northern bobwhite occurring at <2-year intervals provides near optimal
   levels of native warm season grass and forbs and has potential to create
   habitat structure. On private lands managed for northern bobwhite where
   landowners do not have access to disking, we recommend prescribed
   burning followed by either 2.81L/ha ISI or 5.62L/ha glyphosate
   application using a non-ionic surfactant followed by annual or biennial
   prescribed burning. We do not recommend the use of imazapyr or burn-only
   treatments when managing rank grasslands for northern bobwhite habitat
   because they do not create beneficial levels of native warm season grass
   or forbs. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use changes (LUC) are one of most significant global change
   processes of the current era, with noticeable consequences on habitat
   loss, due mainly to agricultural expansion and urbanization. The carbon
   cycle dynamics can be affected significantly by LUC, with impacts on
   carbon sequestration and emission rates. Considering the direct effect
   of carbon gases enrichment of the atmosphere on climate change, it is of
   utmost importance to improve the knowledge base on the impacts of
   agricultural-based LUC on carbon sinks, such as soils. This chapter
   reviews the available data on the effects of LUC on soil carbon stocks
   in three major biomes of the southern portion of the South American
   continent (the Cerrado, the Southern Grasslands and the Atlantic
   Forest). The area of soybean crops has expanded almost four times in the
   La Plata Basin Grasslands of Argentina over the past decade, and near
   ten times in the Brazilian Cerrado since the mid-1980s. The area under
   sugarcane crops in Brazil has almost doubled since the mid-1990s,
   occupying approximately 8.5 million ha (Mha) in 2009. In 2011, forestry
   plantations occupied 28\% more land in Brazil than in 2005, with a total
   area of 6.5 Mha (75\% with Eucalyptus and 25\% with Pinus). In general,
   all conversions of natural vegetation to agricultural land-use systems
   in the different biomes have resulted in significant losses of soil
   carbon stocks. The conversion of pastures and grasslands to annual
   croplands in the Rolling Pampas grasslands has decreased C stocks by
   50\% over the last century. This represents a much faster loss rate than
   the loss triggered by the introduction of domestic herbivores over the
   course of the previous nearly four centuries (22\%). These results imply
   that soil degradation caused by annual crops is very rapid and results
   in a strong decrease in carbon stocks. However, adopting soil and water
   conservation management strategies and increasing the complexity of the
   cropping systems through adoption of no-tillage (NT) agriculture,
   well-managed pasture systems, integrated crop-livestock-forestry
   systems, multiple cropping and crop rotation with legume cover species,
   for example, can improve soil carbon sequestration rates by up to nearly
   2.0 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). The elimination of preharvest burning
   practices in sugarcane crops alone can result in gains of up to 0.93 t C
   year(-1) ha(-1). Improving soil and crop management to boost carbon
   sequestration in agricultural systems, while at the same time increasing
   resilience by improving soil quality, is a potential climate change
   mitigation option for farmers in South America.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot experiment designed to test the effect of cattle, small mammals,

   protected from cattle, and (3) seedlings with free access to cattle and
   small mammals. Seedling survival was approximately 50\% in (1) after 4
   years, but there were no surviving seedlings with free access to cattle.
   Elevation in general did not account for variation in survival. Seedling

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Over-abundance of native herbivores is a problem in many forests
   worldwide. The abundance of native macropod wallabies is extremely high
   at Booderee National Park (BNP) in south-eastern Australia. This has
   occurred because of the reduction of exotic predators through an
   intensive baiting program, coupled with the absence of other predators.
   The high density of wallabies at BNP may be inhibiting the recruitment
   of many plant species following fire-induced recruitment events. We
   experimentally examined the post-fire response of a range of plant
   species to browsing by wallabies in a forest heavily infested with the
   invasive species, bitou bush Chrysanthemoides monilifera. We recorded
   the abundance and size of a range of plant species in 18 unfenced
   (browsed) and 16 fenced (unbrowsed) plots. We found the abundance and
   size of bitou bush was suppressed in browsed plots compared to unbrowsed
   plots. Regenerating seedlings of the canopy or middle storey tree
   species Eucalyptus pilularis, Acacia implexa, Allocasuarina littoralis,
   Breynia oblongifolia and Banksia integrifolia were either smaller or
   fewer in number in grazed plots than treatment plots as were the vines
   Kennedia rubicunda, Glycine tabacina and Glycine clandestina. In
   contrast, the understorey fern, Pteridium esculentum increased in
   abundance in the browsed plots relative to unbrowsed plots probably
   because of reduced competition with more palatable angiosperms. Twelve
   months after plots were installed the community structure of the browsed
   and unbrowsed plots was significantly different (P = 0.023, Global R =
   0.091). The relative abundance of C. monilifera and P. esculentum
   contributed most to the differences. We discuss the possible development
   of a low diversity bracken fern parkland in Booderee National Park
   through a trophic cascade, similar to that caused by overabundant deer
   in the northern hemisphere. We also discuss its implications for broad
   scale fox control in southern Australian forests.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine) forest ecosystem restoration is a
   growing emphasis in the southwestern United States to address over 120
   years of forest structure change, decreased forest health, and increased
   potential for disease and wildfire. Restoration treatments replicating
   pre-settlement conditions may reduce tree density by 98\%, are
   detrimental to canopy-dependent wildlife such as tassel-eared squirrel
   (Sciurus aberti), particularly at the patch scale, and are of concern
   when applied at the landscape scale. We examined S. aberti population
   dynamics in north-central Arizona, U.S.A., from 1999 to 2002 at nine
   280-ha sites oriented along a landscape gradient of varying proportions
   (4.6-99.2\%) of unlogged, high-quality (HQ) habitats within a matrix of
   intensively thinned low-quality habitat. Our objectives were to estimate
   S. aberti density, juvenile recruitment, and survival across this
   gradient; quantify patch- and landscape-scale habitat relationships to
   populations; evaluate possible habitat thresholds in squirrel population
   response; and develop forest management recommendations. In regression
   models, both patch-scale and landscape-scale parameters influenced
   squirrel populations. At the patch scale, number of interlocking canopy
   trees was added most frequently, whereas the proportion of HQ habitat
   was the landscape-scale variable added in five of seven models.
   Recruitment and survival at dense, HQ plots were inversely related to
   number of small, sapling-sized trees. Nonlinear thresholds in density
   and recruitment occurred when the proportion of HQ habitat at study
   sites was between 24 and 42\%. Our study points to the importance of
   maintaining HQ habitat in mesoreserves on the landscape at or above this
   threshold range, as well as pursing a mix of forest management
   prescriptions in the matrix surrounding mesoreserves to achieve
   wildlife, forest restoration, and fire risk reduction objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Human land use, through forest management and conversion of natural
   habitats into agroecosystems, has often resulted in loss of
   biodiversity. Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems,
   biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests,
   and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat
   structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been
   reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually
   focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of
   land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis.
   The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been
   studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows
   and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of
   the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate
   habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis
   showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for
   agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From
   10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed
   effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios
   affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging,
   farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing,
   cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest
   fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland
   abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects
   depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in
   agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct
   destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or
   prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects
   detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of fuel reduction timber harvests on forage resources for deer
   in northeastern Washington}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{458}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Fire suppression has increased the canopy cover, stocking density, and
   fuel loads of dry forests in the inland northwestern United States.
   These changes not only lead to high-severity, stand-replacing wildfires
   that may threaten human safety and further alter natural forest
   communities, but also reduce light transmission to the forest floor,
   which can limit production of herbaceous and woody understory vegetation
   that serves as forage for wild ungulates. Therefore, forest managers
   have implemented fuels reduction treatments that reduce the density of
   standing trees in mature stands to restore historic conditions, promote
   healthy forests, and reduce wildfire risk. To test the hypothesis that
   these treatments also improve the quality and quantity of forage
   resources for wild ungulates, we measured biomass, plant species
   composition, and nutritional quality of understory vegetation in 106
   untreated and treated 0.5-ha plots that ranged from 1 to 22 years since
   treatment and 2-100\% canopy cover in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii)/ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Colville
   National Forest of northeastern Washington. On average, fuels reduction
   treatments halved basal area and overstory canopy cover, doubling
   understory vegetation biomass. The most nutritious plants (i.e.,
   composing suitable biomass) and plants most likely to be consumed by
   deer (i.e., acceptable biomass) increased with decreasing forest canopy
   cover, and increased with time since treatment for approximately 14
   years post-harvest, but suitable biomass began declining thereafter.
   Understory plant biomass also responded to a range of site, weather, and
   environmental variables, especially those influencing moisture
   gradients. Our results indicate that active management prescriptions
   intended to reduce fuel loads posed by overstocked conifers can also
   increase the amount of high quality forage for deer and other wild
   ungulates, especially when carefully planning the timing, intensity, and
   rotation schedules of fuels reduction treatments.}},

Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Catchment-scale land-use change is recognised as a major threat to
   aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning globally. In the UK
   uplands rotational vegetation burning is practised widely to boost
   production of recreational game birds, and while some recent studies
   have suggested burning can alter river water quality there has been
   minimal attention paid to effects on aquatic biota. We studied ten
   rivers across the north of England between March 2010 and October 2011,
   five of which drained burned catchments and five from unburned
   catchments. There were significant effects of burning, season and their
   interaction on river macroinvertebrate communities, with rivers draining
   burned catchments having significantly lower taxonomic richness and
   Simpson's diversity. ANOSIM revealed a significant effect of burning on
   macroinvertebrate community composition, with typically reduced
   Ephemeroptera abundance and diversity and greater abundance of
   Chironomidae and Nemouridae. Grazer and collector-gatherer feeding
   groups were also significantly less abundant in rivers draining burned
   catchments. These biotic changes were associated with lower pH and
   higher Si, Mn, Fe and Al in burned systems. Vegetation burning on
   peatland therefore has effects beyond the terrestrial part of the system
   where the management intervention is being practiced. Similar responses
   of river macroinvertebrate communities have been observed in peatlands
   disturbed by forestry activity across northern Europe. Finally we found
   river ecosystem changes similar to those observed in studies of wild and
   prescribed forest fires across North America and South Africa,
   illustrating some potentially generic effects of fire on aquatic

   practices held by users and managers of the Western Arctic Herd (WAH) in

   Collection of population dynamics data received highest priority by
   managers in both Alaska and Canada, with aerial photocensuses,
   recruitment surveys, and calving-ground surveys emphasized. Alaskan
   managers also emphasized making natality and mortality surveys and
   plotting herd movements, whereas in Canada, range-use patterns, wildfire
   effects on movements, delineation of calving grounds, and access of
   caribou to traditional users are important in management. Differences in
   priorities to collect biological data to manage the WAH and the BQH
   resulted from the larger range for the BQH, complications of monitoring
   2 herds with overlapping ranges in Canada, somewhat greater funding and
   logistic resources available in Alaska, and the greater number of
   jurisdictions in Canada. Indigenous hunters, who are the primary users
   of the caribou of the WAH and the BQH, found herd monitoring practices
   used by managers, such as radiocollaring and aerial surveys, more

   greater willingness to accept restrictive hunting quotas, if they were

   prescribed burns. Prior to prescribed burning, genetic diversity
   decreased within glades and differentiation increased among glades. With
   woodland burning, genetic diversity within glades first decreased during
   an expanding colonization phase, but then increased as a dynamically
   stable metapopulation was established. Population differentiation among
   glades also stabilized in the metapopulation under weak
   isolation-by-distance. This study is one of the first to examine the
   genetic changes in a species of conservation concern throughout all the
   stages of decline and recovery and shows the importance of
   landscape-level restoration for maintaining the genetic integrity of
   populations. This study also demonstrates how mark-recapture and genetic
   data together can yield detailed insight into metapopulation dynamics
   that would be impossible from just one type of data alone.}},

Abstract = {{IgE antibodies in the sera of subjects allergic to beta -lactam
   antibiotics detect a spectrum of specificities ranging from side-chain
   groups to an entire penicillin or cephalosporin molecule. In addition to
   such structural heterogeneity of allergenic determinants, TgE antibodies
   in the sera of different allergic subjects show heterogeneous
   recognition responses. Detailed immunochemical studies were carried out
   on the sera of penicillin-allergic subjects that showed selective and
   unexpected reactions with the frequently prescribed penicillin,
   amoxicillin. Antibodies from one subject reacted only with the
   amoxicilloyl determinant while TgE from another subject showed multiple
   reactivity with penicilloyl and penicillanyl determinants of different
   penicillins but not with the amoxicilloyl determinant. Quantitative
   hapten inhibition studies revealed that the combining sites of the
   former antibodies were complementary to amoxicillin in a form that
   permits binding to the hydroxyaminobenzyl side-chain and the
   thiazolidine ring carboxyl. These conditions are satisfied with the drug
   in the `-oyl' but not in the `-anyl' form which involves linkage through
   the 2-carboxyl of the thiazolidine ring. With the second serum,
   adsorption studies showed that the wide-ranging reactivity of IgE was
   due to a single population of antibodies that detected a common
   specificity on the different penicillins. Combining site studies
   revealed clear recognition of the benzyl portion of the side-chain of
   benzylpenicilloyl, benzylpenicillanyl, ampicilloyl, ampicillanyl and
   amoxicillanyl determinants when free antibody access to the side-chain
   was possible but little or no recognition of the ring hydroxyl of
   amoxicillin. Such uninhibited access may not occur, however, when
   amoxicillin is conjugated in the `-oyl' form since opening the beta
   -lactam ring allows increased flexibility, and rotation of the molecule
   and the possibility of close association of the hydroxyaminobenzyl
   side-chain of amoxicillin with the linked peptide carrier. In such close
   steric association, H-bonding involving the ring hydroxyl and amino
   acids of the carrier may prevent antibody access to the side-chain
   region of the amoxicilloyl determinant. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Forest management, fire and climate change can have profound and lasting
   effects on catchment water balances and water yields. This is because
   significant changes in the growth and structure of forests can lead to
   changes in evaporation, rainfall interception and transpiration, and in
   resulting streamflow.
   Process-based models that incorporate the major environmental influences
   on the growth and water use of forests and vegetation, and on the
   consequential effects on streamflow, allow us to explore the likely
   effects of the change in forest structure on resulting catchment water
   balances. Results from these models are being used, to underpin the
   development of water and forest management strategies and policies. In
   this paper we describe and discuss the application of two
   catchment-scale process-based models, their assumptions and limitations,
   and provide some guidance for the further development and future
   application of these models.
   Macaque, a process-based model, was used to develop models for several
   forested catchments that supply water to Melbourne. They were used to
   investigate the likely effects of various bushfire scenarios and climate
   change projections on catchment water balances. A limitation of this
   approach is the absence of a growth module that allows for the effects
   of climate and edaphic factors on the development of forests. The model
   uses a set of empirical functions that describe the time course of leaf
   area index (LAI) for a range of forest types.
   Changes in the LAI can have relatively large effects on resulting
   evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. Adjustments in the LAI empirical
   functions based on field measurements led to a decrease in mean
   catchment average LAI by nearly 14\%, with a consequential decrease in
   ET of over 6\%, and an increase in streamflow of over 18\%. This
   highlights the value in collecting LAI data for model parameterisation.
   Recent work incorporating the 3PG+ forest growth model into the CAT
   (Catchment Analysis Tool) framework (3PG+ in CAT) allows for the
   investigation of catchment-scale responses in mixed-landuse catchments,
   as well as having a forest-growth module that characterises the effects
   of management and environmental influences on forest growth and on water
   use.
   3PG+ in CAT is able to take into account the effects of a changing
   climate (but at least presently, not CO2 concentrations) on growth and
   water use. Not only is the growth and LAI influenced by topography and
   location within a catchment, but changes in the environment over time
   will lead to responsive changes in LAI and ET. For example, invoking a
   step change in rainfall (-7.1\%) and temperature (+1.5 degrees C), both
   considered `moderate' climate change projections, led to an increase in
   LAI (3.4\%) and a decrease in ET (-7.1\%) for a plantation in Eastern
   Victoria.
   While 3PG has been widely applied to single-species plantations and
   even-aged, relatively homogenous forests, it has had limited application
   to more species rich forest systems. The challenge now is to enhance
   3PG+ in CAT and apply it to these more complex systems.
   As in most physically-based models, LAI is a major control of all
   evapotranspiration processes. With the influences of climate change, the
   past can no longer be considered a reliable predictor of the future. If
   we want to be able to represent possible changes in rainfall and
   temperature on catchment hydrology, it is essential we take into account
   these effects on vegetation growth and ET.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation restoration in strongly degraded lands has inherent
   limitations Among the most relevant limitations in Mediterranean
   Mountains are severe drought and stressful levels of irradiance during
   summer Thus, it is common that seedlings planted in open ground incur
   high rates of early mortality. In the context of a project of
   restoration of a burned area in Southern Spain. we evaluate the
   efficiency of watering and enrichment with native soil, and the
   influence of seedling age on survival and growth of 9 late-successional
   tall shrubs and trees planted in open ground. We also explore how
   small-scale variation in environmental variables relates to
   establishment success Our results show an overall positive effect of
   watering on the survival of planted seedlings, while the effects of
   enrichment with native soil and age of planted seedlings were
   species-specific. Seedling establishment varied markedly with the
   presence of ravines, which duplicated seedling survival. This suggests
   that ravines may be more easily restored, improving their role as
   corridors in landscape designs of restoration. Independently of the
   treatment applied. Rosa sp and Crataegus monogyna, both fleshy-fruited
   species, had the highest rates of establishment. In conclusion, this
   study shows the viability of low aggressive restoration techniques to
   assist vegetation recovery in fire-degraded environments Specifically,
   watering and planting in ravines should be considered where restoration
   practices are applied in areas lacking vegetation cover. Some species
   highly attractive for animal dispersers and of easy establishment (Rosa
   sp and Crataegus sp.) could be used to enhance spontaneous regeneration

Abstract = {{Populations of secretive marsh birds (Rallidae and Ardeidae) have
   declined in North America in the last decades. Despite drastic habitat
   changes, the Colorado River delta supports four species of protected
   marsh birds: California Black Rail, Virginia Rail, Least Bittern and
   Yuma Clapper Rail. Our goal was to assess the status (2010-2011) and
   detect population changes (1999-2011) of marsh birds in the Colorado
   River delta. This effort was focused on the Cienega de Santa Clara and
   the recent disturbance events that occurred in this wetland (changes in
   inflows, dredging and wildfires), but included other areas of the delta
   as well. The Cienega provides critical habitat for the four species,
   with estimated abundance of 405 California Black Rails, 7152 Virginia
   Rails, 8652 Least Bitterns and 8642 Yuma Clapper Rails. Populations of
   these species have remained stable since 1999, with no significant
   trend, although with some fluctuations in some years. Other wetlands in
   the delta also provide important habitat, especially El Doctor Wetlands
   for California Black Rails and Virginia Rails, the Hardy and Colorado
   rivers for Yuma Clapper Rails and Least Bitterns, and Laguna del Indio
   for Yuma Clapper Rails. The detections of marsh birds in 2011 were
   amongst the highest since the monitoring program began in 1999. This was
   probably linked to the disturbance regime that was recreated with a
   series of events in the Cienega, including the dredging of sediment,
   variations of inflows, and an extensive wildfire. Wetlands in the
   Colorado River delta support the majority of breeding Yuma clapper rails
   and important populations of other marsh birds. As these are shared
   species by Mexico and the U.S., the conservation and restoration of the
   delta should be a shared responsibility. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Despite numerous studies on the response of Mediterranean ecosystems to
   fire, few have measured the respective resilience of vegetation and
   fauna compartments. For 28 years, we conducted an annual monitoring of
   avifauna composition and vegetation structure (cover profile) following
   a severe wildfire in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) stand in southern France.
   Our aim was to estimate the time necessary for this bird-vegetation
   system to return to a state analogous to its pre-fire state. In the
   burned plots, low herbaceous and shrub layers were gradually replaced by
   higher, woody layers of vegetation. Neither bird species richness nor
   inter-annual bird species turnover showed significant differences from
   one year to the next over the study period. In contrast, bird species
   composition did change steadily, leading to an almost complete
   replacement of early-successional species by late-successional ones.
   Using the first axes of multivariate analyses as `proxy variables' of
   vegetation or avifauna recoveries, we estimated by extrapolation the
   recovery times of these two ecosystem components at ca. 50 and 35 years,
   respectively. Towards the end of the study period, the rate of change in
   avifauna composition decreased comparatively to that of vegetation
   structure. Our results show that holm oak woodlands are highly resilient
   and seem to tolerate a similar to 50-year fire interval, even if it
   remains to be assessed how resilient they would be in the case of
   increased fire frequency. More generally, our multivariate approach,
   which allows comparative estimations of resilience in different
   components of an ecosystem using qualitative as well as quantitative
   criteria, could be applied to various case studies in disturbance and
   restoration ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Despite large efforts to generate and extend management innovations for

   socioeconomic groups of permittees were identified by cluster analysis:
   ``Large-Scale Operators,{''} 2 types of traditional URanchers,{''} and 2
   types of ``Hobbyists.{''} The main concern across groups was losing
   access to public land, and coping strategies overall included passivity
   (64\%), intensification of private-land use (27\%), and enterprise
   diversification (5\%). Across all groups the 4 highest use rates
   uniformly occurred for livestock cross-breeding (92\%), livestock
   supplementation (80\%), planting improved forages on private land (76
   \%), and interaction with extension personnel (73\%). The 4 lowest rates
   (3 to 12\%) occurred for use of futures markets, range-trend monitoring
   on private land, estrus synchronization, and short-duration grazing
   (SDG). Groups varied in use of feed and financial consultants,
   prescribed fire on private land, forward contracting, and controlled
   grazing systems other than SDG, with Large-Scale Operators tending to
   use these the most. Larger operation size and higher levels of formal
   education and income for managers were positively associated with using
   more practices. Hobbyists tended to use practices the least. Practices
   which were less complex, clearly linked to animal production,
   potentially more cost-effective, and had greater compatibility with
   operational goals were favored. Socioeconomic groups and coping

Abstract = {{Paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent, causes neuropathic pain whose
   supraspinal pathophysiology is not fully understood. Dysregulation of
   sodium channel expression, studied mainly in the periphery and spinal
   cord level, contributes to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. We
   examined gene expression of sodium channel (Na-v) subunits by real time
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   at day 7 post first administration of paclitaxel, when mice had
   developed paclitaxel-induced thermal hyperalgesia. The ACC was chosen
   because increased activity in the ACC has been observed during
   neuropathic pain. In the ACC of vehicle-treated animals the threshold
   cycle (Ct) values for Na(v)1.4, Na(v)1.5, Na(v)1.7, Na(v)1.8 and
   Na(v)1.9 were above 30 and/or not detectable in some samples. Thus,

   paclitaxel significantly increased the expression of Na-v beta 1 and
   Na-v beta 3, but not Na-v beta 2 and Na-v beta 4, sodium channel beta
   subunits compared to vehicletreated animals. These findings suggest that

   developed to reflect different degrees of management intervention. Each
   alternative was evaluated under different scenarios and analyzed by
   explicitly examining value-based trade-offs among water quality,

Abstract = {{In a previous article, Beschta et al. (Environ Manag 51(2):474-491,
   2013) argue that grazing by large ungulates (both native and domestic)
   should be eliminated or greatly reduced on western public lands to
   reduce potential climate change impacts. The authors did not present a
   balanced synthesis of the scientific literature, and their publication
   is more of an opinion article. Their conclusions do not reflect the
   complexities associated with herbivore grazing. Because grazing is a
   complex ecological process, synthesis of the scientific literature can
   be a challenge. Legacy effects of uncontrolled grazing during the
   homestead era further complicate analysis of current grazing impacts.
   Interactions of climate change and grazing will depend on the specific
   situation. For example, increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperatures may
   increase accumulation of fine fuels (primarily grasses) and thus
   increase wildfire risk. Prescribed grazing by livestock is one of the
   few management tools available for reducing fine fuel accumulation.
   While there are certainly points on the landscape where herbivore
   impacts can be identified, there are also vast grazed areas where
   impacts are minimal. Broad scale reduction of domestic and wild
   herbivores to help native plant communities cope with climate change
   will be unnecessary because over the past 20-50 years land managers have
   actively sought to bring populations of native and domestic herbivores
   in balance with the potential of vegetation and soils. To cope with a
   changing climate, land managers will need access to all available
   vegetation management tools, including grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Mate change and fire suppression have facilitated expansion of
   pinyon-juniper woodlands into sage-brush-Steppe ecosystems of the Great
   Basin, USA, resulting in a loss of biological diversity To assess the
   effects of using prescribed fire in restoration efforts, ant abundance,
   species richness, and composition were examined pre- and post-burn along
   the elevation and tree cover gradients encompassed by a pinyon-juniper
   woodland in a central Nevada watershed. Ants were sampled using pitfall
   traps in 6 sites for the elevation study and in 2 sites for the tree
   cover study, representing paired burn and control sites in a ran domized
   block design. Vegetation and ground cover variables were also sampled to
   determine how variation in ant populations was correlated with
   differences in vegetation and ground cover. Ant species richness
   remained unchanged for all treatments. Tree cover had no significant
   effect on ant populations. Significantly more ants were trapped after
   the burn treatment on burn plots. Variation in ant populations was not
   directly correlated with any of the vegetation or ground cover
   variables. According to ANOVA and multivariate analyses, elevation had
   the greatest effect on changes in ant communities, likely due to
   increased moisture availability Our results suggest that management for
   conservation of sagebrush-steppe ecosystems in this and similar
   watersheds should include a range of elevations to ensure maximum ant
   species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anthropogenic habitat modification are evident on
   tropical Pacific islands where forests have been extensively converted

   selection in the critically endangered Tuamotu Kingfisher (Todiramphus
   gambieri gertrudae), which is confined to a single population on the
   low-elevation island of Niau Atoll in French Polynesia. Our analyses
   indicate that resources associated with foraging underlie space use and
   habitat selection of Tuamotu Kingfishers at multiple spatial scales. At
   the island scale, the occurrence of the species was best predicted by
   habitat features associated with foraging opportunities, including
   agricultural coconut forest with open understory, hunting perches, and
   exposed ground. Conversely, the species' distribution was negatively
   associated with undisturbed vegetation, including primary feo forest and
   fallow coconut plantation. At the home-range scale, utilization
   distributions of radiomarked Tuamotu Kingfishers also indicated that
   birds selected agricultural coconut forest and least preferred native
   feo forest. Observations further indicated that foraging birds selected
   coconut plantations managed with prescribed burning for hunting. The
   Tuamotu Kingfisher is a rare example of a threatened tropical species
   that likely benefits from agricultural management, and our findings
   provide support for conservation strategies based on establishing rescue
   populations on other islands with coconut plantations. We suggest that

Abstract = {{Northern Australia's native mammal fauna has undergone a severe decline
   in recent decades. Putative factors include altered fire regimes, cat
   predation, poisoning by cane toads and disease. Populations of northern
   quolls, Dasyurus hallucatus severely declined following cane toad
   invasion and have not recovered. We monitored a population of northern
   quolls in Kakadu National Park that was supplemented with `toad-smart'
   individuals, to determine whether cane toad poisoning or predation was
   preventing population recovery. The population increased after
   supplementation, but crashed in March 2012, coincident with a high level
   of trap disturbance by canids. Canid predation was the major source of
   mortality for radio-tagged quolls. We used population viability analyses
   (PVA) to explore how changes in mortality influenced the likelihood of
   extinction. With no management, the quoll population has a 48\% chance
   of extinction over the next 20 years. Sensitivity analyses highlighted
   small population size and high mortality as the main reasons for the
   population failing to recover. We then explored whether population
   supplementation or reducing mortality could increase the likelihood of
   persistence. One year of supplementation increased the probability of
   population survival over 20 years from 51.6\% to 81.7\%. Continuing
   supplementation for 3 or 5 years increased the probability of population
   survival to 96.5\% and 98.1\% respectively. Similarly, a 2.5\% reduction
   in the rate of mortality for juveniles and adult females increased the
   probability of population persistence over 20 years to 83.6\%. Further
   reductions in mortality of 5\% and 10\% increased the probability of
   survival to 92.2\% and 99.4\% respectively. The results of the PVA
   suggest that small interventions could have a significant positive
   effect on population survival. We hypothesize that predation from
   food-subsidized canids is preventing the recovery of quoll populations.
   Future management actions to reduce mortality, via improved fire
   management, or through population supplementation, are necessary to
   ensure the persistence of the northern quoll.}},

Abstract = {{Previous fire experiments using artificial fuel have shown that annual
   fires. especially those applied in the autumn, can effectively control
   coppicing understorey shrubs in semi-arid woodlands. Such frequent fire
   is impossible to apply under natural conditions given the limited time
   available for Sufficient herbage fuel to accumulate. Preliminary
   screening studies were therefore undertaken to test the hypothesis that
   chemical sprays applied at concentrations less than those normally
   recommended could be used to mimic high-frequency experimental fires.
   The effectiveness of I I chemicals (7 arboricides and 4 dessicants)
   applied at a range of concentrations was assessed on one site by
   spot-spraying 5-year-old coppice regeneration of Eremophila mitchellii
   (budda or false sandalwood) and E sturtii (turpentine), Chemical
   activity was assessed by regularly monitoring leaf effect, i.e. by
   rating the degree of leaf discolouration. scorching. blackening and
   ultimately leaf fall, over the ensuing 12 months following treatment.
   Arsenal (R) and Roundup CT (R) induced the highest shrub mortalities
   across all size classes while mortality rates were consistently higher
   for E. mitchellii than for E sturtii. A second experiment involved 5
   chemicals (4 arboricides and 1 dessicant) applied in a similar manner to
   7-year-old seedlings of Cassia nemophila (syn. Senna nemophila) (punty
   bush). Significant damage to foliage (> 80\% leaf effect) of all 3 shrub
   species was recorded 2 months after treatment with either Roundup CT (R)
   or Roundup (R) (i,e. either 450 or 360 g/L glyphosate respectively), as
   well as with Arsenal (R) (250 g/L imazapur + 60 g/L, isopropylamine) but
   only at the highest concentration (i.e. 100\% of the `recommended'
   rate), In some lower concentration treatments. leaf effect was still
   increasing 6 months after treatment.
   In a second series of screening experiments involving 1- and 2-year-old
   coppices sprayed in autumn and spring, significant interaction occurred
   between coppice age and season of spraying when averaged over both
   Eremophila species. At lower concentrations (i.e. 12.5 and 25\% of
   maximum recommended rate), autumn application of Roundup CT (R) was more
   effective than spring application, especially once regeneration was 2
   years old. Gramoxone (R) was also most effective at all rates above
   12.5\% of the maximum when applied in the autumn to two-year-old
   coppice, However. Garlon (R) (600 g/L triclopyr) and Tordon 50-D (R) (50
   g/L picloram + 200 g/L 2,4-D) were more effective when applied to
   1-year-old coppice in the spring. Overall, the most effective
   low-concentration treatment was Roundup CT R applied in the autumn to
   two-year-old coppice. Low-concentration treatment of one-year-old
   coppice with Roundup CT (R) and Arsenal (R) was also consistently more
   effective when carried Out in the autumn (80-90\% leaf effect). The
   probability of shrub mortality was inversely related to coppice biomass
   with smaller coppices clearly more vulnerable to the added pressure
   imposed by secondary chemical treatment. independent of application

Abstract = {{Tropical savannas have a ground cover dominated by C-4 grasses, with
   fire and herbivory constraining woody cover below a rainfall-based
   potential. The savanna biome covers 50\% of the African continent,
   encompassing diverse ecosystems that include densely wooded Miombo
   woodlands and Serengeti grasslands with scattered trees. African
   savannas provide water, grazing and browsing, food and fuel for tens of
   millions of people, and have a unique biodiversity that supports
   wildlife tourism. However, human impacts are causing widespread and
   accelerating degradation of savannas. The primary threats are land
   cover-change and transformation, landscape fragmentation that disrupts
   herbivore communities and fire regimes, climate change and rising
   atmospheric CO2. The interactions among these threats are poorly
   understood, with unknown consequences for ecosystem health and human
   livelihoods. We argue that the unique combinations of plant functional
   traits characterizing the major floristic assemblages of African
   savannas make them differentially susceptible and resilient to
   anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem change. Research must address how
   this functional diversity among African savannas differentially
   influences their vulnerability to global change and elucidate the

Abstract = {{Invasive forest pathogens can harm cultural, economic, and ecological
   resources. Here, we demonstrate the potential of endemic tree pathogen
   resistance in forest disease management using Phytophthora ramorum,
   cause of sudden oak death, in the context of management of tanoak
   (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), an ecologically unique and highly valued
   tree within Native American communities of northern California and
   southern Oregon in the United States. We surveyed resistance to P.
   ramorum on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation and Yurok Indian
   Reservation in a set of study sites with variable management
   intensities. Variation in resistance was found at all sites with similar
   mean and variation across stands, and resistance tended to have a random
   spatial distribution within stands but was not associated with previous
   stand management (thinning or prescribed fire) or structural
   characteristics such as tree density, basal area, or pairwise
   relatedness among study trees. These results did not suggest host,
   genetic, management, or environment interactions that could be easily
   leveraged into treatments to increase the prevalence of resistant trees.
   We applied epidemiological models to assess the potential application of
   endemic resistance in this system and to examine our assumption that in
   planta differences in lesion size-our measure of resistance-reflect
   linkages between mortality and transmission (resistance) versus reduced
   mortality with no change in transmission (tolerance). This assumption
   strongly influenced infection dynamics but changes in host
   populationsour conservation focus-was dependent on community-level
   variation in transmission. For P. ramorum, slowing mortality rates
   (whether by resistance or tolerance) conserves host resources when a
   second source of inoculum is present; these results are likely
   generalizable to pathogens with a broader host range. However, when the
   focal host is the sole source of inoculum, increasing tolerant
   individuals led to the greatest stand-level pathogen accumulation in our
   model. When seeking to use variation in mortality rates to affect
   conservation strategies, it is important to understand how these traits
   are linked with transmission because tolerance will be more useful for
   management in mixed-host stands that are already invaded, compared with
   single-host stands with low or no pathogen presence, where resistance
   will have the greatest conservation benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Past and present human activities, such as historic agriculture and fire
   suppression, are widespread and can create depauperate plant
   communities. Although many studies show that herbivory on focal plants
   depends on the density of herbivores or the composition of the
   surrounding plant community, it is unclear whether anthropogenic changes
   to plant communities alter herbivory. We tested the hypothesis that
   human activities that alter the plant community lead to subsequent
   changes in herbivory. At 20 sites distributed across 80 300 hectares, we
   conducted a field experiment that manipulated insect herbivore access
   (full exclosures and pseudo-exclosures) to four focal plant species in
   longleaf pine woodlands with different land-use histories
   (post-agricultural sites or non-agricultural sites) and degrees of fire
   frequency (frequent and infrequent). Plant cover, particularly
   herbaceous cover, was lower in post-agricultural and fire suppressed
   woodlands. Density of the dominant insect herbivore at our site
   (grasshoppers) was positively related to plant cover. Herbivore access
   reduced biomass of the palatable forb Solidago odora in frequently
   burned post-agricultural sites and in infrequently burned
   non-agricultural woodlands and increased mortality of another forb
   (Pityopsis graminifolia), but did not affect two other less palatable
   species (Schizachyrium scoparium and Tephrosia virginiana). Herbivory on
   S. odora exhibited a hump-shaped response to plant cover, with low
   herbivory at low and high levels of plant cover. Herbivore density had a
   weak negative effect on herbivory. These findings suggest that changes
   in plant cover related to past and present human activities can modify
   damage rates on focal S. odora plants by altering grasshopper foraging
   behavior rather than by altering local grasshopper density. The
   resulting changes in herbivory may have the potential to limit natural
   recovery or restoration efforts by reducing the establishment or
   performance of palatable plant species.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean populations of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) are
   typically small and have a scattered distribution, being threatened by
   human activities and forest fires. In the framework of the
   genetic-resources conservation program of this species, a native
   multi-age stand located in a Mediterranean area (central Spain) was
   studied using three highly polymorphic nuclear microsatellites (SSRs).
   Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using Moran's index in
   order to detect fine-scale structure in both natural regeneration and
   mature trees. The spatial pattern of seed flow based on dispersed
   progeny was studied using a highly reliable subset of parent-offspring
   matches obtained by means of parentage analysis and simulation-based
   calculation of statistical confidence. Maritime pine showed a fine-scale
   structure at the seedling stage. In natural regeneration, the
   autocorrelograms indicated a patch size of approximately 10 m. The
   fine-scale structure seems to be produced by a restricted seed gene
   flow. In fact, there was an excess of parent-offspring matches in a
   radius of 15 m from the parent trees. Pines with a heavy seed, such as
   P. pinaster, are expected to have a short dispersal distance, thus
   producing a fine-scale structure. However, the fine-scale structure did
   not persist in the mature trees. Within population genetic structure in
   Mediterranean pines may be affected by a number of post-dispersal events
   (e.g. mortality due to the severity of the Mediterranean climate and
   animal-mediated secondary dispersal during the summer period). Thus,
   great alteration in the pattern produced by the initial seed rain and
   differences in genetic structure between tree cohorts are expected.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion to agriculture, habitat fragmentation, and the loss of native
   grazers have made tallgrass prairie one of the most endangered
   ecosystems. One management option for the remaining prairie parcels,
   patch-burn grazing (PBG), applies a controlled burn to a portion of the
   prairie to attract cattle, creating a mosaic of more-and less-grazed
   patches. Although beneficial to cattle and grassland birds, the
   potential impacts of PBG on streams have not been studied, and a
   holistic approach is needed to ensure against adverse effects. We used a
   Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess potential impacts of PBG
   with and without riparian protection on tallgrass prairie headwater
   streams. We sampled stream macroinvertebrates and benthic organic matter
   2 yr before and 2 yr during PBG treatments on two grazed watersheds with
   riparian fencing (fenced), two unfenced grazed watersheds (unfenced),
   and two ungrazed (control) watersheds. Very fine benthic organic matter
   increased significantly (51\%) in unfenced streams compared with
   controls (p < 0.007), and fine particulate organic matter (< 1 mm and >
   250 mu m) increased 3-fold in the unfenced streams compared with
   controls (p = 0.008). The contribution of fine inorganic sediments to
   total substrata increased 28\% in unfenced streams during PBG, which was
   significantly different from controls (p = 0.03). Additionally, the
   abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa decreased
   from 7635 to 687 individuals m-2 in unfenced streams, which was
   significantly lower than in control streams (p = 0.008). Our results
   indicate that PBG adversely influences prairie streams through sediment
   inputs and reductions in sensitive invertebrate taxa, but riparian
   fencing can alleviate these impacts.}},

Abstract = {{The Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) is one of the most endangered
   mammals in the world, with only 30-50 adults surviving in and around
   Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and the adjacent Big Cypress
   National Preserve, hlanagers at these areas conduct annual prescribed
   burns in pine (Pinus sp.) as a cost-effective method of managing
   wildlife habitat. Our objectives were to determine if temporal and
   spatial relationships existed between prescribed fire and panther use of
   pine. To accomplish this, we paired fire-event data from the Refuge and
   the Preserve with panther radiolocations collected between 1989 and
   1998, determined the time that had elapsed since burning had occurred in
   management units associated with the radiolocations, and generated a
   frequency distribution based on those times. We then generated an
   expected frequency distribution, based on random use relative to time
   since burning. This analysis revealed that panther use of burned pine
   habitats was greatest during the first year after a management unit was
   burned. Also, compositional analysis indicated that panthers were more
   likely to position their home ranges in areas that contained pine. We
   conclude that prescribed burning is important to panther ecology. We
   suggest that panthers were attracted to <1-year-old burns because of
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and other prey responses to
   vegetation and structural changes caused by the prescribed fires. The
   strong selection for stands burned within 1 year is a persuasive
   indication that it is the bunting in pine, rather than the pine per se,
   that most influenced habitat use. Before burning rotation lengths are
   reduced, however, we suggest managers determine effects of shorter
   burning intervals on vegetation composition and evaluate the
   landscape-scale changes that would result.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands of the Prairie Pothole Region exist in a matrix of grassland
   dominated by intensive pastoral and cultivation agriculture. Recent
   conservation management has emphasized the conversion of cultivated
   farmland and degraded pastures to intact grassland to improve upland
   nesting habitat. The consequences of changes in land- use cover that
   alter watershed processes have not been evaluated relative to their
   effect on the water budgets and vegetation dynamics of associated
   wetlands. We simulated the effect of upland agricultural practices on
   the water budget and vegetation of a semipermanent prairie wetland by
   modifying a previously published mathematical model ( WETSIM). Watershed
   cover/ land-use practices were categorized as unmanaged grassland (
   native grass, smooth brome), managed grassland ( moderately heavily
   grazed, prescribed burned), cultivated crops ( row crop, small grain),
   and alfalfa hayland. Model simulations showed that differing rates of
   evapotranspiration and runoff associated with different upland plant-
   cover categories in the surrounding catchment produced differences in
   wetland water budgets and linked ecological dynamics. Wetland water
   levels were highest and vegetation the most dynamic under the managed-
   grassland simulations, while water levels were the lowest and vegetation
   the least dynamic under the unmanaged- grassland simulations. The
   modeling results suggest that unmanaged grassland, often planted for
   waterfowl nesting, may produce the least favorable wetland conditions
   for birds, especially in drier regions of the Prairie Pothole Region.
   These results stand as hypotheses that urgently need to be verified with
   empirical data.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{115-137}},
Abstract = {{Stand structure, the arrangement and interrelationships of live and dead
   trees, has been linked to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling,
   wildlife habitat, and climate regulation. The objective of this review
   was to synthesize literature on stand structural dynamics of North
   American boreal forests, addressing both live tree and coarse woody
   debris (CWD) characteristics under different disturbance mechanisms
   (fire, clearcut, wind, and spruce budworm), while identifying regional
   differences based on climate and surficial deposit variability. In fire
   origin stands, both live tree and CWD attributes are influenced
   initially largely by the characteristics of the stand replacing fire and
   later increasingly by autogenic processes. Differences in stand
   structure have also been observed between various stand cover types.
   Blowdown and insect outbreaks are two significant non-stand replacing
   disturbances that can alter forest stand structure through removing
   canopy trees, freeing up available growing space, and creating
   microsites for new trees to establish. Climate and surficial deposits
   are highly variable in the boreal forest due to its extensive geographic
   range, influencing stand and landscape structure by affecting tree
   colonization, stand composition, successional trajectories, CWD
   dynamics, and disturbance regimes including regional fire cycles.
   Further, predicted climate change scenarios are likely to cause
   regional-specific alterations in stand and landscape structure, with the
   implications on ecosystem components including wildlife, biodiversity,
   and carbon balance still unclear. Some stand structural attributes are
   found to be similar between clearcut and fire origin stands, but others
   appear to be quite different. Future research shall focus on examining
   structural variability under both disturbance regimes and management
   alternatives emulating both stand replacing and nonstand replacing
   natural disturbances.}},

Title = {{Optimal decisions for salvage logging after wildfires}},
Journal = {{OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{96}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Strategic, tactical, and operational harvesting plans for the forestry
   and logging industry have been widely studied for more than 60 years.
   Many different settings and specific constraints due to legal,
   environmental, and operational requirements have been modeled, improving
   the performance of the harvesting process significantly. During the
   summer of 2017, Chile suffered from the most massive wildfires in its
   history, affecting almost half a million hectares, of which nearly half
   were forests owned by medium and small forestry companies. Some of the
   stands were burned by intense crown fires, which always spread fast,
   that burned the foliage and outer layer of the bark but left standing
   dead trees that could be salvage harvested before insect and decay
   processes rendered them unusable for commercial purposes. Unlike the
   typical operational programming models studied in the past, in this
   setting, companies can make insurance claims on part or all of the burnt
   forest, whereas the rest of the forest needs to be harvested before it
   loses its value. This problem is known as the salvage logging problem.
   The issue also has an important social component when considering medium
   and small forestry and logging companies: most of their personnel come
   from local communities, which have already been affected by the fires.
   Harvesting part of the remaining forest can allow them to keep their
   jobs longer and, hopefully, leave the company in a better financial
   situation if the harvesting areas are correctly selected. In this work,
   we present a novel mixed-integer optimization-based approach to support
   salvage logging decisions, which helps in the configuration of an
   operational-level harvesting and workforce assignment plan. Our model
   takes into account the payment from an insurance claim as well as future
   income from harvesting the remaining trees. The model also computes an
   optimal assignment of personnel to the different activities required.
   The objective is to improve the cash position of the company by the end
   of the harvest and ensure that the company is paying all its liabilities
   and maintaining personnel. We show how our model performs compared to
   the current decisions made by medium and small-sized forestry companies,
   and we study the specific case of a small forestry company located in
   Cauquenes, Chile, which used our model to decide its course of action.

Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{290-298}},
Abstract = {{Context. Temporal reduction in shelter is an indirect primary impact of
   fire. Removal of animal refugia has implications for shelter site
   selection and fidelity - factors that have been largely overlooked in
   studies of Australian rodent fauna. This information is critical for
   guiding species conservation and appropriate land management including
   prescribed burning practices.
   Aims. We sought to determine which features of burnt heath were selected
   as shelter sites by the eastern chestnut mouse, whether there was sex
   and/or seasonal variation in shelter site selection and whether we could
   identify primary refugia.
   Methods. We completed a radio-telemetry study to identify diurnal refuge
   sites and compare habitat attributes with those of a matched set of
   control sites. We then used habitat features and fidelity parameters to
   classify refuge site use.
   Key results. We found the eastern chestnut mouse selected shelters with
   the presence of specific structures and had taller, denser vegetation
   than randomly selected control sites. There were no differences in
   habitat selection between the sexes. Shelter sites in the non-breeding
   season had greater vegetation density compared with those used in the
   breeding season. In the breeding season, the eastern chestnut mouse
   showed no evidence of increased fidelity to particular refuges.
   Vegetation density in winter was the best predictor of a primary refuge
   compared with whether or not an animal returned to a shelter site or the
   amount of time spent in a shelter site. Mice were ephemeral and
   non-gregarious in their refuge use. There was some evidence for
   inheritance of refuge sites from a parent, as well as inter-season
   shelter site fidelity.
   Conclusions. The eastern chestnut mouse selected refugia that had
   habitat attributes offering maximum protection. Seasonality in refuge
   site selection is likely to reflect the reproductive and environmental
   trade-offs in critical resources during different seasons. The
   maintenance of multiple, rarely occupied shelters by the eastern
   chestnut mouse is consistent with data for other mammals.
   Implications. Fire management should ensure retention of vegetation
   structure on the ground layer, dense habitat patches in burned areas,
   and be carefully planned during the winter season to maintain shelter
   and refuge sites to assist population persistence.}},

Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Disturbances such as fire reduce the structural complexity of
   terrestrial habitats, increasing the risk of predation for small prey
   species. The postfire effect of predation has especially deleterious
   effects in Australian habitats owing to the presence of invasive
   mammalian predators, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cat (Felis
   catus), that rapidly exploit burned habitats. Here, we investigated
   whether the provision of artificial shelter could alleviate the risk of
   predation perceived by two species of small marsupial, the dunnarts
   Sminthopsis hirtipes and S. youngsoni, in open postfire habitat in the
   sandridge system of the Simpson Desert, central Australia. We installed
   artificial shelters constructed from wire mesh that allowed passage of
   the dunnarts but not of their predators at one site, and measured and
   compared the perceived risk of predation by the dunnarts there with
   those on a control site using optimal patch-use theory (giving-up
   densities, GUDs). GUDs were lower near artificial shelters than away
   from them, and near dune crests where dunnarts typically forage,
   suggesting that the shelters acted as corridors for dunnarts to move up
   to the crests from burrows in the swales. Foraging was lower near the
   crest in the control plot. Two-day foraging bouts were observed in
   dunnart activity, with recruitment to GUD stations occurring a day
   earlier in the augmented shelter plot. Despite these results, the
   effects of the shelters were localized and not evident at the landscape
   scale, with GUDs reduced also in proximity to sparse natural cover in
   the form of regenerating spinifex grass hummocks. Mapping dunnart
   habitat use using the landscape of fear (LOF) framework confirmed that
   animals perceived safety near shelter and risk away from it. We
   concluded that the LOF framework can usefully assess real-time
   behavioral responses of animals to management interventions in
   situations where demographic responses take longer to occur.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean region, wildfires have devastating effects on
   animals with limited mobility. With their poor dispersal abilities,
   their habitats on vegetation and in litter, and their sensitivity to
   humidity and shade, we expected land snails to be an interesting model
   to assess short, medium and long-term impact of fires on fauna
   biodiversity and their resilience. Stratified sampling was carried out
   on 12 sampling sites in garrigues and forests of Provence (southeastern
   France), according to fire regime (number of fires, fire intervals and
   age of the last fire) over the past 30 years. Data were investigated
   using diversity indexes, Kruskal-Wallis test, dendrogram of affinities
   and Correspondence Analysis (CA). We found, however, that Mediterranean
   land snail communities are particularly resilient to fires. Although
   abundance is drastically reduced in the short-term, species richness and
   community diversity are preserved provided that the time lapse between
   two successive fires is longer than the time required for recovery (i.e.
   around 5 years). This high community resilience in the short-term may be
   partly due to ecological and ethological aptitudes of land snails.
   However, these astonishing results, which have implications for
   conservation biology, are mainly due to the presence, within burned
   areas, of cryptic refuges that allow initial land snail survival,
   malacofauna persistence after successive fires and consistent
   biogeographical patterns in the long-term.}},

Abstract = {{Forest sustainability depends on reliable tree regeneration but seedling
   survival is affected by climate change and disturbance. Based on seed
   introduction experiments, we compared recruitment of native pine species
   in central Spain in totally burned, thinned, and dense stands of Spanish
   black pine (Pinus nigra Am. ssp salzmannii). Seed sources included P.
   nigra from three elevations bracketing its range, as well as the
   fire-adapted species maritime pine (P. pinaster) and the mesic-adapted
   species Scots pine (P. sylvestris). In addition, seed predation effect
   was also tested. Small and large herbivores as well as rodents were
   excluded using cages. All seeds had high viability in laboratory
   germination tests and all displayed high emergence in field trials.
   However, unprotected seedlings and those that emerged in thinned or
   dense stands did not survive the first growing season. Surviving
   seedlings were only found in totally burned stands. Protected P. nigra
   seedlings had the highest survival, reaching 23\%. Protected seedlings
   of P. pinaster and P. sylvestris averaged 11.5\% and 10.9\%,
   respectively. Unprotected seedlings of any species had less than 2\%
   survival. The unexpected result of higher mortality under a sheltering
   canopy compared with open post-wildfire conditions may be due to wetter
   spring during the experiment. Overall, the results indicate that native
   species currently still regenerate best within the environment of their
   present range, even though future climate or fire disturbance may lead
   to distributional shifts. Protection is necessary for successful pine
   regeneration in the study region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although disturbances such as fire and native insects can contribute to
   natural dynamics of forest health, exceptional droughts, directly and in
   combination with other disturbance factors, are pushing some temperate
   forests beyond thresholds of sustainability. Interactions from
   increasing temperatures, drought, native insects and pathogens, and
   uncharacteristically severe wildfire are resulting in forest mortality
   beyond the levels of 20th-century experience. Additional anthropogenic
   stressors, such as atmospheric pollution and invasive species, further
   weaken trees in some regions. Although continuing climate change will
   likely drive many areas of temperate forest toward large- scale
   transformations, management actions can help ease transitions and
   minimize losses of socially valued ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Although the effects of forest management on watershed hydrology are
   well recognized, little is known about how upland management affects the
   hydrology and functions of wetlands embedded within upland forests
   (hereafter, embedded wetlands). We simulated the effects of upland tree
   basal area (ie total cross-sectional area of trees per land area) and
   different upland management approaches on wetland hydrological,
   biogeochemical, and habitat functions. Increases in upland basal area
   and associated forest evapotranspiration reduced wetland inundation
   depth and duration. Wetland global warming potential decreased with
   higher upland basal area, driven by lower methane production in drier
   wetlands. Amphibian habitat suitability decreased with increasing basal
   area due to reduced wetland inundation. Simulations of three common
   25-year management scenarios - namely, constant basal area, fire
   management, and pine plantation - highlighted impacts of forest
   structure that vary over time. Prescribed fires that recurred every 3
   years generated cyclic patterns in wetland hydrology and function,
   whereas pine plantations transitioned from wet to dry regimes with stand
   growth. This work represents a first step to linking upland management,
   wetland hydrology, and wetland functions, highlighting opportunities for
   optimizing forest management to provide landscape-scale ecosystem

Title = {{Potential Impacts of Insect-Induced Harvests in the Mixed Forests of New
   England}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Forest insects and pathogens have significant impacts on U.S. forests,
   annually affecting an area nearly three times that of wildfires and
   timber harvesting combined. However, coupled with these direct effects
   of forest insects and pathogens are the indirect impacts through
   influencing forest management practices, such as harvesting. In an
   earlier study, we surveyed private woodland owners in the northeastern
   U.S. and 84\% of respondents indicated they intended to harvest in at
   least one of the presented insect invasion scenarios. This harvest
   response to insects represents a potentially significant shift in the
   timing, extent, and species selection of harvesting. Here we used the
   results from the landowner survey, regional forest inventory data, and
   characteristics of the emerald ash borer (Species:Agrilus
   planipennisFairmaire, 1888) invasion to examine the potential for a
   rapidly spreading invasive insect to alter harvest regimes and affect
   regional forest conditions. Our analysis suggests that 25\% of the
   woodland parcels in the Connecticut River Watershed in New England may
   intend to harvest in response to emerald ash borer. If the emerald ash
   borer continues to spread at its current rate within the region, and
   therefore the associated management response occurs in the next decade,
   this could result in an increase in harvest frequencies, from 2.6\%
   year(-1)(historically) to 3.7\% year(-1)through to approximately 2030.
   If harvest intensities remain at levels found in remeasured Forest
   Inventory and Analysis plots, this insect-initiated harvesting would
   result in the removal of 12\%-13\% of the total aboveground biomass.
   Eighty-one percent of the removed biomass would be from species other
   than ash, creating a forest disturbance that is over twice the magnitude
   than that created by emerald ash borer alone, with the most valuable
   co-occurring species most vulnerable to biomass loss.}},

Journal = {{SOUTHERN FORESTS}},

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{229-236}},
Abstract = {{There is a limited availability of land for the expansion of South
   African black wattle plantations. One way to increase productivity is to
   ensure the survival of seedlings during regeneration, thereby increasing
   the stocking of compartments. Soil invertebrate pests constitute one of
   the important causes of seedling mortality. The effect of different
   plantation residue management practices on the incidence of these pests
   was unknown. Fourteen trials were planted on previous wattle sites over
   six growing seasons. Seven different plantation residue management
   regimes (windrowed-burnt-weeded, windrowed-burnt-ripped, fallow {[}mowed
   or manually weeded], windrowed-burnt- old arable, windrowed-burnt-closer
   spacing, and windrowed-broadcast-herbicide) were appraised using
   multivariate analysis. Seedlings were evaluated monthly after planting
   for a period of six months. Stressed, damaged and dead seedlings were
   uprooted and inspected to determine the cause of death. Members of the
   soil invertebrate pest complex included whitegrubs and cutworms that
   generally had a higher pest status than millipedes, nematodes,
   grasshoppers, ants, false wireworms, termites and crickets. A higher
   incidence (1.44\%) of cutworm damage was observed in the
   windrowed-burnt-ripped and fallow sites. However, there was a greater
   infestation of soil invertebrate pests on sites where the plantation
   residue was windrowed-burnt-weeded or `broadcast' (20.34\%) than in the
   other treatments (windrowed-burnt-ripped or fallow; 2.36\%). The
   addition of a rip treatment to a depth of about 50 cm in the windrow and
   burn regime significantly reduced the infestation of soil invertebrate
   pests, especially whitegrubs. Seedlings that were planted at a closer
   spacing in windrowed and burnt sites also had a lower incidence of soil
   invertebrate pest damage (7.79\%). Regeneration of an old arable site in
   Seven Oaks had a sporadically high incidence of nematodes (11.58\%).
   These findings have important management implications because windrow
   and burn are frequent plantation residue management practices in wattle
   silviculture. Insecticide application is the alternative option,
   although its use is restricted by Forest Stewardship Council guidelines.}},

Title = {{Recoupling fire and grazing reduces wildland fuel loads on rangelands}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fire suppression and exclusion, the historically dominant paradigm of
   fire management, has resulted in major modifications of fire-dependent
   ecosystems worldwide. These changes are partially credited with a recent
   increase in wildfire number and extent, as well as more extreme fire
   behavior. Fire and herbivory historically interacted, and research has
   shown that the interaction creates a unique mosaic of vegetation
   heterogeneity that each disturbance alone does not create. Because fire
   and grazing have largely been decoupled in modern times, the degree to
   which the interaction affects fuels and fire regimes has not yet been
   quantified. We evaluated effects of fire-only and pyric herbivory on
   rangeland fuels and fire behavior simulated using BehavePlus at four
   sites across the southern Great Plains. We predicted patches managed via
   pyric herbivory would maintain lower fuel loads, and less intense
   simulated fire behavior than fire alone. We found that time since fire
   was a significant predictor of fuel loads and simulated fire behavior
   characteristics at all sites. Fuel loads and simulated fire behavior
   characteristics (flame length and rate of spread) increased with
   increasing time since fire in all simulated weather scenarios. Pyric
   herbivory mediated fuel accumulation at all sites. Mean fuel loads in
   fire-only treatments exceeded 5000 kg/ha within 24 months, but pyric
   herbivory treatments remained below 5000 kg/ha for approximately 36
   months. Simulated flame lengths in fire-only treatments were
   consistently higher (up to 3 9) than in pyric herbivory treatments.
   Similarly, fire spread rates were higher in fire-only than in pyric
   herbivory treatments in all simulated weather conditions. Although all
   sites had potential to burn in the most extreme weather conditions,
   pyric herbivory reduced fuel accumulations, flame lengths, and rates of
   spread across all weather patterns simulated. These reductions extended
   the amount of time standard wildland firefighting techniques remain
   effective. Therefore, incorporating pyric herbivory into fuel management
   practices, in areas of high herbaceous productivity, increases the
   effectiveness of fuel treatments.}},

Title = {{Determinants of soil CO2 flux from a sub-humid grassland: Effect of fire

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{760-770}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Soil CO2 flux (J(CO2)) was measured at midday over a 2-yr period in
   undisturbed tallgrass prairie (Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA) to quantify
   seasonal and annual budgets, to evaluate temperature and moisture as
   determinants of soil CO2 flux, and to assess the effect of a common land
   management tool, spring fire, and fire history on soil respiration. We
   hypothesized that: (1) maximum rates and annual estimates of soil J(CO2)
   would be greater in more productive burned sites than in unburned sites,
   (2) soil J(CO2) would be greater in newly burned sites with a history of
   fire exclusion than in annually burned sites (consistent with
   differences in aboveground production), and (3) soil temperature and
   water availability would be primary abiotic determinants of soil J(CO2)
   in tallgrass prairie. A preliminary assessment of the effects of large
   herbivores on soil J(CO2) was included to evaluate the hypothesis that
   removal of aboveground biomass would reduce soil J(CO2). Results
   indicated that spring fire increased maximum monthly soil J(CO2) by
   20-55\% relative to unburned tallgrass prairie, with greatest monthly
   differences measured in April (fourfold higher in burned sites). In
   burned sites that differed in fire history, maximum monthly J(CO2) in
   annually burned prairie was 33\% greater than in burned sites with a
   history of fire exclusion. Soil J(CO2) in these latter sites was still
   significantly higher than in unburned sites. Soil J(CO2) in sites grazed
   by bison was reduced by as much as 30\% relative to adjacent ungrazed
   areas. Reduced root biomass and activity in grazed areas, unburned
   sites, and sites with a history of fire exclusion suggest that plants
   play a major role in determining soil J(CO2) in this grassland. Soil
   temperature at 5 cm was related strongly to midday J(CO2) in both
   annually burned sites (r(2) = 0.58) and unburned sites (r(2) = 0.71). In
   contrast, differences in soil moisture among sites, enhanced by
   comparing irrigated grassland to control areas, increased maximum
   monthly J(CO2) by only 8\%. Thus, soil temperature was the primary
   abiotic determinant of soil J(CO2) during this study.
   Maximum monthly estimates of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie ranged
   from 10.3 mu mol CO2 . m(-2) . s(-1) in unburned sites to 15.1 mu mol .
   m(-2) . s(-1) in annually burned irrigated sites, whereas annual
   estimates varied from 4.7 to 7.8 kg CO2/m(2). Over the 2-yr period,
   spring fire increased estimated annual soil J(CO2) by 38-51\% relative
   to unburned sites, while irrigation increased annual soil J(CO2) by
   13\%. These estimates for tallgrass prairie are much higher than those
   reported for most temperate ecosystems but are similar to estimates for
   tropical forests. Characteristics of undisturbed tallgrass prairie that
   may lead to high levels of soil J(CO2) include: high above- and
   belowground productivity; a relatively high proportion of C stored
   belowground; levels of soil microbial biomass and activity that are
   among the highest in native ecosystems in the United States; and the
   lack of a single dominant factor such as temperature, moisture, or
   nutrient availability, that consistently limits biotic processes during
   the growing season. The sensitivity of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie
   to different land use practices (fire and grazing) suggests that it is
   critical to include these factors in the development of grassland C
   budgets, as well as in regional models that estimate biogeochemical
   responses to land use change.}},

Title = {{The influence of fine-scale topography on the impacts of Holocene fire
   in a Tasmanian montane landscape}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Tasmania's montane temperate rainforests contain some of Australia's
   most ancient and endemic flora. Recent landscape-scale fires have
   impacted a significant portion of these rainforest ecosystems. The
   complex and rugged topography of Tasmania results in a highly variable
   influence of fire across the landscape, rendering predictions of
   ecosystem response to fire difficult. We assess the role of topographic
   variation in buffering the influence of fire in these endemic rainforest
   communities. We developed a new 14 000-year (14-ka) palaeoecological
   dataset from Lake Perry, southern Tasmania, and compared it to
   neighbouring Lake Osborne (<250 m distant) to examine how topographic
   variations influence fire and vegetation dynamics through time. Repeated
   fire events during the Holocene cause a decline in montane rainforest
   taxa at both sites; however, in the absence of fire, rainforest taxa are
   able to recover. Montane temperate rainforest taxa persisted at Lake
   Perry until European settlement, whilst these taxa were driven locally
   extinct and replaced by Eucalyptus species at Lake Osborne after 2.5 ka.
   Contiguous topographic fire refugia within the Lake Perry catchment
   probably provided areas of favourable microclimates that discouraged
   fire spread and supported the recovery of these montane temperate
   rainforests.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the 7-year effects of three restoration treatments on leaf
   physiology and insect-resistance characteristics of pre-settlement age
   ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Gus Pearson
   Natural Area (GPNA) in northern Arizona. Restoration treatments were:
   (1) thinned in 1993 to approximate pre-Euro-American settlement stand
   structure, (2) thinned plus prescribed burned in 1994 and 1998, and (3)
   untreated control. Tree physiological and insect-resistance
   characteristics were measured in year 2000, 7 years after thinning,
   using the same procedures as an earlier study performed in 1996.
   Consistent with the 1996 results, pre-dawn water potential in 2000 was
   consistently lower in the control than both thinned treatments. Both
   thinned treatments continued to have increased foliar nitrogen
   concentration in leaves 7 years after treatment. However lower leaf
   nitrogen concentration in the thinned and burned com- pared with the
   thinned treatment suggests lower nitrogen availability to trees in
   repeatedly burned plots. Analysis of leaf gas exchange characteristics
   and carbon isotope content (delta(13)C) suggests continued stimulation
   of photosynthesis by both thinning treatments. Differences among
   treatments in resin volume, a measure of bark beetle resistance,
   depended on season of measurement. Trees in both thinning treatments
   continued to have increased leaf toughness, a measure of resistance to
   insect folivores. Our results show that many beneficial effects of

Abstract = {{Understanding where species occur and how difficult they are to detect
   during surveys is crucial for designing and evaluating monitoring
   programs, and has broader applications for conservation planning and
   management. In this study, we modelled occupancy and the effectiveness
   of six sampling methods at detecting vertebrates across the Top End of
   northern Australia. We fitted occupancy-detection models to 136 species
   (83 birds, 33 reptiles, 20 mammals) of 242 recorded during surveys of
   333 sites in eight conservation reserves between 2011 and 2016. For
   modelled species, mean occupancy was highly variable: birds and reptiles
   ranged from 0.01-0.81 and 0.01-0.49, respectively, whereas mammal
   occupancy was lower, ranging from 0.02-0.30. Of the 11 environmental
   covariates considered as potential predictors of occupancy, topographic
   ruggedness, elevation, maximum temperature, and fire frequency were
   retained more readily in the top models. Using these models, we
   predicted species occupancy across the Top End of northern Australia
   (293,017 km(2)) and generated species richness maps for each species
   group. For mammals and reptiles, high richness was associated with
   rugged terrain, while bird richness was highest in coastal lowland
   woodlands. On average, detectability of diurnal birds was higher per day
   of surveys (0.33 +/- 0.09) compared with nocturnal birds per night of
   spotlighting (0.13 +/- 0.06). Detectability of reptiles was similar per
   day/night of pit trapping (0.30 +/- 0.09) as per night of spotlighting
   (0.29 +/- 0.11). On average, mammals were highly detectable using
   motion-sensor cameras for a week (0.36 +/- 0.06), with exception of
   smaller-bodied species. One night of Elliott trapping (0.20 +/- 0.06)
   and spotlighting (0.19 +/- 0.06) was more effective at detecting mammals
   than cage (0.08 +/- 0.03) and pit trapping (0.05 +/- 0.04). Our

Abstract = {{We derived a method of estimating the direction and magnitude of cover
   changes for potentially maximizing wildlife abundance on an area. We
   illustrate the method with data on cover selection by northern bobwhites
   (Colinus virginianus) collected in the Texas Panhandle from 2000 to
   2003. We used radiotelemetry to determine use of cover associations,
   Geographic Information System analysis to determine their availability,
   and logic related to use-availability analysis to collapse 95\% kernel
   home ranges to usable space. Bobwhites selected mixed-shrub cover
   consisting of sand plum (Prunus angustifolia) and fragrant sumac (Rhus
   aromatica), and they avoided or neutrally used 8 other cover
   associations. However, grass upland and sand sagebrush (Artemisia
   filifolia ) associations occurred in >= 86\% of home ranges (n = 96
   bobwhites with >= 30 radiolocations). Usable space averaged 54.2\% +/-
   1.72 SE of kernel home ranges. The data indicated that adding about 226
   ha of mixed-shrub cover or a structural homologue while simultaneously
   reducing the quantity of most other cover associations would maximize
   bobwhite abundance. An area with 30-60\% mixed-shrub cover, with the
   balance in grass upland and sand sagebrush, and with cover dispersed
   such that no point was > 30 m from mixed-shrub cover was hypothetically
   optimal for bobwhites in our region. Within certain constraints (e.g.,
   financial, social, edaphic), managers can apply this method by
   manipulating cover types through relevant management practices (e.g.,
   planting, prescribed burning, mechanical removal of vegetation). This
   method, with minor modification, could also be used to decrease usable
   space on an area, and thus decrease wildlife densities, should that be
   the manager's objective.}},

Abstract = {{The Critically Endangered Burmese star tortoise Geochelone platynota is
   endemic to the dry zone of central Myanmar. Although quantitative
   assessments are lacking, populations are believed to be in decline
   throughout its limited range due to over-collecting for international
   markets. We conducted star tortoise surveys during 2000-2001 at two
   sites in central Myanmar: Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary, a protected
   area established in 1998-1999, and Myaleik Taung, an area recently
   proposed for protected status. G. platynota populations of global
   conservation significance were found at both sites. Because tortoises
   are protected by local religious beliefs and commercial collecting is so
   far nonexistent, the Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung offer excellent
   prospects for star tortoise conservation. The Sanctuary is well
   patrolled, protected from wildfires, and access is rigorously
   controlled. Recommended conservation actions at Myaleik Taung include
   management of livestock grazing, prescribed burning, and elimination of
   fuelwood cutting.}},

Abstract = {{Treatments to restore understory plant communities of mature (50-80-year
   old) longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) and reduce risks of wildfire
   were applied to 10 ha plots that had a substantial shrub layer due to
   lack of fire. Plots were located in the Coastal Plain of Alabama and
   treatments consisted of: (1) untreated control, (2) growing season
   prescribed bum, (3) thin only, (4) thin plus growing season bum, and (5)
   herbicide plus growing season bum. Thin plus bum plots had significantly
   higher tree mortality compared to bum only and control plots and,
   overall, fire was the primary cause of tree death. Most tree mortality
   occurred within 1-year of treatment. From 2002 to 2004, we captured
   75,598 Coleoptera in multiple funnel traps comprising 17 families and
   130 species. Abundance of all Coleoptera, combined was not different
   among treatments. Species richness was significantly higher on thin plus
   burn plots compared to thin only and control plots. Scolytinae
   (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were more abundant on thin plus bum plots
   compared to control plots in fall 2002 but in fall 2003 they were more
   abundant on thin plus bum, thin only, and herbicide plus burn compared
   to controls. Among Scolytinae, Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier),
   Xyleborinus saxeseni (Ratzeburg), Xyleborus sp. 3, and Hylastes tenuis
   (Eichhoff), showed varying responses to the treatments. Other
   Curculionidae were significantly more abundant on thin only and
   herbicide plus bum plots compared to all other treatments in spring 2003
   and in spring 2004 they were more abundant on herbicide plus bum plots
   compared to thin plus bum treatments. Among Cerambycidae, Xylotrechus
   sagittatus (Germar) was higher in abundance in fall 2003 on thin plus
   bum plots compared to all other treatments except herbicide plus bum
   plots. Within the predator complex, Trogositidae were higher on thin
   plus bum plots compared to all other treatments except thin only plots
   in spring 2003, and Cleridae abundance was higher in spring 2004 on bum
   only plots compared to all other treatments. Linear regression analyses
   of dead trees per plot versus various Coleoptera showed captures of
   Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, Trogositidae, Acanthocinus nodosus
   (Fabricius), Temnochila virescens (Fabricius), and X. saxeseni increased
   with increasing number of dead trees. Our results show that the

Abstract = {{The population simulation computer program, ALEX, was used to estimate
   the probability of extinction of the endangered species Leadbeater's
   possum, Gymnobelideus leadbeateri McCoy, in complex network:; of remnant
   habitat patches within south-eastern Australian forests. Forest
   inventory data stored in a Geographic Information System (GIS) were
   interrogated to derive information on the spatial location and size of
   potentially suitable habitat patches within four management area:, in
   the central highlands of Victoria: the O'Shannassy Water Catchment and
   the Murrindindi, Ada and Steavenson Forest Blocks. This information was
   combined with data on the life history attributes of G. leadbeateri, as
   well as sub-models that tracked the dynamics of key habitat attributes,
   to simulate the behaviour of metapopulations of the species over the
   next 150 years. Analyses were completed for simulated populations of
   animals in: (i) hypothetical isolated patches of old growth forest of
   varying size, and, (ii) assemblages of real patches of potentially
   suitable habitat within each of the four study areas. In addition, a
   detailed investigation was completed for the Ada Forest Block in which
   areas of habitat of different size and spatial isolation were deleted
   from the patch structure:.
   The results of our analyses indicated that single isolated populations
   inhabiting patches of less than or equal to 20 ha were highly
   susceptible to extinction. For areas that were larger than this, the
   probability of survival increased with the patch size and approached 1\%
   for patches that were > 150 ha. Our analyses of complex ensembles of
   patches indicated that G. leadbeateri is vulnerable to extinction during
   the next 150 years within the Murrindindi and Ada Forest Blocks. The
   species was predicted to have better prospects of survival in the
   Steavenson Forest Block and the O'Shannassy Water Catchment where there
   are relatively large remaining areas of old growth forest (approximately
   250 ha and 6420 ha respectively), although we did not include the
   impacts of catastrophic events such as logging and wildfire in our
   investigation. The retention of the few remaining relatively large
   habitat patches (i.e. those > 12 ha) was predicted to be critical for
   the persistence of G. leadbeateri in the Ada Forest Block. Conversely,
   the deletion of relatively small (< 3 ha) and/or isolated patches of old
   growth had a minor impact on the predicted probability of extinction. We
   discuss the implications of our findings for the development of
   conservation strategies for the species, particularly the identification
   of areas to be excluded from logging.}},

Abstract = {{Wintering Henslow's sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii) populations rely on

   Henslow's sparrows in coastal pine savannas at the Mississippi Sandhill
   Crane National Wildlife Refuge, Jackson County, Mississippi, USA, during
   January and February 2001 and 2002. We used the known-fate modeling
   procedure in program MARK to evaluate the effects of burn age (1 or 2
   growing seasons elapsed), burn season (growing, dormant), and calendar
   year on the survival rates of 83 radiomarked Henslow's sparrows. We
   found strong evidence that Henslow's sparrow survival rates differed by
   burn age (with higher survival in recently burned sites) and by year
   (with lower survival rates in 2001 likely because of drought
   conditions). We found some evidence that survival rates also differed by
   burn season (with higher survival in growing-season sites), although the
   effects of burn season were only apparent in recently burned sites.
   Avian predation was the suspected major cause of mortality (causing 6 of
   14 deaths) with 1 confirmed loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus)
   depredation. Our results indicated that recently burned savannas provide

Abstract = {{D.L. Serventy censused birds in Kings Park, Perth, between 1928 and 1937
   and again between 1952 and 1955.  Abundance was estimated by the
   frequency with which species were detected on censuses.  The counts were
   repeated in 1986 by H. F. Recher.  A total of 44 species were recorded
   during censuses.  Since the first counts, were made, 14 species
   decreased in abundance by more than 15\%, and 9 species went locally
   extinct.  Eleven species increased in abundance by more than 20\% (5 by
   more than 50\%), and the abundance of 19 remained unchanged (frequency
   of occurrence changed by less than 15\%).
   Although nearly 300 ha of the park's 400 ha area remains as native
   vegetation, this vegetation has been degraded by logging, changed fire
   regimes, construction of trails, and invasion by exotic weeds.  Changes
   in the ground vegetation have had a particularly significant impact. 
   Nine of the 16 species that declined in abundance are ground foragers. 
   Of the species that increased in abundance, a number benefit from the
   greater availability of nectar, fruits, and water in the suburban
   gardens that have developed around the park.  The Australian Raven
   (Corvus coronoides) has become particularly abundant and predation by
   ravens on nests may contribute to the decline of some species.
   Changes to the park vegetation, suburban development of the park's
   immediate surroundings, and the extensive clearing of vegetation
   throughout southwestern Australia appear to have had a more significant
   effect on the park's avifauna than the size of the park or its isolation
   in an urban environment.  Poor management has seriously reduced the
   capacity of Kings Park to support native wildlife.  Changes in park
   management designed to rehabilitate native vegetation, control weeds,
   and control ravens are necessary to prevent the further loss of species
   from the park's avifauna.}},

Abstract = {{North American bats are experiencing declines in part due to
   anthropogenic impacts resulting in habitat loss and disturbance. In
   eastern deciduous forests, bats rely on forest resources for all or part
   of the year. Therefore, to promote conservation of bats, it is essential
   to determine whether current forest management techniques are compatible
   with habitat use by bats. We evaluated the relative effect of landscape
   characteristics, including forest management variables, on sex-specific
   foraging habitat of an insectivorous forest-dwelling bat species, the
   evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis), and predicted areas of suitable
   habitat for N. humeralis. A total of 18 variables were assessed using a
   maximum-entropy (Maxent) machine-learning approach: eight land use-land
   cover classes, three stand types, two topography measures, normalized
   difference vegetation index, and four forest management variables.
   Females showed the highest probability of presence closer to stands
   treated with prescribed fire, whereas males showed the highest
   probability of presence closer to reforested stands. In general, males
   exhibited more flexibility than females in their habitat selection. The
   Maxent model further indicated that habitat associated with suitability
   of > 70\% was similar to 4 times larger for males than females, and
   predicted an additional area of suitable foraging habitat where no
   presence locations had been recorded. Our modeling approach may be

Abstract = {{Restoration efforts to improve vigor of large, old trees and decrease
   risk to high-intensity wildland fire and drought-mediated insect
   mortality often include reductions in stand density. We examined 15-year
   growth response of old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Jeffrey pine
   (Pinus jeffreyi) trees in northeastern California, U.S.A. to two levels
   of thinning treatments compared to an untreated (control) area. Density
   reductions involved radial thinning (thinning 9.1 m around individual
   trees) and stand thinning. Annual tree growth in the stand thinning
   increased immediately following treatment and was sustained over the 15
   years. In contrast, radial thinning did not increase growth, but slowed
   decline compared to control trees. Available soil moisture was higher in
   the stand thinning than the control for 5 years post-treatment and
   likely extended seasonal tree growth. Our results show that large, old
   trees can respond to restoration thinning treatments, but that the level
   of thinning impacts this response. Stand thinning must be sufficiently
   intensive to improve old tree growth and health, in part due to
   increasing available soil moisture. Importantly, focusing stand density
   reductions around the immediate neighborhood of legacy trees was
   insufficient to elicit a growth response, calling into question
   treatments attempting to increase vigor of legacy trees while still
   maintaining closed canopies in dry, coniferous forest types. Although
   radial thinning did not affect tree growth rates, this treatment may
   still achieve other resource objectives not studied here, such as
   protecting wildlife habitat, reducing the risk of severe fire injury,

Abstract = {{Bark beetle outbreaks and wildfire are important disturbances in conifer
   ecosystems, yet their interactions are not well understood. We evaluated
   whether fire injury increased susceptibility of lodgepole pines (Pinus
   contorta) to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), how
   it influenced beetle reproductive success, and whether beetle population
   phase altered this interaction. Eight sites that experienced wildfire
   and eight unburned sites were examined in the Greater Yellowstone
   Ecosystem (USA). Half were in areas where D. ponderosae was undergoing
   outbreaks, and half were in areas with low populations. We examined 2056
   trees one year after fire for burn injury and beetle attack. We
   quantified beetle reproductive success in a random sample of 106 trees,
   and measured gallery areas of D. ponderosae and competing subcortical
   herbivores in 79 additional trees. Baited flight traps sampled
   stand-level populations of Subcortical herbivores and predators.
   Wildfire predisposed trees to D. ponderosae attack, but nonlinearly,
   with moderately injured trees being most preferred. This tree-level
   interaction was influenced by stand-level beetle population size, in
   that both healthy and fire-injured trees of all classes were attacked
   where populations were high, but no healthy trees, and only low and
   moderately injured trees were killed where populations were low. The
   number of adult brood produced per female was likewise curvilinear,
   being highest in moderately injured trees. This reflected an apparent
   trade-off, with high intraspecific competition arising from the large
   number of beetles needed to overcome defenses in healthy trees, vs. high
   interspecific competition and low substrate quality in more injured
   trees.
   These results suggest that fire-injured trees can provide a reservoir
   for D. ponderosae during periods when populations are too low to
   overcome defenses of healthy trees, and might otherwise face localized
   extinction. However, the likelihood of populations increasing from
   endemic to outbreak levels in response to increased susceptibility is
   offset by the opposing constraints of lower substrate quality and higher
   competitor load in severely injured hosts, and the relative scarcity of
   moderately injured trees. Wildfire may confer some reproductive
   increases to populations already outbreaking. We present a conceptual
   model of how these disturbances and inherent feedbacks interact to
   affect beetle population dynamics.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Management of trees with high conservation value under altered land
   use is challenging. This applies to European aspen Populus tremula, a
   keystone tree species for species conservation in northern forests. Fire
   suppression in managed forest has reduced niches for sexual regeneration
   in aspen while levels of browsing have increased with increasing numbers
   of ungulate herbivores.
   2. We combined observational and experimental data from 1953 to 2007 to
   unravel patterns and causes of changes in aspen abundance in Sweden, the
   country with the largest forests in the EU. The density of small-sized
   aspen ramets showed a peak in the early 1970s, followed by a marked
   decrease. Numbers of moose Alces alces, the most important browser on
   aspen, showed a similar temporal pattern, but moose numbers peaked 10
   years later than aspen. During the same time period, the volume of aspen
   doubled.
   3. The changes in aspen abundance correlate to large-scale changes in
   forestry including the introduction of clear-cutting practices and
   extensive clearing of aspen, and cessation of forest livestock grazing
   and abandonment of marginal farmland.
   4. Using exclosures, and controlling for time since disturbance and
   regeneration status, we monitored aspen demographics for 5 years in an
   aspen rich landscape. There was an eightfold increase in recruitment
   rate of established ramets to a height safe from browsing (> 3 m) in
   fenced plots. However, the finite rate of increase, lambda, derived from
   a transition matrix model, was consistently below 1, i.e. the aspen
   growth rate was negative with or without browsing. This was associated
   with a decrease in sprouting rate over time.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that changes in land
   use practices are the main cause of changes in aspen abundance at
   regional and national scales in Sweden during the last 50 years.
   Restoring regeneration niches, most importantly emulating natural
   disturbance processes, viz. fire at various spatial scales, and
   retaining aspen in cleaning and pre-commercial thinnings are the most
   important management recommendations to secure regeneration of aspen.
   Protecting established aspen ramets at designated sites from browsing
   either by fencing or reducing ungulate numbers could be used as
   complementary management tools.}},

Abstract = {{Many forested steeplands in the western United States display a legacy
   of disturbances due to timber harvest, mining or wildfires, for example.
   Such disturbances have caused accelerated hillslope erosion, leading to
   increased sedimentation in fish-bearing streams. Several restoration
   techniques have been implemented to address these problems in mountain
   catchments, many of which involve the removal of abandoned roads and
   re-establishing drainage networks across road prisms. With limited
   restoration funds to be applied across large catchments, land managers
   are faced with deciding which areas and problems should be treated
   first, and by which technique, in order to design the most effective and
   cost-effective sediment reduction strategy. Currently most restoration
   is conducted on a site-specific scale according to uniform treatment
   policies. To create catchment-scale policies for restoration, we
   developed two optimization models - dynamic programming and genetic
   algorithms - to determine the most cost-effective treatment level for
   roads and stream crossings in a pilot study basin with approximately 700
   road segments and crossings. These models considered the trade-offs
   between the cost and effectiveness of different restoration strategies
   to minimize the predicted erosion from all forest roads within a
   catchment, while meeting a specified budget constraint. The optimal
   sediment reduction strategies developed by these models performed much
   better than two strategies of uniform erosion control which are commonly
   applied to road erosion problems by land managers, with sediment savings
   increased by an additional 48 to 80 per cent. These optimization models
   can be used to formulate the most cost-effective restoration policy for
   sediment reduction on a catchment scale. Thus, cost savings can be

Title = {{Effects of a fire-retardant chemical to fathead minnows in experimental
   streams}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{296-300}},
Abstract = {{Background. Each year millions of liters of fire-retardant chemicals are
   applied to wildfires across the nation. Recent laboratory studies with
   long-term fire-retardant chemicals indicate a significant photoenhanced
   toxicity of products containing sodium ferrocyanide corrosion
   inhibitors. Our objective of this study was to determine the toxicity of
   fire-retardant chemicals to fathead minnows during exposure in
   experimental outdoor streams.
   Methods. Stream tests were conducted to determine the potential toxicity
   of a pulse of exposure as might occur when fire retardant chemical is
   rinsed from the watershed by rainfall. Two artificial 55-meter
   experimental streams were dosed with different concentrations of
   Fire-Trol(R) GTS-R, or uncontaminated for a control. Replicate groups of
   fathead minnows were added to screened containers (10 fish per
   container) and exposed to retardant chemicals in the recirculating flow
   of the stream for up to 6 hours.
   Results and Discussion. Under field conditions toxicity of GTS-R only
   occurred in the presence of sunlight. When GTS-R was tested on sunny
   days, 100\% mortality occurred. However, when tested during heavily
   overcast conditions, no mortality occurred.
   Conclusions. Lethal concentrations of cyanide were measured when GTS-R
   with YPS exposures were conducted under sunny conditions, but not under
   cloudy conditions, indicating that a minimum UV level is necessary to
   induce toxicity as well as the release of cyanide from YPS. The toxicity
   observed with GTS-R was likely associated with lethal concentrations of
   cyanide. Rainwater runoff following applications of this fire-retardant
   at the recommended rate could result in lethal concentrations in small
   ponds and streams receiving limited water flow under sunny conditions.
   Recommendations and Outlook. In addition to avoiding application to
   aquatic habitats, it is important to consider characteristics of the
   treated site including soil binding affinity and erosive properties.}},

Abstract = {{Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are threatened in Canada,
   with population and distribution declines evident in most regions of the
   country. Causes of declines are linked to landscape change from forest
   fires and human development, notably forestry oil and gas activities,
   which result in caribou habitat loss and affect ecosystem food webs. The
   Federal Species at Risk Act requires effective protection and
   restoration of caribou habitat, with actions to increase caribou
   survival. These requirements call for effective monitoring of caribou
   population trends to gauge success. Many woodland caribou populations
   are nearly impossible to count using traditional aerial survey methods,
   but demographic-based monitoring approaches can be used to estimate
   population trends based on population modeling of vital rates from
   marked animals. Monitoring programs have used a well-known simple
   population model (the Recruitment-Mortality {[}R/M] equation) to
   estimate demographic rates for woodland caribou, but have faced
   challenges in managing large data streams and providing transparency in
   the demographic estimation process. We present a stand-alone statistical
   software application using open-source software to permit efficient,
   transparent, and replicable demographic estimation for woodland caribou
   populations. We developed an easy-to-use, interactive web-based
   application for the R/M population model that uses a Bayesian estimation
   approach and provides the user flexibility in choice of prior
   distributions and other output features. We illustrate the
   web-application to the A la Peche Southern Mountain (Central Group)
   woodland caribou population in west-central Alberta, Canada, during
   1998-2017. Our estimates of population demographics are consistent with
   previous research on this population and highlight the utility of the
   application in assessing caribou population responses to species
   recovery actions. We provide example data, computer code, the web-based
   application package, and a user manual to guide installation and use. We
   also review underlying assumptions and challenges of population
   monitoring in this case study. We expect our software will contribute to
   efficient monitoring of woodland caribou and help in the assessment of
   recovery actions for this species. (c) 2019 The Authors. Wildlife

Abstract = {{Early postfire habitats harbour numerous saproxylic species. Some are
   opportunistic feeders, while others are closely associated with burned
   forests. This distinction is important for developing sound postfire
   forest management aimed at conserving biodiversity, as concerns should
   be mostly directed towards burn-associated saproxylic beetles rather
   than opportunistic species. Here, we examine species-habitat
   associations, temporal dynamics, and community structure of saproxylic
   beetles in black spruce and jack pine stands disturbed by wildfire and
   by a ``non-fire{''} disturbance generated by girdling trees to mimic the
   small-scale gap dynamics characterizing old-growth boreal forests in
   Canada. We used flight-interception traps and reared logs to compare
   abundance, species richness, and species composition of saproxylic
   beetles among treatments. We found that over 30\% of saproxylic beetles
   had an affinity with jack pine or black spruce affected by either fire
   or girdling. Assemblages consistently differed between disturbance types
   over the 3 y of the study. We found that successional changes in species
   composition were more pronounced in burned sites than those with the
   girdling treatment, which indicates that the contribution of
   fire-generated habitats to regional diversity increases over time. While
   postfire forests are notable for their early-colonizing saproxylic
   species, our results show that they can also have substantial value for
   supporting mid-successional species such as Acmaeops pratensis, which is
   already on European red lists. This forewarns us about long-term
   negative consequences that postfire salvage logging could have for
   certain species.}},

Title = {{Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{445-457}},

Abstract = {{1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and
   freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat
   quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's
   riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions
   they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their
   ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore
   the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we
   lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in
   riparian zones.
   2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how
   trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead),
   fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological
   value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified
   where and with which species current research is being undertaken and
   examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location,
   focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand
   potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to
   changes in riparian zones.
   3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant
   peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included
   in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate
   response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered
   riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We
   used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific
   trout responses to eight key `drivers' of change in riparian condition.
   4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact
   designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to
   riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the
   literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and
   forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or
   individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond
   positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and
   +66.6\% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation
   (-67.4 and -88.2\% respectively). We found some evidence that positive
   riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or
   density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e.
   individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to
   be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on
   the `production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial.
   5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation
   activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More
   generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these
   key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and
   trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring
   programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using
   BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are
   required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically,
   socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even
   more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish
   species.}},

   squared distance between sample variates in the GIS database (forest
   cover type, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to streams, distance to
   roads, and forest cover richness) and variates at known beat dens. Two
   models were developed: a generalized model for all den locations and
   another specific to dens in rock cavities. Differences between habitat
   at den sites and habitat across the study area were represented in 2 new
   GIS themes as Mahalanobis distance values. Cells similar to the mean
   Vector derived from the known dens had low Mahalanobis distance values,
   and dissimilar cells had high values. The reliability of the predictive
   model was tested by overlaying den locations collected subsequent to
   original model development on the resultant den habitat themes. Although
   the generalized model demonstrated poor reliability, the model specific
   to rock dens had good reliability. Bears were more likely to choose rock
   den locations with low Mahalanobis distance values and less likely to

Abstract = {{The precipitation history of south-west Australia since the Last Glacial
   Maximum (LGM) has important implications for understanding southern
   hemisphere climate dynamics. Previously reported environmental records
   indicating more open vegetation during the LGM have been interpreted in
   terms of aridity, but such changes can be explained by alternative
   mechanisms. To provide new evidence concerning the region's Quaternary
   precipitation history, we examine temporal changes in large mammal
   richness at four south-west Australian fossil sites: Devil's Lair,
   Tunnel Cave, Witchcliffe Rock Shelter and Rainbow Cave. Large mammal
   richness is correlated strongly with mean annual precipitation across 53
   modern Australian communities. Extending this relationship to the fossil
   record, a steady increase in richness from the LGM to the onset of the
   Holocene at both Devil's Lair and Tunnel Cave is consistent with
   increased precipitation through time. This supports previous
   interpretations of a more arid LGM and implies regional heterogeneity in
   the position of the southern hemisphere westerlies. A reduction in
   richness during the last similar to 1000 years is unlikely to be the
   result of precipitation change and may be related to more frequent
   burning of the landscape by hunter-gatherers in an effort to increase
   availability of large prey. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance regimes of arid regions throughout the world are changing
   along with global warming. Severity of drought associated with decreased
   stream discharge and increased frequency and intensity of wildfires are
   increasing in many of these systems. Combined, these factors can have
   potentially devastating effects on stream fish communities. To quantify
   the response of fish communities to annual variation in climate,
   hydrology, and wildfire, we used long-term and spatially extensive
   datasets from the Gila River drainage, NM, U.S.A. Additionally, we
   tracked the recovery of multiple fish communities within the study area
   following extreme drought and associated wildfires that occurred between
   2011 and 2013. Twenty-nine years of monitoring at six sites, beginning
   in 1988, indicated that fish community richness and density were
   negatively associated with drought, as quantified by the Palmer Drought
   Severity Index. Ordination of fish species densities across these sites
   further suggested that native species were more sensitive to
   inter-annual variation in climate than non-native fishes. The resistance
   and resilience of fishes to drought and ash flows following the most
   severe series of wildfires on record between 2011 and 2013 were highly
   variable across sites and species. The percent of common species that
   were able to resist a significant decline ranged from 0 to 70\%,
   depending on location. As of 2017, all but two species (one native and
   one non-native) had recovered at one or more sites. Although we
   hypothesised that the response to wildfire and drought that occurred
   between 2011 and 2013 should vary with body size and species provenance
   (native or non-native), this was not supported. Rather, resistance of
   fish communities to these events appeared to be driven primarily by
   spatial factors, such as intensity of disturbance, and resilience was
   driven by species ability to rapidly rebound from severely depressed
   numbers or immigrate from nearby refuge populations. Current climate
   trends suggest an increase in the intensity of disturbance associated
   with wildfire and drought; thus, maintenance of native biodiversity
   should focus on preservation of habitat integrity and connectivity among
   habitats that allows for recolonisation of disturbed habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The Oklahoma Dispersion Model (ODM) represents a current innovative
   application of the classic Gaussian plume model in an operational
   setting. Utilizing a statewide mesoscale automated weather station
   network (the Oklahoma Mesonet) for current weather conditions and 60-h
   gridded Nested Grid Model (NGM) model output statistics (MOS) forecasts
   for future conditions, the ODM is an Internet-based management tool that
   can be used to qualitatively assess current and future atmospheric
   dispersion conditions across Oklahoma for near-surface releases of gases
   and small particulates. The ODM is designed to qualitatively assess
   concentrations at ground level near the plume centerline at downwind
   distances of up to 4000 m. The Gaussian plume model is used in
   conjunction with rural Briggs sigma-y and sigma-z coefficients to
   estimate horizontal and vertical dispersion. Pasquill stability class is
   calculated in two ways: for current conditions, Oklahoma Mesonet weather
   data are used in conjunction with algorithms recommended by the
   Environmental Protection Agency; for forecast conditions, the Turner
   method is used. A method is employed that breaks the atmosphere into six
   dispersion categories, ranging from excellent to very poor. The ODM
   generates both graphical and text output. Statewide colored maps showing
   current conditions for dispersion (dilution of plume) and transport
   (direction of plume movement) are generated every 15 and 5 min,
   respectively. Similar maps for future conditions are generated every 12
   h using gridded 60-h NGM MOS forecasts. In addition to graphical output,
   tabular output for future conditions at specific MOS locations is

Abstract = {{Mediterranean forests art, characterised by a remarkable set of features
   that make them naturally and aesthetically attractive, on the one hand,
   but also quite fragile, on the other, therefore calling for careful
   strategies for their conservation and management. An exceptionally large
   variation of environmental conditions characterises the Mediterranean
   countries, where the environment can limit forest growth and succession
   but can also give rise, more often than it is supposed, to lush, mesic
   forest ecosystems, similar to those of central Europe. Moreover,
   Mediterranean forests contain an ample, plant and animal biological
   diversity, exemplified by the large number of tree species as compared
   to Nordic forests, and by their relatively high genetic variability due
   to the survival of many conifer and broadleaf species in southern
   European refuges, during the glacial periods. Another peculiar aspect of
   this region is the long-lasting manipulation of trees, forests and
   landscapes, since ancient times, with the diffusion all over the
   Mediterranean basin of such species as Pinus pinea, Cupressus
   sempervirens, Castanea sativa, and Quercus suber. The harsh and
   unpredictable climate, the difficult socio-economic conditions and the
   history of over-exploitation of the Mediterranean forests require that a
   scientifically sound conservation strategy and a locally-tailored
   sustainable management should be implemented. In particular, the need
   for identifying those silvicultural and management strategies
   appropriate for southern European forests should be stressed. Obviously,
   this consideration will have important effects on the definition of
   criteria for sustainability and eco-certification, Also, social issues
   should be considered key factors for effective forest conservation in
   the Mediterranean region, otherwise it will be impossible to control
   forest fires and landscape degradation.
   Based on these considerations a number of research priorities are
   discussed, with special consideration to possible impacts that global
   change may have on Mediterranean forest ecosystems. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Research on herbaceous vegetation restoration in forests
   characterised by overstorey tree harvests, excessive deer herbivory, and
   a dominant fern understorey is lacking. Most of the plant diversity
   found in Eastern hardwood forests in the United States is found in the
   herbaceous understorey layer. Loss of forest herbaceous species is an
   indicator of declining forest conditions.
   Aims: The combined effects of deer herbivory, competitive understorey
   vegetation removal, and overstorey tree removal on the abundance and
   reproductive capacity of three understorey herbs in the Liliaceae family
   were evaluated.
   Methods: A split-plot randomised block design was used with three
   replicates. Treatments included three harvest intensities,
   fenced/unfenced, herbicide/no herbicide-treated, prescribed burn/no
   prescribed burn, and all combinations. A generalised linear model was
   used to compare treatment effects over 8 years.
   Results: Both fruit production and cover increased significantly in
   fenced areas for all three species. There was a significant 6-year
   recovery period for cover of the three species in response to herbicide.
   There was a significant 4-year recovery period of fire-treated plots for
   fruit production of the three species. The most intensively cut, fenced,
   and herbicide-treated plots had the greatest increases in sapling and
   Rubus spp. cover. Cover and fruit production of the three herbs were
   significantly greatest in the moderate-cut treatment.
   Conclusions: Restoration of these three liliaceous species is most
   likely to occur in Eastern deciduous forests and similar forests using a
   combined fenced and moderate-cut treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Population declines of several successional-scrub bird species are

   Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because
   of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive
   sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce
   following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods
   are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally
   tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands
   to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak
   regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak
   shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and
   controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons

   18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW
   had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created
   habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature
   forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally,
   we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more
   individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding
   closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by
   enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of
   several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our

Abstract = {{Ecological disturbance and climate are key drivers of temporal dynamics
   in the demography and genetic diversity of natural populations.
   Microscale refuges are known to buffer species' persistence against
   environmental change, but the effects of such refuges on demographic and
   genetic patterns in response to short-term environmental variation are
   poorly understood. We quantified demographic and genetic responses of
   mountain brushtail possums (Trichosurus cunninghami) to rainfall
   variability (1992-2013) and to a major wildfire. We hypothesized that
   there would be underlying differences in demographic and genetic
   processes between an unburnt mesic refuge and a topographically exposed
   zone that was burnt in 2009. Fire caused a 2-year decrease in survival
   in the burnt zone, but the population grew after the fire due to
   immigration, leading to increased expected heterozygosity. We documented
   a fire-related behavioural shift, where the rate of movement by
   individuals in the unburnt refuge to the burnt zone decreased after
   fire. Irrespective of the fire, there were long-term differences in
   demographic and genetic parameters between the mesic/unburnt refuge and
   the nonmesic/burnt zone. Survival was high and unaffected by rainfall in
   the refuge, but lower and rainfall-dependent in the nonmesic zone. Net
   movement of individuals was directional, from the mesic refuge to the
   nonmesic zone, suggesting fine-scale source-sink dynamics. There were
   higher expected heterozygosity (H-E) and temporal genetic stability in
   the refuge, but lower H-E and marked temporal genetic structure in the
   exposed habitat, consistent with reduced generational overlap caused by
   elevated mortality and immigration. Thus, fine-scale refuges can mediate
   the short-term demographic and genetic effects of climate and ecological
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Mortalities to Acacia drepanolobium, a main item in the diet of the

   monitoring survival and growth in experimental plots before and after
   fire episodes between 2003 and 2007. Density, survival and growth in A.
   drepanolobium trees were compared eighteen months before and after
   burning. Tall trees were more likely to die from fire compared to short
   trees (R2 = 0.575; df = 6; P = 0.048), while seedling densities
   increased after fire (chi 2 = 36.57; df = 1; P = 0.001). Even with
   increased seedling densities, burned areas attracted large numbers of
   seedling predators, lowering the possibility of seedling recruitment
   into adult, as mean seedling heights reduced significantly (ANOVA, F =

   the most significant effect was tree reversals into seedling height

Abstract = {{Invasive woody plant expansion is a primary threat driving fragmentation
   and loss of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and prairie habitats across the
   central and western United States. Expansion of native woody plants,
   including conifer (primarily Juniperus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis
   spp.), over the past century is primarily attributable to wildfire
   suppression, historic periods of intensive livestock grazing, and
   changes in climate. To guide successful conservation programs aimed at
   reducing top-down stressors, we mapped invasive woody plants at regional
   scales to evaluate landscape level impacts, target restoration actions,
   and monitor restoration outcomes. Our overarching goal was to produce
   seamless regional products across sociopolitical boundaries with
   resolution fine enough to depict the spatial extent and degree of woody
   plant invasion relevant to greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus) and lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus)
   conservation efforts. We mapped tree canopy cover at 1-m spatial
   resolution across an 11-state region (508 265 km(2)). Greater than 90\%
   of occupied lesser prairie-chicken habitat was largely treeless for
   conifers (<1\% canopy cover), whereas > 67\% was treeless for mesquite.
   Conifers in the higher canopy cover classes (16-50\% and >50\% canopy
   cover) were scarce (<2\% and 1\% canopy cover), as was mesquite (<5\%
   and 1\% canopy cover). Occupied habitat by sage-grouse was more variable
   but also had a relatively large proportion of treeless areas ((x) over
   bar = 71, SE = 5\%). Low to moderate levels of conifer cover (1-20\%)
   were fewer ((x) over bar = 23, SE = 5\%) as were areas in the highest
   cover class (>50\%; (x) over bar = 6, SE = 2\%). Mapping indicated that
   a high proportion of invading woody plants are at a low to intermediate
   level. Canopy cover maps for conifer and mesquite resulting from this
   study provide the first and most geographically complete,
   high-resolution assessment of woody plant cover as a top-down threat to
   western sage-steppe and prairie ecosystems. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Uneven-aged silviculture is increasingly viewed as ecologically and
   economically appropriate strategy to manage forest ecosystems.
   Consequently, there is interest in converting intensively managed pine
   plantations to uneven aged stands in the southeastern United States.
   Understanding biophysical factors that determine performance and growth
   of desirable species is critical to success of such conversions. We
   initiated a replicated, long-term, operational-scale stand conversion
   experiment in mature slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantations in
   mesicwet flatwoods sites in northwest Florida, and examined how five
   conversion harvests (shelterwood, group selection, staggered third row
   thin, third row thin, cut 2 leave 3 thin harvests), in addition to an
   uncut control, affected understory light availability in these forests.
   Light availability was measured in terms of leaf area index, sky, and
   fractions of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (both direct
   and diffuse). The values of these variables were derived by analyzing a
   total of 880 (450 in the harvest treatment plots and additional 430 in
   the gaps of group selection) Digital Hemispherical Photographs using
   image analyzing software CAN-EYE. We found that shelterwood harvest
   resulted in highest light availability, whereas greatest variability in
   light conditions was observed following group selection harvests. Among
   the four circular gap sizes (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 ha) we studied, gaps
   of larger sizes had greater light availability. Light availability
   increased as the distance from the gap edge increased and was highest
   either in the center of the gap or slightly towards northern and western
   sides of the gap center. Variability in light availability increased as
   gap size increased from 0.1 to 0.4 ha but was reduced in the 0.8 ha gap.
   In shade-intolerant species like slash pine in wet flatwoods where soil
   moisture and nutrients are generally not limiting light availability
   could be the most critical factor determining the success of
   regeneration and stand conversion. Overall, the results indicated that
   shelterwood harvest resulted in highest average light availability which
   would be conducive to slash pine regeneration while group selection
   harvest created the most diverse light environment during the stand
   conversion which may promote a broader diversity of groundcover species.
   Long-term monitoring of regeneration growth and recruitment following
   prescribed burning and over multiple cutting cycles will determine if
   slash pine can be sustainably managed using uneven aged silviculture.}},

Abstract = {{Western rangelands are currently under severe threat from exotic annual
   grasses. To successfully manage rangelands that are either infested with

   Young) rangelands that focuses on increasing resilience to fire and
   resistance to exotic annual grasses through the maintenance of perennial
   bunchgrasses. By maintaining perennial bunchgrass, exotic annual grasses
   have limited resources, thus decreasing the invasibility of the site. In
   order for the fuel-based model to be effective in guiding landmanagement
   practices, research that evaluates the interactions between biotic and

Abstract = {{This paper puts forward the thesis that, in order to produce useful
   ecological inventory approaches that satisfy the requirement for
   integration at different scales and between different ecosystem
   components, the integration of ecosystem properties must occur as a
   fundamental component of the map units, i.e., as a part of the
   classification system. Other ecosystem components can be related to the
   integrated ecosystem classification following delineation of the basic
   ecosystem units. This presentation demonstrates this approach using
   Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (Pojar et ctl. 1987) concepts in
   three watersheds in coastal British Columbia.
   The approach of the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification is to
   utilize phyto-sociological concepts to interpret and classify
   ecosystems. Plant community-derived ecosystem classes are then related
   to physical environmental components based on detailed field
   descriptions of site and soil properties. In this way the integration of
   the complex of environmental factors is interpreted for three
   fundamental properties-climate, soil moisture, and soil nutrients. Using
   this approach, biologically-significant boundaries in regional and local
   ecological gradients can be identified and used to link the
   classification to the landscape. The same approach is used to derive
   classes for ecosystem succession with the site classification. In
   British Columbia, regional (Biogeoclimatic Zones, Subzones, and
   Variants), local(Site Associations, Site Series and Site Types), and
   chronological(Seral Associations) scale ecosystems have been classified
   within a hierarchical framework. The result is a natural (taxonomic)
   classification that can be interpreted for a wide range of purposes,
   including wildlife capability and suitability, forest productivity (site
   index), forest health, soil conservation, riparian management, and
   biodiversity inventory.
   This presentation demonstrates the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem
   Classification approach to ecosystem inventory by reporting on the
   Greater Vancouver Regional District Ecosystem Inventory presently being
   carried out in three 20,000 ha watersheds that provide drinking water to
   the city of Vancouver, Canada. The project has been ongoing for about 5
   years, and has involved a team of scientists including a hydrologist,
   terrain scientist, ecologist, forest inventory specialist, forest health
   specialist, and forest fire specialist. Complete, inter-related
   inventories of these watersheds have been completed and maps will show
   interpretations derived from the different ecosystem components. The
   inventory is linked to a landscape model, which as a number of
   inter-related components, including sediment recruitment and delivery,
   landslides and soil erosion, forest succession, forest pests, and forest
   De hazard. The model is being used in conjunction with the ecological
   inventory to compare the impacts on water quality and biodiversity of
   three different management options over a 200 year planning horizon. The
   model and inventory is used to compare, for the three management
   approaches, water quality impacts (changes in annual fine sediment
   delivery to the reservoir) of potential watershed disturbances,
   including a large fire and a major insect outbreak. Future work involves
   determining the applicability of the model for deriving global warming
   effects, and the long term impacts of air pollution on water quality and
   ecosystem resources.}},

   we monitored radiocollared female (n=73) white-tailed deer in the
   central Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. Natural mortality
   (i.e., from coyotes {[}Canus latrans], dogs, malnutrition, sickness, and
   unknown causes) (n=44, 71\%) was the primary cause of female mortality,
   followed by harvest (n=14, 22.6\%) and accidental causes (i.e., road
   kill and drowning) (n=4, 6.5\%). More females died in spring (n=33,
   53.2\%) than in fall (n=14, 22.6\%), winter (n=9, 14.5\%), or summer
   (n=6, 9.7\%). For the entire study period (1993-1996), survival rate for
   female white-tailed deer was 10.4\%. Annual survival rates of females
   ranged from 50.3 to 62.1\% and were similar among years (P=0.743).
   Intraseasonal survival rates for females differed between winter
   (P=0.003) and spring (P=0.014), whereas summer (P=0.073) and fall
   (P=0.404) were similar. High spring mortality of females was related to
   poor forage conditions on winter range and limited escape cover
   throughout the central Black Hills. We recommend the use of management
   techniques that promote overstory and understory plant diversity, such
   as aspen (Populus tremuloides) regeneration and prescribed burns, to
   improve the habitat in this region.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the results of a 3-year field study of the effects
   of spring/summer burning and cattle grazing on wintering sparrows in the
   grasslands of southeastern Arizona. The effects of fire were studied
   with 1 year of pre-burn data and 1 year of post-burn data from 1 fire,
   plus limited sampling from a second fire at Buenos Aires National
   Wildlife Refuge in Pima County, Ariz, The effects of grazing were
   studied by comparing study plots at a site that has not been grazed by
   cattle since 1968 with a nearby grazed pasture in Santa Cruz County,
   Ar;iz. Sparrow abundance was measured as the number of captures from
   flushnetting sessions conducted by groups of 13-30 volunteers. Vesper
   (Pocecetes gramineus (Gmelin)) and Savannah (Passerculus sandwichensis
   (Gmelin)) Sparrows responded positively to fire, while Cassin's Sparrows
   (Aimophila cassinhi (Woodhouse)) responded negatively. The ecologically
   and geographically restricted Baird's (Ammodramus baridil (Audubon)) and
   Grasshopper (A. savannarum (Gmelin)) Sparrows utilized burned areas
   during the first post-burn winter and did not significantly respond to
   fire. Both Ammodramus sparrows also utilized the grazed pasture; they
   were more abundant there than in the ungrazed study area in 1 year.
   While field observations and a prior study suggest that heavy grazing
   can have a strong detrimental effect on Ammodramus sparrows, the results
   of this study suggest that moderate cattle grazing may be compatible
   with the conservation of these species.}},

Abstract = {{Trees killed by natural disturbances have been recognized by the
   International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a promising resource for
   bioenergy at the global scale. In the eastern boreal forest of Canada,
   there are two major types of natural disturbances that can generate
   large amounts of biomass for the production of bioenergy: wildfire and
   spruce budworm outbreak. For example, the mean burned area between 1970
   and 2010 was estimated at 2900 km(2) per year. Following such
   disturbances, typically only trees and stands with a merchantable value,
   i.e., of acceptable quality for traditional forest products (lumber and
   pulp) are salvaged. However, adding bioenergy to the potential basket of
   products may both divert trees of marginal quality and profitability
   away from traditional products and to bioenergy facilities and lengthen
   the window of opportunity during which salvage operations can occur.
   This review shows how the dynamics of wood characteristics of trees
   affected by natural disturbances can be used to predict through time the
   basket of wood products that can be taken out of a salvaged stand and
   ensure the best fit between sources of fibre and types of processing
   facilities. The most important factors influencing fibre quality include
   degradation caused by fungi and insects. The most suitable time to
   salvage trees for the production of lumber in stands killed by either
   spruce budworm or fire is generally limited to 1-2 years after death.
   For the production of pulp and paper, trees can usually be salvaged for
   as long as the wood moisture content remains above the fibre saturation
   point, but usually is not recommended after 3 or 4 years following
   death. Thus, past this period, salvaged trees may yield better
   opportunities for the bioenergy sector. Information on wood as bioenergy
   feedstock (wood chips, wood pellets and liquid biofuel) highlights the
   importance of wood chemical components in the chemical reactivity of
   biofuel. This study offers background knowledge and a framework of
   analysis that highlights the potential of dead wood from natural
   disturbances for the production of forest and bioenergy products, which
   can be further adapted to other regions of the world, building on the
   Canadian experience of adapting practices to natural disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean region is projected to be extremely vulnerable to
   global change, which will affect the distribution of typical forest
   types such as native oak forests. However, our understanding of
   Mediterranean oak forest responses to future conditions is still very
   limited by the lack of knowledge on oak forest dynamics and
   species-specific responses to multiple drivers. We compared the
   long-term (1966-2006) forest persistence and land cover change among
   evergreen (cork oak and holm oak) and deciduous oak forests and
   evaluated the importance of anthropogenic and environmental drivers on
   observed changes for Portugal. We used National Forest Inventories to
   quantify the changes in oak forests and explored the drivers of change
   using multinomial logistic regression analysis and an information
   theoretical approach. We found distinct trends among oak forest types,
   reflecting the differences in oak economic value, protection status and
   management schemes: cork oak forests were the most persistent (62\%),
   changing mostly to pines and eucalypt; holm oak forests were less
   persistent (53.2\%), changing mostly to agriculture; and deciduous oak
   forests were the least persistent (45.7\%), changing mostly to
   shrublands. Drivers of change had distinct importance across oak forest
   types, but drivers from anthropogenic origin (wildfires, population
   density, and land accessibility) were always among the most important.
   Climatic extremes were also important predictors of oak forest changes,
   namely extreme temperatures for evergreen oak forests and deficit of
   precipitation for deciduous oak forests. Our results indicate that under
   increasing human pressure and forecasted climate change, evergreen oak
   forests will continue declining and deciduous oak forests will be
   replaced by forests dominated by more xeric species. In the long run,
   multiple disturbances may change competitive dominance from oak forests
   to pyrophytic shrublands. A better understanding of forest dynamics and
   the inclusion of anthropogenic drivers on models of vegetation change
   will improve predicting the future of Mediterranean oak forests.}},

Title = {{Seed and seedling ecology of pinon and juniper species in the pygmy
   woodlands of western North America}},
Journal = {{BOTANICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-38}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of the seed and seedling ecology of the pinon and juniper
   woodlands of western North America is essential for understanding both
   the northward migration and expansion of the woodlands during the
   Holocene (<11,500 B.P.), and the accelerated expansion of the woodlands
   since settlement of the West by Anglo-Americans around 200 years ago. We
   follow the fates of seeds and seedlings of the different pinon and
   juniper species within the woodlands from seed development to seedling
   establishment, and discuss the implications of this information for the
   past and present expansion of the woodlands. While seed development
   requires about two and one-half years in pinons, it is species-dependent
   in junipers and can take one, two, or even three years. Substantial seed
   lasses can occur during seed development due to developmental
   constraints, and before or after seed maturation as a result of insects,
   pathogens, or predatory animals. In pinon pines, the primary seed
   dispersers are scatter-hoarding birds (corvids) and rodents that harvest
   seeds from the trees or after seed fall and cache them in the soil. In
   contrast, most junipers appear to be dispersed primarily by frugivorous
   birds and mammals that ingest the seeds and defecate them onto the soil
   surface. We have recently documented that scatter-hoarding rodents also
   disperse juniper seeds. Disperser effectiveness, or the contribution a
   disperser makes to the future reproduction of a plant population, may
   vary among species of pinons and especially junipers. Pinon seeds are
   short-lived and exhibit little dormancy, and they probably only
   germinate the spring following dispersal. Juniper seeds are long-lived
   and seed dispersal can occur over one or more years. Seed germination
   can be delayed for several years due to impermeable seed coats, embryo
   dormancy, or the presence of inhibitors. Seedling establishment of pinon
   pines is facilitated by nurse plants but, while junipers often establish
   beneath nurse plants, they are capable of establishing in open
   environments. In the southwestern United States, higher establishment of
   juniper occurs in open environments due to more favorable precipitation,
   and competition may be more important than facilitation in determining
   establishment.
   When considering the mechanisms involved in the past and present
   expansion of the woodlands, short-distance dispersal, local population
   growth, and long-distance dispersal are all important. Different classes
   of dispersers, some of which appear to have coevolved with the tree
   species, appear to be responsible for local (short-distance) vs.
   long-distance dispersal in pinons and junipers. Because ecotones form
   the interface between the woodlands and adjacent communities, they can
   provide valuable information on both the seed dispersal and seedling
   establishment processes responsible for tree expansion.
   Disturbance regimes and, recently, the effects of humans on those
   regimes have major effects on the expansion and contraction of the
   woodlands. Before Anglo-American settlement, fires occurred as
   frequently as every 50-100 years throughout much of the woodlands.
   During this century, fire frequencies have been reduced due to the
   indirect effects of livestock grazing and the direct effects of removing
   Native Americans from the ecosystem and implementing active
   fire-prevention programs. The result has been an increase in
   tree-dominated successional stages at the expense of grass-dominated
   stages. Various management techniques, including controlled burning and
   chaining, have been implemented to reduce tree dominance, but their
   effects depend largely on the life histories of the tree species and the
   disturbance characteristics. Several areas relating to the seed and
   seedling ecology of the pinon and juniper require additional research if
   we are to truly understand the dynamics of the woodlands.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-47}},
Abstract = {{Many lakeside Phragmites australis reeds are frequently harvested or
   burnt in winter for several purposes like extraction of raw material,
   natural preservation or facilitation of professional fishing or fish
   breeding. The question is, whether these practices support a sustainable
   development of the reeds. Data from a long term monitoring program at
   Lake Constance (Germany) demonstrate that culm morphology, stand
   structure and aboveground peak biomass are strongly influenced by the
   treatment. Winter harvested and burnt reeds exhibited higher culm
   densities (+76\% of the untreated controls), and a higher peak biomass
   (+13\%). The mean culm height was reduced by -13\%. The percentage of
   insect infested shoots was 8.8\% of the total shoot population compared
   with 20.1\% of the untreated controls. Consecutive harvesting treatments
   intensified these effects. In the first two years after the treatment
   had stopped the reed stands showed an `overshoot' biomass production,
   and a strong trend towards the features of the untreated controls. The
   possible mechanisms (mechanical damage, frost kill of the growth tips
   and breaking of the apical dominance) are discussed. It is concluded
   that winter harvesting and burning treatments make the reeds more
   susceptible against some environmental hazards, and should therefore
   applied with precaution on the basis of a close examination of risks and
   benefits.}},

Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{475-485}},

Abstract = {{Resources are seldom distributed equally across space, but many species
   exhibit spatially synchronous population dynamics. Such synchrony
   suggests the operation of large-scale external drivers, such as rainfall
   or wildfire, or the influence of oasis sites that provide water,
   shelter, or other resources. However, testing the generality of these
   factors is not easy, especially in variable environments. Using a
   long-term dataset (13-22 years) from a large (8000 km(2)) study region
   in arid Central Australia, we tested firstly for regional synchrony in
   annual rainfall and the dynamics of six reptile species across nine
   widely separated sites. For species that showed synchronous spatial
   dynamics, we then used multivariate follow a multivariate
   auto-regressive state-space (MARSS) models to predict that regional
   rainfall would be positively associated with their populations. For
   asynchronous species, we used MARSS models to explore four other
   possible population structures: (1) populations were asynchronous, (2)
   differed between oasis and non-oasis sites, (3) differed between burnt
   and unburnt sites, or (4) differed between three sub-regions with
   different rainfall gradients. Only one species showed evidence of
   spatial population synchrony and our results provide little evidence
   that rainfall synchronizes reptile populations. The oasis or the
   wildfire hypotheses were the best-fitting models for the other five
   species. Thus, our six study species appear generally to be structured
   in space into one or two populations across the study region. Our
   findings suggest that for arid-dwelling reptile populations, spatial and
   temporal dynamics are structured by abiotic events, but individual
   responses to covariates at smaller spatial scales are complex and poorly
   understood.}},

Abstract = {{Leucaena leucocephala subsp. leucocephala was introduced to Hawaii after

   common in disturbed areas, it is much less common in intact native dry
   forests. It is resilient to wildfire and mammalian grazing, which
   conversely threaten the integrity of remnant native dryland forest. The
   successional trajectory of areas dominated by leucaena has not been well
   studied in Hawaii, but it is probable that other non-native rather than
   native species will replace it. As a result of its widespread
   distribution, especially on steep slopes, priority for its eradication
   or control is low. Current biocontrol options are limited in
   effectiveness. Control of leucaena can and should be given greater
   priority to protect native dryland forests and inhibit spread of seeds.

Abstract = {{In the five-year period from 2001 to 2006, 48 monitoring grids
   comprising the FORESTCHECK initiative were established in open eucalypt
   (jarrah, Eucalyptus marginata) forest in south-west Western Australia.
   Since 1985, revised silvicultural objectives have necessitated detailed
   monitoring of responses by bird species and assemblages to silvicultural
   treatments (timber harvesting and associated burning). Few marked
   changes in the avifauna were detected. Species accumulated (in terms of
   numbers of grids) at similar rates in gap release, shelterwood
   /selective cut, and reference (either never harvested or harvested more
   than 40 years previously) forests. In terms of individuals, species
   accumulated faster in the gap release forests. The number of species
   represented as singletons was greatest on the never harvested (8), coupe
   buffer (7) and gap release (6) grids. Dominance-diversity curves also
   showed only minor differences between silvicultural treatments. Neither
   nMDS nor CAP ordinations showed any clear separation between the
   treatments. There was little evidence of any substantial effect of
   silvicultural treatments on avian community structure or on individual
   bird species. Community structure was, however, significantly associated
   with forest ecosystem/year of sampling. The basal area of live trees was
   not correlated with bird species richness or abundance on each grid.
   These results are consistent with previous studies, which indicate that
   most bird species in jarrah forest have a high threshold level of
   tolerance to disturbance. It is likely that the rapid regeneration of
   dominant tree species after harvesting and associated fire, the
   patchiness of treatments at the landscape scale, the high degree of
   connectivity of harvested and burnt forests with forests not recently
   harvested or burnt, and the retention of habitat trees in the most
   heavily-harvested (gap release) forests all conduce to dampen
   local-scale impacts and conserve the avifauna in relation to the home
   range and normal movements of its constituent bird species.}},

Abstract = {{Commencing in 2009, Meat and Livestock Australia has funded the Northern
   Grazing Systems Project (NGS) which seeks to identify and extend
   sustainable herd and land management strategies for nine major
   bio-regions of northern Australia. Conduct of the NGS is built around a
   multi-step framework of scientific reviews, regional industry workshops,
   bio-economic modelling of the impact of the most promising `best-bet'
   options on landscape degradation and production, and regional testing
   and extension of those options.
   Bio-economic modelling is a central component of NGS and has been
   applied to exploring the production, resource condition and financial
   implications of northern beef enterprises adopting the more promising
   strategies that are revealed through the science review and workshop
   phases. The modelling process combines a pasture and animal production
   model (GRASP) and a dynamic beef herd economic model (ENTERPRISE) to
   mimic the performance of representative beef enterprises defined at each
   regional workshop.
   NGS is exploring four major herd and management strategies across the
   regions, including:
   (a) Stocking rates,
   (b) Wet season pasture spelling,
   (c) Prescribed fire, and
   (d) Infrastructure.
   The paper briefly describes the overall NGS framework and illustrates
   the application of the modelling process for one of the herd and
   management strategies, namely stocking rates, in one of the nine
   bio-regions, the Fitzroy River Basin.
   The effect of employing variable versus fixed stocking rate strategies
   on a range of physical (carrying capacity, pasture condition, animal
   growth) and financial (total enterprise profit) measures is explored for
   a hypothetical 10,500 ha property located at Duaringa. The stocking rate
   strategies include set stocking rates and two variable stocking rates
   that involve either constrained or unlimited variation in response to
   pasture availability.
   The economic results favoured a set stocking strategy over either of the
   two variable stocking rate strategies. While the unlimited variation

Abstract = {{At the broadest spatial scales, the distribution of south Florida slash
   pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa Little and Dorman) is limited by
   variation in fire and hydrological regimes, occurring only in relatively
   dry areas and succeeding to hardwood hammocks when fire is absent. These
   same forces also appear important in driving smaller-scale variation in
   the structure and composition of slash-pine forests. Important gaps
   remain, however, in our understanding of how plants and animals in
   slash-pine ecosystems respond to variation in fire and hydrological
   regimes. We addressed this issue for one taxon - landbirds - by
   estimating density at 285 locations in southwest Florida that differed
   in fire history and water-table elevation. Bird densities during the
   breeding season and during the winter did not vary appreciably as a
   function of either fire history or water-table elevation, and neither
   did vegetation structure at our survey locations. Birds and plants in
   this fire-climax forest are both resilient and resistant to changes
   brought about by frequent, low-intensity fire, and we suspect that
   significant effects of variation in fire history are only observable
   under extreme conditions (e.g., complete fire suppression) outside of
   the range of variation that we sampled. Water-table elevation had a
   stronger, albeit still small, effect on bird densities and vegetation
   structure, but the effects were difficult to generalize. Sampling across
   a broader range of hydrological conditions may yield valuable insight
   into the structure of pineland bird assemblages, especially given the
   likelihood that ecosystem restoration efforts in south Florida will
   produce substantial changes in water-table elevation.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the distribution, habitat and population
   dynamics of the swamp antechinus (Antechinus minimus maritimus) in the
   eastern Otway Ranges. The species has a restricted, disjunct
   distribution and has been recorded at 25 sites between 1969 and 1999.
   All sites were located within 7 km of the coast, occurred at altitudes
   up to 80 m above sea level and within 10 m of a gully. Analysis of
   landscape site variables identified sun index as being significant in
   determination of the probability of occurrence of A. minimus. The
   presence of A. minimus is negatively associated with sun index, occuring
   at sites that have a southerly aspect and gentle slope. A. minimus was
   located in a range of structural vegetation including Open Forest, Low
   Woodland, Shrubland and Hummock Grassland and a number of floristic
   groups, some characterised by high frequencies of sclerophyll shrubs,
   others by high frequencies of Pteridium esculentum, hummock grasses and
   herbaceous species. A. minimus occurs in fragmented, small populations
   with maximum population densities of 1.1-18 ha(-1). Populations at
   inland sites became extinct after the 1983 wildfire which burnt 41 000
   ha. These sites have not been recolonised since, while on the coast the
   species did not re-establish until 1993-97. One population that is
   restricted to a narrow coastal strip of habitat is characterised by high
   levels of transient animals. The species is subject to extinction in the
   region due to habitat fragmentation, coastal developments and fire.
   Management actions to secure the present populations and ensure
   long-term survival of the species in the area are required and include
   implementation of appropriate fire regimes, prevention of habitat
   fragmentation, revegetation of habitat, and establishment of corridor
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Natural resource managers need better estimates of water storage and
   supply in forested landscapes. These estimates would aid planning for
   management activities that maintain and enhance forest health and
   productivity and help prepare forested landscapes for a changing
   climate. In particular, low soil moisture in combination with high
   evaporative demands can induce significant stresses on forests,
   increasing vulnerability to attacks of insect and disease, as well as
   increasing wildfire risk. Although high-resolution soils data exist for
   much of the Pacific Northwest, regional-scale datasets that identify
   forested areas potentially vulnerable to soil moisture-related drought
   do not exist. In this study, we used readily available spatial datasets
   depicting available water supply, soil depth, and evapotranspiration to
   model the likelihood that soils experience prolonged summer drying. To
   calibrate the model, we examined soil profile descriptions, lab data,
   and soil moisture curves for 25 sites throughout the Pacific Northwest
   and estimated the average annual number of days that soil moisture drops
   to levels at or below the permanent wilting point, a theoretical lower
   limit of plant-available water. Using this approach, we found
   statistically significant relationships between the independent
   variables and broad classes of soil moisture levels representing the
   highest and lowest levels of plant-available moisture. We then used
   these relationships to create a landscape-level droughty soil index for
   the Pacific Northwest. We expect that this approach can be further
   developed to include additional soil moisture data outside Washington
   and Oregon and enhanced with other explanatory variables such as
   topographic position, elevation, and vegetation type. With the addition
   of vegetation-related data, in particular, the current modeling approach
   can aid in identifying vulnerable landscapes in the context of managing
   for increased forest resiliency in the Pacific Northwest.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction and demography of the northern quoll, Dasyurus hallucatus,
   was assessed using live-trapping and radio-tracking at a lowland savanna
   site in Kakadu National Park between 1992 and 1995. Northern quolls were
   found to exhibit a highly synchronous breeding cycle with mating
   occurring late May/early June. The greatest peak in apparent male
   abundance was during the mating season, but this was probably due to
   their increased mobility at this time. Males demonstrated complete
   post-mating mortality, with most males dying within two weeks of mating.
   Young were born in mid to late June with the mean initial litter size
   for 8-teated females being 7.3. First-year mothers were more likely to
   have predominantly male litters, whereas second-year mothers had more
   females. The survival rate of pouch young was high but, once young were
   left in the den, survival was poor. Peaks in abundance for both sexes
   occurred when the juveniles first entered the trappable population in
   November each year. Mortality of females was high, with only 27\% of
   females surviving to wean a second litter, and none bore a third. The
   most common proximate cause of adult mortality was predation. Increased
   predation pressure on adults, in particular due to a reduction in
   shelter and ground cover from too-frequent fire may make northern quolls
   vulnerable to local extinction in lowland savanna.}},

   birch and rowan but aspen survival was only enhanced by burning on
   clearcuts and areas with 50 m(3)/ha of retention trees. Excluding moose
   enhanced rowan growth and birch survival. Aspen growth and survival was
   enhanced when both moose and hare were excluded. Seedlings were most
   frequently browsed on clearcuts and most seedling mortality was caused

   may be smaller than that of other herbivores or the fire-management

Abstract = {{Natural accumulations of skeletal material (death assemblages) have the
   potential to provide historical data on species diversity and population
   structure for regions lacking decades of wildlife monitoring, thereby
   contributing valuable baseline data for conservation and management
   strategies. Previous studies of the ecological and temporal resolutions
   of death assemblages from terrestrial large-mammal communities, however,
   have largely focused on broad patterns of community composition in
   tropical settings. Here, I expand the environmental sampling of
   large-mammal death assemblages into a temperate biome and explore more
   demanding assessments of ecological fidelity by testing their capacity
   to record past population fluctuations of individual species in the
   well-studied ungulate community of Yellowstone National Park
   (Yellowstone). Despite dramatic ecological changes following the 1988
   wildfires and 1995 wolf re-introduction, the Yellowstone death
   assemblage is highly faithful to the living community in species
   richness and community structure. These results agree with studies of
   tropical death assemblages and establish the broad capability of
   vertebrate remains to provide high-quality ecological data from
   disparate ecosystems and biomes. Importantly, the Yellowstone death
   assemblage also correctly identifies species that changed significantly
   in abundance over the last 20 to,80 years and the directions of those
   shifts (including local invasions and extinctions). The relative
   frequency of fresh versus weathered bones for individual species is also
   consistent with documented trends in living population sizes.
   Radiocarbon dating verifies the historical source of bones from Equus
   caballus (horse): a functionally extinct species. Bone surveys are a
   broadly valuable tool for obtaining population trends and baseline
   shifts over decadal-to-centennial timescales.}},

Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Tropical dry forests are the most threatened tropical terrestrial
   ecosystem. However, few studies have been conducted on the natural
   regeneration necessary to restore these forests. We reviewed the ecology
   of regeneration of tropical dry forests as a tool to restore disturbed
   lands. Dry forests are characterized by a relatively high number of tree
   species with small, dry, wind-dispersed seeds. Over small scales,
   wind-dispersed seeds are better able to colonize degraded areas than
   vertebrate-dispersed plants. Small seeds and those with low water
   content are less susceptible to desiccation, which is a major barrier
   for establishment in open areas. Seeds are available in the soil in the
   early rainy season to maximize the time to grow. However, highly
   variable precipitation and frequent dry spells are important sources of
   mortality in seeds and seedlings. Collecting seeds at the end of the dry
   season and planting them when soil has sufficient moisture may increase
   seedling establishment and reduce the time they are exposed to seed
   predators. Germination and early establishment in the field are favored
   in shaded sites, which have milder environment and moister soil than
   open sites during low rainfall periods. Growth of established seedlings,
   however, is favored in open areas. Therefore, clipping plants around
   established seedlings may be a good management option to improve growth
   and survival. Although dry forests have species either resistant to fire
   or that benefit from it, frequent fires simplify community species
   composition. Resprouting ability is a noticeable mechanism of
   regeneration in dry forests and must be considered for restoration. The
   approach to dry-forest restoration should be tailored to this ecosystem
   instead of merely following approaches developed for moister forests.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are among the most imperiled ecosystems in North America.
   Reasons that grasslands are threatened include conversion to row-crop
   agriculture, fragmentation, and changes in fire regimes. The reduction
   of fire processes in remaining prairies has resulted in tree
   encroachment and establishment in grasslands, further reducing grassland
   quantity and quality. Grassland birds have been experiencing precipitous
   population declines in recent decades, commensurate with landscape
   changes to grasslands. The lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus
   pallidicinctus Ridgway) is a declining species of prairie grouse of
   conservation concern. We used second-and third-order habitat selection
   metrics to test if female lesser prairie-chickens avoid grasslands where
   trees were present. Our results indicated that female lesser
   prairie-chickens selected habitats avoiding the nearest trees by 283 m
   on average, nearly twice as far as would be expected at random. Lesser
   prairie-chickens were 40 times more likely to use habitats with tree
   densities of 0 trees.ha(-1) than habitats with 5 trees.ha(-1).
   Probability of use indicated that lesser prairie-chickens were 19 times
   more likely to use habitats 1000 m from the nearest tree when compared
   with using habitats 0 m from the nearest tree. Nest survival was not
   affected at densities <2 trees.ha(-1); however, we could not test if
   nest survival was affected at greater tree densities as no nests were
   detected at densities >2 trees.ha(-1). Avoidance of trees could be due
   to perceived increased predation risk, reduced habitat quality, or a
   combination of these potentially confounding factors. Preventing further
   establishment and expansion of trees in landscapes occupied by lesser
   prairie-chickens could contribute to the continued persistence of the
   species. Additionally, restoring grasslands through tree removal may
   facilitate conservation efforts for grassland species such as the lesser
   prairie-chicken by improving habitat quality and promoting expansion of
   occupied range. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{994-1004}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We reviewed the behavior of wildfire in riparian zones, primarily in the
   western United States, and the potential ecological consequences of
   postfire logging. Fire behavior in riparian zones is complex, but many
   aquatic and riparian organisms exhibit a suite of adaptations that allow
   relatively rapid recovery after fire. Unless constrained by other
   factors, fish tend to rebound relatively quickly, usually within a
   decade after a wildfire. Additionally, fire and subsequent erosion
   events contribute wood and coarse sediment that can create and maintain
   productive aquatic habitats over time. The potential effects of postfire
   logging in riparian areas depend on the landscape context and
   disturbance history of a site; however, available evidence suggests two
   key management implications: (I) fire in riparian areas creates
   conditions that may not require intervention to sustain the long-term
   productivity of the aquatic network and (2) protection of burned
   riparian areas gives priority to what is left rather than what is
   removed. Research is needed to determine how postfire logging in
   riparian areas has affected the spread of invasive species and the
   vulnerability of upland forests to insect and disease outbreaks and how
   postfire logging will affect the frequency and behavior of future fires.
   The effectiveness of using postfire logging to restore desired riparian
   structure and function is therefore unproven, but such projects are
   gaining interest with the departure of forest conditions from those that
   existed prior to timber harvest fire suppression, and climate change. In
   the absence of reliable information about the potential consequence of
   postfire timber harvest, we conclude that providing postfire riparian
   zones with the same environmental protections they received before they
   burned is justified ecologically. Without a commitment to monitor
   management experiments, the effects of postfire riparian logging will
   remain unknown and highly contentious.}},

   by transient individuals from neighboring populations. The patterns of
   microhabitat use of C. tener changed in response to fire. Before fire,
   the marginal area of the grid was preferred by C. tener; after fire, the
   inner area was more important compared to pre-fire levels. The mean body

Abstract = {{In northern areas of their expanded range, information on Merriam's

   pertaining to wintering behavior and factors associated with winter
   habitat selection. Forest managers need detailed quantification of the
   effects of logging and other management practices on wintering habitats

   habitat selection patterns within ponderosa pine (Punts ponderosa)
   forests and determined factors associated with use of farmsteads by
   Merriarn s turkeys in the southern Black Hills, South Dakota. We
   radio-marked 86 female Merriam's turkeys (70 adults and 16 yearlings)
   and monitored them during winter (1 December-31 March), 2001-2004.
   Female Wild Turkeys used recently burned pine forest less than expected
   but selected farmsteads and stands of mature ponderosa pine (< 70\%
   overstory canopy cover, > 22.9 cm diameter at breast height {[}DBH]
   trees) for foraging sites. Within forests, female Wild Turkeys selected
   foraging sites with less understory vegetation and visual obstruction,
   and larger-diameter ponderosa pine. Ponderosa pine seed abundance varied
   among years, and pine seeds were most abundant in stands of 30-35 cm DBH
   with basal area of 22-28 m(2) center dot ha(-1). Abundance of pine seeds
   may have influenced use of farmsteads by Wild Turkeys, more so than
   ambient temperatures or snow depth. In the southern Black Hills,
   management should emphasize open- to mid-canopy and
   mature-structural-stage pine stands, where seed production was greatest.
   During winters when mast from pine is unavailable, farmsteads likely
   provide nutritional supplementation and may be important for maintaining
   Merriam's turkey populations.}},

Abstract = {{The Sumatran tiger, categorized as Critically Endangered on the 2002
   IUCN Red List, is threatened by poaching for domestic and international
   markets, by prey depletion from human hunting and by habitat loss from
   illegal and commercial logging, oil palm production, pioneer farming,

   photo-trapping and tiger distribution in KSNP and adjoining forest.
   Tigers were found to be present in all habitat types across KSNP. The
   poaching pressures on tigers and their prey species were evaluated from
   confiscations of snare traps by Tiger Protection and Conservation Units
   (TPCU). Poaching pressures were found to be highest for muntjac, then
   sambar, tiger, and serow and mouse deer. We determined the effectiveness
   of TPCU patrol size from the number of arrests, and chainsaw and snare
   trap confiscations per patrol. The success of forest patrols increased
   with the number of TPCU staff per patrol. We looked at general law
   enforcement for KSNP, which appeared to be inadequate. To reduce the
   threat posed by poaching and illegal logging extra TPCU staff are
   required for patrols, and extra patrol units are required for the
   northern and southern sections of the Park. In KSNP it is necessary to
   monitor habitat loss, establish an unambiguous scheme to mitigate

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{149-155}},
Abstract = {{The northern hairy-nosed wombat, Lasiorhinus krefftii, is listed as
   critically endangered in Australia and is restricted to a single
   population of similar to 90 animals in central Queensland. The area
   receives low rainfall and is regularly subjected to periods of drought
   and therefore is at risk from wildfire. There is a clear link between
   good wet seasons and higher levels of reproductive activity. A long-term
   management goal of the L. krefftii recovery program has been to
   determine preferred feed of wombats and to gain acceptance of
   supplementary feed and water by L. krefftii in order to mitigate the
   effects of drought and wildfire and potentially increase fecundity and
   survivorship rates in the population. Prior to this study, there had
   been several unsuccessful attempts to induce L. krefftii to take
   supplementary feed and water, but the current study, which was of a
   longer duration, has shown that L. krefftii will readily take
   supplementary feed and water. In addition, L. krefftii prefers certain
   feed types ( Complete-O ( primarily steam-flaked barley with molasses
   and lucerne and oaten chaff), and Town and Country pellet mix (
   primarily wheat, barley and sorghum, with canola and soybean meal)) and
   will visit sources of feed and water on a nightly basis. Visits by L.
   krefftii to supplementary feed and water sites were related to the
   occurrence of rainfall, with visits declining after rain.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the recent spread of white nose syndrome, it is imperative that
   managers understand the effects their management techniques have on bat
   species. Our research alms to determine the spatial and temporal
   variation in occupancy of bat species native to the Ozark Highlands and
   Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas. Although prescribed burn units
   in this region are burned on a three-year rotation, it is not currently
   known how this treatment schedule affects bats. To determine the effects
   of prescribed burns on bat species including Myotis grisescens,
   Nycticeius humeralis, and Perimyotis subflavus, acoustic monitors and
   insect traps were deployed at 20 burned and 20 unburned sites that were
   visited twice, between April and November of 2017. Bat calls were
   analyzed for presence/absence data. Single season occupancy modeling was
   used to determine the effects of environmental covariates on
   probabilities of detection and occupancy. In total, 132,528 acoustic
   files were collected. The probability of detection for each bat species
   was affected by temperature or moon phase. Occupancy models indicated
   that probability of occupancy for all species was affected by seasonal
   changes and basal area (m(2)/Ha), and all but one were affected by prey
   biomass. These data indicate that although prescribed burns may have not
   directly affected bats, potential indirect effects of fire, basal area
   and insect biomass, appear to have significant impacts.}},

Abstract = {{In 1993, a group of national forest stakeholders, the Quincy Library
   Group, crafted a proposal that intended to reduce wildfire risk, protect
   the California spotted owl ( Strix occidentalis occidentalis), restore
   watersheds, and enhance community stability by ensuring a predictable
   supply of timber for area sawmills and biomass for energy plants. The
   Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act of 1998
   codified this proposal, directing the USDA Forest Service to conduct
   forest treatments on 40,000-60,000 acres per year by creating defensible
   fuel profile zones and logging by group-and individual tree-selection
   methods. The law also designated an Independent Science Panel to review
   monitoring studies, administrative studies, and research to assess
   efficacy of the implementation and achievement of goals. Although
   several goals were achieved, implementation fell short of treatment and
   volume goals, and evidence was lacking to make conclusive judgments
   about environmental impacts. Shortcomings were due to differing
   interpretations of the Act's prescriptive intent, changes in management
   direction, compounding economic factors, appeals and litigation,
   variation in site-specific forest conditions, and variation in
   approaches among national forests and districts. Most notable was a lack
   of monitoring of the treatment effects on California spotted owl
   populations and other environmental concerns. These findings suggest
   that attempts to legislate prescriptive, collaboratively developed
   proposals may not account for the complex biophysical, management,
   social, and economic contexts within which national forest management
   occurs. These findings also suggest that current national forest
   policies and directives promoting collaboration should also be

Abstract = {{Effective restoration of threatened or endangered species requires

   93\% of this habitat has been lost to urban and agricultural
   development. We released over 325 captive-born rabbits at the San
   Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) between July 2002 and
   July 2005, and we monitored 312 of these rabbits via radiotelemetry to
   assess spatial and habitat selection. Home ranges and core areas were
   similar among males and females, and were larger in the breeding season
   than during the nonbreeding season. Perhaps reflecting a growing
   population, home range estimates decreased in size over the duration of
   the study Animals moved in response to a wildfire in July 2004, but home
   range area was similar in 90-day pre- and postfire periods. Of 1,143
   possible dyads, 534 (47\%) exhibited a mean of 86\% overlap in 95\%
   fixed-kernel home ranges. Overlap did not differ by dyad type (e.g.,
   male male), but was greater in nonbreeding than in breeding seasons;
   unlike home ranges, we did not detect any temporal changes in overlap as
   might be expected in a growing population. Riparian brush rabbits
   exhibit scale-independent habitat selection, disproportionately favoring
   thick understory cover such as sandbar willow mixed with dense shrubs
   (blackberry, roses). Refuge managers have promoted escape cover and

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Restoration efforts in Florida's Everglades focus on preserving and
   restoring this unique wetland's natural landscape. Because most of the
   Everglades is a freshwater peatland, it requires surplus rainfall to
   remain a peatland. Restoration plans generally assume a stable climate,
   yet projections of altered climate over a 50-year time horizon suggest
   that this assumption may be inappropriate. Using a legacy regional
   hydrological model, we simulated combinations of a temperature rise of
   1.5 A degrees C, a +/- A 10 \% change in rainfall, and a 0.46 m sea
   level rise relative to base conditions. The scenario of increased
   evapotranspiration and increased rainfall produced a slight increase in
   available water. In contrast, the more likely scenario of increased
   evapotranspiration and decreased rainfall lowered median water depths by
   5-114 cm and shortened inundation duration periods by 5-45 \%. Sea level
   rise increased stages and inundation duration in southern Everglades
   National Park. These ecologically significant decreases in water depths
   and inundation duration periods would greatly alter current ecosystems
   through severe droughts, peat loss and carbon emissions, wildfires, loss
   of the unique ridge and slough patterns, large shifts in plant and
   animal communities, and increased exotic species invasions. These
   results suggest using adaptive restoration planning, a method that
   explicitly incorporates large climatic and environmental uncertainties
   into long-term ecosystem restoration plans, structural design, and
   management. Anticipated water constraints necessitate alternative
   approaches to restoration, including maintaining critical landscapes and
   facilitating transitions in others. Accommodating these uncertainties
   may improve the likelihood of restoration success.}},

   The Interagency Mapping and Analysis Project (IMAP) is an ongoing effort
   to generate landscape-wide vegetation data and models to evaluate the
   integrated effects of disturbances and management activities on natural
   resource conditions in Oregon and Washington (USA). In this initial
   analysis, we characterized the spatial distribution of forest and range
   land development in a four-county pilot study region in central Oregon.
   The empirical model describes the spatial distribution of buildings and
   new building construction as a function of population growth, existing
   development, topography, land-use zoning, and other factors. We used the
   model to create geographic information system maps of likely future
   development based on human population projections to inform
   complementary landscape analyses underway involving vegetation, habitat,
   and wildfire interactions. In an example application, we use the model
   and resulting maps to show the potential impacts of future forest and
   range land development on mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) winter range.
   Results indicate significant development encroachment and habitat loss
   already in 2000 with development located along key migration routes and
   increasing through the projection period to 2040. The example

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{405}},
Pages = {{166-178}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Restoration of western dry forests in the USA often focuses on reducing
   fuel loads. In the range of the spotted owl, these treatments may reduce
   canopy cover and tree density, which could reduce preferred habitat
   conditions for the owl and other sensitive species. In particular, high
   canopy cover (>= 70\%) has been widely reported to be an important
   feature of spotted owl habitat, but averages of stand-level forest cover
   do not provide important information on foliage height and gap
   structure. To provide better quantification of canopy structure, we used
   airborne LiDAR imagery to identify canopy cover in different height
   strata and the size and frequency of gaps that were associated with owl
   nest sites, protected activity centers (PACs), and territories within
   four study areas and 316 owl territories. Although total canopy cover
   was high in nest stands and PAC areas, the cover in tall ( > 48 m) trees
   was the canopy structure most highly selected for, while cover in lower
   strata (2-16 m) was avoided compared to availability in the surrounding
   landscape. Tall tree cover gradually decreased and lower strata cover
   increased as distance increased from the nest. Large ( > 1000 m(2)) gaps
   were not found near nests, but otherwise there was no difference in gap
   frequencies and sizes between PACs and territories and the surrounding
   landscape. Using cluster analysis we classified canopy conditions into 5
   structural classes and 4 levels of canopy cover to assess the
   relationship between total canopy cover and tree size within nest sites,
   PACs, and territories. High canopy cover (>= 70\%) mostly occurs when
   large tree cover is high, indicating the two variables are often
   confounded. Our results suggest that the cover of tall trees may be a
   better predictor of owl habitat than total canopy cover because the
   latter can include cover in the 2-16 m strata - conditions that owls
   actually avoid. Management strategies designed to preserve and
   facilitate the growth of tall trees while reducing the cover and density
   of understory trees may improve forest resilience to drought and
   wildfire while also maintaining or promoting the characteristics of owl
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Until recently the severe decline in the populations of many species of
   grassland birds in eastern North America has aroused relatively little
   concern or conservation action. This response appears to be rooted in
   the perception that grassland birds invaded the East Coast from western
   grasslands after European settlers cleared the forest. Detailed
   historical accounts and analysis of pollen deposits, however, show that
   open grasslands existed on the East Coast of North America at the time
   of European settlement. Extensive grasslands resulted from burning and
   agricultural clearing by Native Americans. Natural disturbances, such as
   wildfire and beaver (Castor canadensis) activity, produced grasslands
   even before Native Americans cleared the forest. The presence of
   specialized grassland birds in Pleistocene deposits and in the earliest
   ornithological collections from eastern North America, and the existence
   of distinctive eastern populations of the Greater Prairie-Chicken
   (Tympanuchus cupido). Henslow's Sparrow (Ammodramus henslowii), and
   Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), indicate that grassland
   birds are an ancient component of biological diversity on the heavily

Abstract = {{The potential of invasive plants to alter fuel properties over time has
   implications for the ranchers of semiarid rangelands throughout the
   world. A prime example of this phenomenon is the cheatgrass (Bromus
   tectorum L.) invasion of the native shrub-steppe lands in Great Basin of
   the western United States. The purpose of this study is to develop a
   bioeconomic model that optimizes simulated ranch behavior given the
   beginning stages of cheatgrass invasion on a public forage allotment.
   The bioeconomic model is applied to a typical eastern Oregon 300
   cow-calf ranch. Livestock production decisions are simulated over a
   40-yr planning horizon using a multiperiod linear programming model.
   Results showed changes in profit-maximizing ranch management strategies
   in the form of decreased optimal stocking rates and forage substitution.
   The net present value of the simulated ranch's income stream declined,
   and the probability that the ranch cannot meet its full costs of
   livestock production and would exit the industry increased as a result.
   These economic impacts were more pronounced with decreased sale price.
   Sensitivity analysis showed that overall results in terms of ranch
   behavior were specific neither to the assumed discount rate nor to the
   assumed percentage of cheatgrass cover (as long as this percentage is
   within the reference state) on the public grazing allotment. This study
   introduces a method for managers to quantify impacts on ranches from
   fuel-altering invasive plants on public lands, emphasizing the
   importance of including information about native and invasive forage
   production characteristics and wildfire frequency as a function of the
   state of invasion.}},

   and herbicide (Glyphosate) were used to reduce fuel load and invasive

   the widest range of restoration goals: it reduced fire fuel load,
   increased ant occurrence (the primary prey of A. parapulchella) in the
   short-term and increased the growth and survival of native grasses.
   Lizards colonised the restored habitat within a year of treatment. Our
   study documents an innovative way by which conflicts between

Abstract = {{Although carnivorous plants are widely recognized as being generally
   restricted to open habitats, tests of the effects of competition on
   individual performance are extremely rare. In this study, I examined the
   effects of the removal of herbaceous and shrub canopies on seedling
   density and growth, survival, and reproduction of phytometers of a small
   insectivorous plant, Drosera capillaris (pink sundew). I also examined
   the distribution of this species in relation to the occurrence of woody
   species in a frequently burned wet savanna in southeastern Mississippi.
   Killing plants and removing dead biomass increased seedling density in
   both open areas and shrub thickets. The removal of dead biomass
   following herbicide application was critical to increasing densities of
   seedlings. Killing plants with herbicide without also clearing residual
   litter and standing dead was not sufficient to increase seedling
   densities in shrub thickets. Although the removal of the groundcover
   canopy strongly influenced the density of seedlings, it had very little
   effect on survival, growth, and reproduction of small phytometers during
   a single growing season. Survival of phytometers was greater in open
   areas than in shrub thickets, regardless of whether the groundcover
   canopy was removed. Densities of both seedlings and adults were greater
   in open areas away from shrub thickets than beneath the woody canopies
   of thickets and were negatively correlated with the leaf area index of
   groundcover vegetation. Results of this study show that the
   establishment of this carnivorous plant species is limited in part by
   the effects of litter on seedling density in both open areas and shrub
   thickets.}},

Abstract = {{A century of fire suppression has created unnaturally dense stands in
   many western North American forests, and silviculture treatments are
   being increasingly used to reduce fuels to mitigate wildfire hazards and
   manage insect infestations. Thinning prescriptions have the potential to
   restore forests to a more historically sustainable state, but land
   managers need to be aware of the potential impacts of such treatments on
   invasion by exotic plants. However, the effects of these activities on
   the introduction and spread of invasive plants are not well understood.
   We evaluated noxious weed occurrence over a 9-year period (20012009)
   following thinning and burning treatments in a lodgepole pine forest in
   central Montana. Surveys were made in the treatment units and along
   roads for two shelterwood-with-reserve prescriptions, each with and
   without prescribed burning, burned only, and untreated controls. Five
   species listed as noxious weeds in Montana were recorded: spotted
   knapweed (Centaurea stoebe), oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), Canada
   thistle (Cirsium arvense), common tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), and
   houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale). With the exception of Canada
   thistle, noxious weeds were confined to roadsides and did not colonize
   silvicultural treatment areas. Roadside habitats contributed more to the
   distribution of noxious plant species than did silvicultural treatments
   in this relatively uninvaded forest, indicating the importance of weed
   control tactics along roads and underscoring the need to mitigate exotic
   plant dispersal by motorized vehicles. In addition, these findings
   suggest that roadways should be considered when evaluating the potential
   for invasion and spread of exotic plants following forest restoration
   treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Aim African elephants are ecosystem engineers. As such, their long-term
   patterns of distribution and abundance (i.e., space-use intensity) will
   influence ecosystem structure and function. We elucidate these patterns
   for bull versus herd groups, by analysing the spatiotemporal dynamics of
   an increasing elephant population in relation to key ecological drivers:
   rainfall, distance to major rivers and time since last fire. Significant
   changes to the long-term patterns of elephant density and group-type
   probabilities are identified and explained. Location Kruger National
   Park, South Africa. Methods Using almost three decades of census records
   (1985-2012), we applied Multiple Point Process Models to assess the
   influence of rainfall, rivers and fire in shaping elephant space-use.
   Significant changes to the long-term patterns of elephant density and
   group type were also identified using kernel density estimates and the
   spatially varying probability of encountering either bull or herd group.
   Results Bull and herd groups are no longer clearly segregated as
   available empty space becomes more limited. Bull and herd groups have
   dichotomous resource selection functions, in that bulls concentrate in
   areas receiving lower rainfall but more frequent fires while herds
   concentrate in higher rainfall areas experiencing less frequent fires.
   Both bull and herd groups concentrate closer to major rivers,
   emphasizing rivers as important spatial drivers. Overall, densities
   increased most significantly closer to rivers and in areas experiencing
   fewer fires. Fire was also a strong agent of group-type change, as the
   probability of finding bulls, contrary to herds, significantly increased
   as fire return periods shortened. Main conclusions Elephant distribution
   and abundance patterns have homogenized in response to increased space
   limitations, with group-specific, fire-driven distribution patterns
   emerging overtime. Results herein should be used to help manage elephant
   space-use through the establishment of possible refuge areas and the
   development of more empirical research into elephant impacts in future.}},

Abstract = {{Population declines of birds that breed in early-successional shrubland

   we studied birds in temporary forest openings created through even-aged
   timber harvest, and permanent wildlife openings maintained through
   mechanical treatment and prescribed burning in the Northern
   Appalachians, USA in 2010 and 2011. We assessed the effects of treatment
   method, time since last treatment, and retained tree cover on shrubland
   bird abundance and habitat conditions. Burned and mechanically treated
   wildlife openings differed only in grass and fern cover. Both types of
   wildlife openings had more grasses and forbs, and less bare ground than
   silvicultural openings. Six out of 8 focal bird species were less
   abundant in silvicultural openings than in wildlife openings. In
   contrast, abundance of only 1 species differed between burned and
   mechanically treated wildlife openings. Silvicultural openings supported
   the same species as wildlife openings, indicating that this management
   option could be used in place of more costly wildlife opening
   management. However, because birds were more abundant in wildlife
   openings, maintaining the current population size of shrubland birds
   under a management strategy based entirely on silviculture would require
   a 50-300\% increase in the area of silvicultural openings, depending on
   the species. Individual species peaked in abundance at different times
   post treatment, indicating that managers must maintain a range of
   early-successional conditions across the landscape to provide habitat
   for the entire suite of shrubland birds. Six species exhibited a

   large, wingless seeds serve as a high energy food source for many

   white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle, drought, and fire
   suppression. Outplanting of seedlings is a common strategy to aid in
   restoration efforts, but the success of revegetation methods in limber
   pine habitats is little known. To aid in restoration efforts in Waterton
   Lakes National Park, in southwestern Alberta, and other impacted areas,
   we studied the survival of limber pine planted as seeds and those
   planted as seedlings. At our experimental site, 11 percent of the seeds
   had germinated and seedlings were still alive after three years, while
   72 percent of the seedlings that were planted directly survived.
   Restoration efforts are likely to have greater success when limber pine

Abstract = {{Targeted livestock grazing is a proven tool for manipulating rangeland
   vegetation, and current knowledge about targeted livestock grazing is
   extensive and expanding rapidly. Targeted grazing prescriptions optimize
   the timing, frequency, intensity, and selectivity of grazing (or
   browsing) in combinations that purposely exert grazing/browsing pressure
   on specific plant species or portions of the landscape. Targeted grazing
   differs from traditional grazing management in that the goal of targeted
   grazing is to apply defoliation or trampling to achieve specific
   vegetation management objectives, whereas the goal of traditional
   livestock grazing management is generally the production of livestock
   commodities. A shared aim of targeted livestock grazing and traditional
   grazing management is to sustain healthy soils, flora, fauna, and water
   resources that, in turn, can sustain natural ecological processes (e.g.,
   nutrient cycle, water cycle, energy flow). Targeted grazing
   prescriptions integrate knowledge of plant ecology, livestock nutrition,
   and livestock foraging behavior. Livestock can be focused on target
   areas through fencing, herding, or supplement placement. Although
   practices can be developed to minimize the impact of toxins contained in
   target plants, the welfare of the animals used in targeted grazing must
   be a priority. Monitoring is needed to determine if targeted grazing is
   successful and to refine techniques to improve efficacy and efficiency.
   Examples of previous research studies and approaches are presented to
   highlight the ecological benefits that can be achieved when targeted
   grazing is applied properly. These cases include ways to suppress
   invasive plants and ways to enhance wildlife habitat and biodiversity.
   Future research should address the potential to select more adapted and
   effective livestock for targeted grazing and the associated animal
   welfare concerns with this practice. Targeted livestock grazing provides
   land managers a viable alternative to mechanical, chemical, and
   prescribed fire treatments to manipulate rangeland vegetation. (C) 2019

   Squirrels had a relatively high probability of detection (0.680) but a
   low probability of occupancy (0.111). Eastern Fox Squirrel occupancy was
   negatively associated with slope steepness. This result is possibly
   because prescribed fire and other restoration efforts of open-pine
   conditions associated with Eastern Fox Squirrel habitat in Talladega
   National Forest are focused on logistically accessible ridges and more
   moderately sloped areas. Steep slopes also likely decrease accessibility
   and dispersion ability for Eastern Fox Squirrels. The overall low

Volume = {{241}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The global climate is changing faster than previously anticipated.
   Although scientists expect cumulatively deleterious impacts to birds and
   other wildlife, effects on individual species are likely more complex.
   The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has monitored > 100
   songbirds across 37,600 km(2) of Northern California conifer forests for
   close to two decades to facilitate informed, science-based conservation
   planning. The study area represents 42\% of all conifer forests in the
   state. Autonomous sound recorders were used to survey birds at 1065
   randomly distributed sites from 2002 to 2016. The richness of
   Neotropical migrants declined below 1515 m (90\% CI: 1150-1950 m)
   elevation whereas it increased above this threshold after controlling
   for changes in tree cover due to forestry and wildfire. This finding
   suggests an overall upward shift in Neotropical migrant distributions in
   response to an annual 0.037 degrees C (90\% CI: 0.029-0.045 degrees C)
   increase in mean daily May temperature during the timespan. Residents
   and altitudinal migrants may be less vulnerable to increasing
   temperatures, conversely, as evidence of elevational shifting was much
   weaker or non-existent for them. Yet for individual species, there were
   both declines and increases in occupancy. Rapid and mixed population
   trends, in combination with elevational range shifts, suggest that
   songbirds vary widely in their capacity to adapt to climate change and
   other stressors. Conservation of structurally-complex and fire resilient
   forests above similar to 1500 m elevation is paramount in helping to
   buffer songbirds against rising temperatures. The expansion of
   biodiversity monitoring across large taxonomic, spatial, and temporal
   extents is vital to effective conservation planning.}},

Abstract = {{Issues related to forest health and the threat of larger, more
   destructive wildfires have led to major new initiatives to restructure
   and recompose forest communities in the western United States. Proposed
   solutions will depend, in part, on silvicultural treatments and
   prescribed burning. Large fires can produce dramatic changes in aquatic
   systems, including altered sediment and flow regimes, fish mortality,
   and even local extinctions. Responses of salmonid populations to large
   disturbances such as fire indicate that complexity and spatial diversity
   of habitats are important to the resilience and persistence of
   populations. Some populations retain the ecological diversity necessary
   to persist in the face of large fires, and natural events such as
   wildfire have been important in creating and maintaining habitat
   diversity. Although timber harvest and fire can precipitate similar
   changes in watershed processes, we do not necessarily expect the
   physical and ecological consequences of large fires and timber harvest
   to be the same. We agree that healthy forests are fundamental to healthy
   aquatic ecosystems. In their haste to restore unhealthy forests,
   however, managers must take care to avoid simplistic solutions that
   compound problems already present in the management of aquatic
   ecosystems and native fishes. Management to restore ecological
   structure, composition, and process is largely experimental and

Title = {{Aquaporin-4 in the formation of cerebral edema following severe burns
   What role do arginine vasopressin levels play?}},
Journal = {{NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), which is able to rapidly transport
   water within the brain, is highly expressed in brain tissue. It also
   plays an important role in the formation of cerebral edema following
   brain injury. However, the role of AQP-4 in the formation of cerebral
   edema following severe burns remains unknown.
   OBJECTIVE: To study changes in AQP-4 protein and mRNA expression during
   formation of cerebral edema following severe burns, and to explore the
   correlation between AQP-4 protein and mRNA expression with plasma levels
   of arginine vasopressin (AVP).
   DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized, controlled, animal experiment
   was performed at the Research Center of Neuroscience, Chongqing Medical
   University from 2007 to 2008.
   MATERIALS: Biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody was provided by
   Beijing Zhongshan Biotechnology, China; in situ hybridization kit was
   provided by Wuhan Boster Biotechnology, China; rabbit anti-AQP-4
   polyclonal antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit
   IgG were provided by Chemicon, USA; AVP radioimmunoassay kit was
   provided by the Research Department of Neurobiology, the Second Military
   Medical University of Shanghai, China.
   METHODS: A total of 180 adult, healthy, Wistar rats were randomly
   assigned to control and burn groups with 30 rats in each group. The burn
   group was observed at five different time points: 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48
   hours after burn. Hair on the mouse back was removed to expose skin on
   the back. After 1 day, skin with the hair removed was dipped into 100
   degrees C water for 15 seconds to induce grade III burn injury that
   measures 30\% of total burn surface area.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain water content was measured using the
   dry-wet weight method. AQP-4 protein and mRNA expressions were detected
   using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; dynamic changes in
   plasma AVP were detected using radioimmunoassay.
   RESULTS: Brain water content gradually increased following severe burn
   injury. AQP-4 protein and mRNA expressions were upregulated in the
   supraoptic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus,
   hippocampus, choroid plexus, and cerebral cortex. Plasma AVP levels
   increased following burn injury. AQP-4 protein and mRNA expressions
   positively correlated with brain water content and AVP levels during
   formation of cerebral edema (r = 0.870, 0.848, P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: AQP-4 participated in the formation of cerebral edema
   following burn injury. Plasma AVP upregulated AQP-4 expression in brain
   tissue, thereby promoting formation of cerebral edema.}},

Abstract = {{From a scientific point of view, the Juan Fernandez islands contain one
   of the most interesting floras of the planet. Although protected as a
   National Park and a World Biosphere Reserve, 400 years of human
   interference have left deep traces in the native plant communities.
   Repeated burning, overexploitation of species, and the introduction of
   animal and plant plagues have taken 75\% of the endemic vascular flora
   to the verge of extinction. In 1997, Chile's national forest service
   (Corporacion Nacional Forestal, CONAF) started an ambitious project,
   whose objective is the recovery of this highly complex ecosystem with a
   socio-ecological focus. Juan Fernandez makes an interesting case, as the
   local people (600 persons) practically live within the park, therefore
   impeding the exclusion of the people from any conservation program.
   Secondly, the relatively small size of the archipelago (100 km(2))
   permits the observation of the effects of whatever modification in the
   ecosystem on small scales in time and space. Thirdly, the native and
   introduced biota are interrelated in such a way that human-caused
   changes in one species population may provoke unexpected results amongst
   other, non-target species. The project mainly deals with the eradication
   or control of some animal and plant plagues, the active conservation and
   restoration of the flora and the inclusion of the local people in
   conservation planning. This article presents the park's general
   problems, the strategy proposed to resolve them as well as some
   preliminary results. This project shows the complexity of the
   conservation activities in practice, with diverse and complex
   interrelations and gaps in ecological knowledge. In this respect, the
   project may well serve as a model for similar programs in other places.}},

   bats through their effects on habitat quality for reproductive females.
   This project seeks to identify natural structures used by maternity
   colonies, determine criteria used in the selection of these roosts, and
   interpret how historic and current human activities may positively or
   negatively impact bat populations in the bosque. This paper reports
   first season results from this ongoing project. Thirteen reproductive
   female bats (5 little brown myotis, 5 Yuma myotis, 1 red bat, and 2
   pallid bats) captured on the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge
   in the summer of 1997 were radiotracked daily to their maternity roosts.
   Four little brown and Yuma myotis colony roosts were found. Colony size
   ranged from 90 to over 1800 bats. Two colonies were in manmade
   structures. Two other colonies and numerous solitary roosts were found
   in natural structures (dead cottonwoods). A pallid bat roosted in a
   rocky butte, and the red bat roosted in the foliage of a large, live
   cottonwood. Six of the nine tree roosts were in burned areas of forests
   directly along the river. Individuals and colonies of little brown and
   Yuma myotis used under-bark crevices and snags rather than more
   permanent types of roosts. Additional data from subsequent years will
   help determine whether the use of ephemeral bark roosts, snags, and
   riverside forests are characteristic of bat roost selection in the

Abstract = {{Disturbance of the vegetated land surface, due to factors such as fire,
   insect infestation, windthrow and harvesting, is a fundamental driver of
   the composition forested landscapes with information on disturbance
   providing critical insights into species composition, vegetation
   condition and structure. Long-term climate variability is expected to
   lead to increases in both the magnitude and distribution of
   disturbances. As a consequence it is important to develop monitoring
   systems to better understand these changes in the terrestrial biosphere
   as well to inform managers about disturbance agents more typically
   captured through specific monitoring programs (such as focused on
   insect. fire, or agricultural conditions). Changes in the condition,
   composition and distribution pattern of vegetation can lead to changes
   in the spectral and thermal signature of the land surface. Using a
   6-year time series of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index
   (EVI) data we apply a previously proposed Disturbance Index (DI) which
   has been shown to be sensitive to both continuous and discontinuous
   change. Using Canada as an example area, we demonstrate the capacity of
   this Disturbance Index to monitor land dynamics over time. As expected,
   our results confirm a significant relationship between area flagged as
   disturbed by the index and area burnt as estimated from other satellite
   sources (R(2)=0.78, p<0.0001). The DI also demonstrates a sensitivity to
   capture and depict changes related to insect infestations. Further, on a
   regional basis the DI produces change information matching measured
   wide-area moisture conditions (i.e., drought) and corresponding
   agricultural outputs. These findings indicate that for monitoring a
   large area, such as Canada, the time series based DI is a useful tool to
   aid in change detection and national monitoring activities. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Residual patches of forest remaining after natural or anthropogenic
   disturbance may facilitate regeneration of fragmented forest. However,
   residual patch function remains unclear, especially after natural
   wildfire. We investigate the role of residual boreal forest patches as
   refugia for bryophytes and ask the question, do they house bryophyte
   communities similar to those encountered in undisturbed forests?
   Bryophytes were sampled in three habitat types in black spruce boreal
   forests illustrating a gradient of disturbance severity: undisturbed
   forests, residual patches and burned matrices. Temporal, disturbance
   severity, spatial and structural variables of habitats were also
   recorded. Bryophyte community composition differed among habitat types
   with residual patches characterized by higher species richness, the loss
   of forest specialists and the addition of disturbance-prone species. The
   bryophyte community found in residual patches is at the interface
   between the communities of undisturbed forests and burned matrices. As
   residual patches did not conserve all species, particularly forest
   specialists, they were not refugia. However, we identify temporal,
   spatial and structural characteristics that can maintain bryophyte
   communities most similar to undisturbed forests and enhance residual
   patch ``refugia potential{''}. Residual patches enhance bryophyte
   diversity of the landscape housing species that cannot survive in the
   burned matrix. As conclusion we discuss the use of retention patches in
   harvested stands, together with the preservation of undisturbed stands
   that house singular bryophyte communities and especially sensitive
   forest specialists.}},

Abstract = {{Historic losses and fragmentation of tallgrass prairie habitat to
   agriculture and urban development have led to declines in diversity and
   abundance of plants and birds associated with such habitat. Prescribed
   burning is a management strategy that has potential for restoring and
   rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, and through such
   restoration, might create habitat for birds dependent upon prairies. To
   provide improved data for management decision-making regarding the use
   of prescribed fire in tallgrass prairies, we compared responses of plant
   and bird communities on five burned and five unburned tallgrass prairie
   fragments at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa, USA, from 1995
   to 1997. Overall species richness and diversity were unaffected by
   burning, but individual species of plants and birds were affected by
   year-treatment interactions, including northern bobwhite (Colinus
   virginianus) and ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), which
   showed time-delayed increases in density on burned sites. Analyses of
   species/area relationships indicated that, collectively, many small
   sites did make significant contributions to plant biodiversity at
   landscape levels, supporting the overall conservation value of prairie
   fragments. In contrast, most birds species were present on larger sites.
   Thus, higher biodiversity in bird communities which contain

   larger, more stable populations, greater habitat heterogeneity, and
   greater opportunity for niche separation.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire was investigated as a method for controlling ixodid and
   argasid ticks in chaparral habitats in northern California. Two
   experimental and two adjacent control plots within a wildlife preserve
   were monitored for 1 yr postburn. Ticks were collected by flagging
   vegetation, by CO2-baited pitfall trap, and by live-trapping rodents.
   Twice as many rodents were caught at control sites compared with burn
   sites and no dusky-footed woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes Baird, were found
   in the treatment sites postburn. This species is known to be a reservoir
   of the agents of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, sensu stricto
   Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt \& Brenner, and human granulocytic
   anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum Dumler, Barbet, Bekker, Dasch,
   Palmer, Ray, Rikihisa, Rurangirwa. Six ixodid tick species were removed
   from rodents (Ixodes pacificus Cooley \& Kohls, Ixodes jellisoni Cooley
   \& Kohls, Ixodes spinipalpis Hadwen \& Nuttall, Ixodes woodi Bishopp,
   Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, and Dermacentor parumapertus Neumann),
   two of which transmit bacterial zoonotic agents to people in the
   far-western United States. There was no decrease in number of ticks per
   animal trapped at either burn site compared with controls; in fact, the
   mean number of immature L pacificus per rodent was significantly higher
   at one burn site than its control site. Soil refugia may protect ticks
   from fire-induced mortality; the argasid tick Ornithodoros coriaceus
   Koch, which lives in soil, was unaffected by the prescribed fire as were
   L pacificus and D. occidentalis buried in packets 2.5 cm below ground.
   We conclude that although prescribed fires in chaparral habitats may
   diminish local rodent abundance, it does not decrease tick loads on
   rodents. Furthermore, burning chaparral does not result in a decreased
   abundance of adult ixodid ticks on vegetation and apparently does not
   affect argasid or ixodid ticks that are sheltered within soil refugia.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{299}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{Underlying the development and function of aspen forest communities are
   interactions between aspen and a broad suite of plant species. These
   plant plant interactions can be facilitative or antagonistic in nature
   and their influence varies depending on multiple environmental factors
   that are changing with human activity. The purpose of this synthesis
   paper is to identify the patterns, mechanisms and consequences of
   facilitation and competition in aspen communities and how they vary
   based on environmental conditions and different aspen forest types.
   Across its expansive range, aspen commonly associate with conifers to
   form mixed forests. There is increasing evidence that facilitation in
   early stand development alters competitive interactions between aspen
   and conifers in later stages of development. However, the influences of
   facilitation and competition vary depending on conifer species and aspen
   forest type. In drier, montane aspen forests of the western US, shade
   and higher moisture content at the base of aspen trees facilitate the
   germination and survival of young fir seedlings. This facilitation
   effect increases the proximity of aspen and fir which over time creates
   competitive interactions that favor conifer dominance. In the more mesic
   conditions of eastern Canada, aspen also promotes fir establishment but
   the facilitation effect occurs at the stand level and is most likely
   driven by increased light penetration and more optimal edaphic
   conditions rather than by mitigating moisture limitations. In the
   western and central boreal forest, successional transitions are
   primarily driven by competitive effects in which short fire cycles and
   competitive inhibition of spruce favors aspen dominance.
   Positive and antagonistic interactions between aspen and associated
   plant species are influenced by environmental conditions that fluctuate
   according to nature processes and human perturbations. In this review we
   discuss the impact that plant invasions, global change factors, fire
   regimes and herbivory have on plant plant interactions in aspen forest
   and how they modify successional outcomes. The literature suggests that
   aspen's competitive ability is strongly influenced by rising CO2,
   temperatures, drought and ozone. Conditions resulting in longer fire
   cycles will tend to promote losses in aspen cover through competitive
   exclusion through conifer expansion. Finally, competition alters aspen
   susceptibility to herbivory which is a major threat to aspen resilience
   in some parts of its range. Identifying the environmental conditions
   that create the proper balance between facilitative and competitive
   interactions is paramount in formulating management approaches that
   promote resilient aspen forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim Temporally replicated observations are essential for the calibration
   and validation of species distribution models (SDMs) aiming at making
   temporal extrapolations. We study here the usefulness of a
   general-purpose monitoring programme for the calibration of hybrid SDMs.
   As a benchmark case, we take the calibration with data from a monitoring
   programme that specifically surveys those areas where environmental
   changes expected to be relevant occur. Location Catalonia, north-east of
   Spain. Methods We modelled the distribution changes of twelve
   open-habitat bird species in landscapes whose dynamics are driven by
   fire and forest regeneration. We developed hybrid SDMs combining
   correlative habitat suitability with mechanistic occupancy models. We
   used observations from two monitoring programmes to provide
   maximum-likelihood estimates for spread parameters: a common breeding
   bird survey (CBS) and a programme specifically designed to monitor bird
   communities within areas affected by wildfires (DINDIS). Results Both
   calibration with CBS and DINDIS data yielded sound spread parameter
   estimates and range dynamics that suggested dispersal limitations.
   However, compared to calibration with DINDIS data, calibration with CBS
   data leads to biased estimates of spread distance for seven species and
   to a higher degree of uncertainty in predicted range dynamics for six
   species. Main conclusions We have shown that available monitoring data
   can be used in the calibration of the mechanistic component of hybrid
   SDMs. However, if the dynamics of the target species occur within areas
   not well covered, general-purpose monitoring data can lead to biased and
   inaccurate parameter estimates. To determine the potential usefulness of
   a given monitoring data set for the calibration of the mechanistic
   component of a hybrid SDM, we recommend quantifying the number of

   variable climate. Modifying a historical runoff model, we constructed
   scenarios to estimate increases in runoff from thinning ponderosa pine
   at the landscape and watershed scales based on driving variables: pace,
   extent and intensity of forest treatments and variability in winter
   precipitation. We found that runoff on thinned forests was about 20\%
   greater than unthinned forests, regardless of whether treatments
   occurred in a drought or pluvial period. The magnitude of this increase
   is similar to observed declines in snowpack for the region, suggesting
   that accelerated thinning may lessen runoff losses due to warming
   effects. Gains in runoff were temporary (six years after treatment) and
   modest when compared to mean annual runoff from the study watersheds
   (0-3\%). Nonetheless gains observed during drought periods could play a
   role in augmenting river flows on a seasonal basis, improving conditions
   for water-dependent natural resources, as well as benefit water supplies
   for downstream communities. Results of this study and others suggest
   that accelerated forest thinning at large scales could improve the water
   balance and resilience of forests and sustain the ecosystem services
   they provide.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in fire frequency are disrupting many ecological communities
   not historically subjected to fire. In the southwestern United States,
   the blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima) community is among the most
   threatened, often replaced by invasive annual grasses after fire. This
   long-lived shrub is vulnerable because it recruits sporadically,
   partially due to mast seeding and the absence of a seed bank. The goal
   of this study was to evaluate if shrub restoration can be enhanced by
   identifying and ameliorating recruitment limitations. Specifically, we
   tested the effect of encapsulating seeds in predation-deterring ``seed
   balls.{''} We also tested the effects of nurse plants and mammalian
   exclusion cages on seedling emergence, growth, and survivorship. These
   experiments were conducted in a full-factorial design across three sites
   differing in elevation. Over 2 years, 13\% of all planted seeds emerged
   and the effect of seed balls was overwhelmingly negative because of low
   emergence. Nurse plants had overall positive effects at Low Elevation,
   but negative effects at Mid- and High Elevation. Emergence and survival
   were highest in caged plots everywhere, and effect sizes increased with
   elevation. Interactions between the cage and the nurse plant treatments
   indicated that nurse plants tended to attract mammalian predators,
   lowering emergence and seedling survivorship, particularly at higher
   elevations. Findings conform to the stress-gradient hypothesis in that
   interactions among seedlings and mature plants shifted from facilitation
   to competition as environmental stress decreased with increasing
   elevation, suggesting that they are transferable to ecologically similar
   communities elsewhere. Knowledge of site-specific recruitment
   limitations can help minimize ineffective restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Within the range of the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), the
   only bird species endemic to Florida, there was a need for a population
   risk assessment that considered the impacts of declining habitat
   availability and declining fire frequency associated with rapid human
   population expansion. We developed a population risk model to examine
   influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes),
   and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations.
   Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased
   from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for
   coastal populations by 10-30\% compared to inland populations. Our
   results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely to support
   a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality
   conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire
   suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more
   effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred
   slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal
   conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of
   experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most
   important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers
   were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because
   an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small
   population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay
   vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is
   protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide reforestation has been recommended as a landscape restoration
   strategy to mitigate climate change in areas where the climate can

   unique biodiversity as such policies are based on the false assumption
   that most grasslands are man-made. Here, we use multiple lines of

   Management and Restoration, Perth, AUSTRALIA, OCT 25-27, 2005}},
Abstract = {{This review summarises scientific knowledge concerning the mycorrhizal
   associations, pollination, demographics, genetics and evolution of
   Australian terrestrial orchids relevant to conservation. The orchid
   family is highly diverse in Western Australia (WA), with over 400
   recognised taxa of which 76 are Declared Rare or Priority Flora. Major
   threats to rare orchids in WA include habitat loss, salinity, feral
   animals and drought. These threats require science-based recovery
   actions resulting from collaborations between universities, government
   agencies and community groups.
   Fungal identification by DNA-based methods in combination with
   compatibility testing by germination assays has revealed a complex
   picture of orchid-fungus diversity and specificity. The majority of rare
   and common WA orchids studied have highly specific mycorrhizal
   associations with fungi in the Rhizoctonia alliance, but some associate
   with a wider diversity of fungi. These fungi may be a key factor
   influencing the distribution of orchids and their presence can be tested
   by orchid seed bait bioassays. These bioassays show that mycorrhizal
   fungi are concentrated in coarse organic matter that may be depleted in
   some habitats (e.g. by frequent fire). Mycorrhizal fungi also allow
   efficient propagation of terrestrial orchids for reintroduction into
   natural habitats and for bioassays to test habitat quality.
   Four categories of WA orchids are defined by the following pollination
   strategies: (i) nectar-producing flowers with diverse pollinators, (ii)
   non-rewarding flowers that mimic other plants, (iii) winter-flowering
   orchids that attract fungus-feeding insects and (iv) sexually deceptive
   orchids with relatively specific pollinators. An exceptionally high
   proportion of WA orchids have specific insect pollinators. Bioassays
   testing orchid-pollinator specificity can define habitats and separate
   closely related species. Other research has revealed the chemical basis
   for insect attraction to orchids and the ecological consequences of
   deceptive pollination. Genetic studies have revealed that the structure
   of orchid populations is influenced by pollination, seed dispersal,
   reproductive isolation and hybridisation. Long-term demographic studies
   determine the viability of orchid populations, estimate rates of
   transition between seedling, flowering, non-flowering and dormant states
   and reveal factors, such as grazing and competition, that result in
   declining populations.
   It is difficult to define potential new habitats for rare orchids
   because of their specific relationships with fungi and insects. An
   understanding of all three dimensions of orchid habitat requirements can
   be provided by bioassays with seed baits for fungi, flowers for insects
   and transplanted seedlings for orchid demography. The majority of both
   rare and common WA orchids have highly specific associations with
   pollinating insects and mycorrhizal fungi, suggesting that evolution has
   favoured increasing specificity in these relationships in the ancient
   landscapes of WA.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Drought and heat-induced tree mortality is accelerating in many forest
   biomes as a consequence of a warming climate, resulting in a threat to
   global forests unlike any in recorded history(1-12). Forests store the
   majority of terrestrial carbon, thus their loss may have significant and
   sustained impacts on the global carbon cycle(11,12). We use a hydraulic
   corollary to Darcys law, a core principle of vascular plant
   physiology(13), to predict characteristics of plants that will survive
   and die during drought under warmer future climates. Plants that are
   tall with isohydric stomatal regulation, low hydraulic conductance, and
   high leaf area are most likely to die from future drought stress. Thus,
   tall trees of old-growth forests are at the greatest risk of loss, which
   has ominous implications for terrestrial carbon storage. This
   application of Darcys law indicates todays forests generally should be
   replaced by shorter and more xeric plants, owing to future warmer
   droughts and associated wildfires and pest attacks. The Darcys corollary
   also provides a simple, robust framework for informing forest management
   interventions needed to promote the survival of current forests. Given
   the robustness of Darcys law for predictions of vascular plant function,
   we conclude with high certainty that todays forests are going to be
   subject to continued increases in mortality rates that will result in
   substantial reorganization of their structure and carbon storage.}},

Volume = {{233}},
Pages = {{118-130}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Deforestation in the tropics is often followed by the creation of
   anthropogenic savannas used for animal husbandry. By discontinuing
   burning regimes, forests may recolonize the savanna and carbon stocks
   may recover. However, little is known about the success and speed of
   tropical forest recovery, while such information is vital for a better
   quantification of efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and
   forest degradation (REDD +) as well as supporting Forest Landscape
   Restoration (FLR) practices. Therefore, we designed a forest
   regeneration experiment within a savanna patch in the Mayombe hills
   (Democratic Republic of Congo), by discontinuing the annual burning
   regime in an 88 ha exclosure since 2005. 101 permanent inventory plots
   (40.4 ha) were installed in 2010 and remeasured in 2014. Tree species
   were classified as savanna or forest specialists. We estimate a forest
   specialist encroachment rate of 9 stems ha(-1) yr(-1) and a savanna
   specialist disappearance rate of 16 stems ha(-1) yr(-1). Average
   diameter of forest specialists did not change due to an increasing
   influx of recruits, while average diameter of savanna trees increased
   due to decreasing recruitment. Carbon stored by forest specialists
   increased from 3.12 to 5.60 Mg C ha(-1), suggesting a forest carbon
   recovery rate of 0.62 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Using the average carbon stock
   of 19 nearby mature rainforest plots as a reference, we estimate a total
   forest carbon recovery time of at least 150 years. The Manzonzi
   exclosure may potentially become an important reference experiment to
   quantify REDD + schemes in Central Africa. Furthermore, this natural
   regeneration experiment demonstrates how carbon sequestration and
   biodiversity conservation can go hand-in-hand. However, more censuses
   are needed to better quantify the long-term carbon recovery trajectory

Journal = {{NORTHWEST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{128-140}},
Abstract = {{A variety of Forest Health and Protection treatments have been proposed
   to reduce long-term risks to forests from wildfire, insects, and
   disease. This review examines the potential effects of these treatments
   on sediment production in watersheds, channel forming processes,
   riparian vegetation, and risks posed to riparian zones. Wildfires can
   affect upland erosion; however, erosion from prescribed fires burning
   the same area should be much smaller. Dense riparian vegetation might
   help regulate the amount of sediment that reaches streams, but this
   effect would be strongly dependent on the geomorphic setting. Forest
   pathogens are not expected to cause accelerated erosion and stream
   sedimentation directly, but indirect effects might be substantial if
   they lead to increased wildfire. The largest risk of accelerated erosion
   is expected from ground-disturbing activities during fuels reduction
   treatments, such as construction of roads and firebreaks or salvage
   logging or thinning. Intense grazing has changed composition and cover
   of riparian vegetation, leading to bank erosion, and in many places,
   widening or incision of stream channels. Improved grazing prescriptions
   can result in major changes to riparian vegetation, but response of
   channel morphology will most likely be slow. Most of the studies
   reviewed were conducted at the site or small-watershed scale.
   Consequently, conclusions at these scales are generally well supported
   by the available literature. The cumulative effects of forest health and
   protection treatments imposed across a large region are difficult to
   assess, however. Given the current state of knowledge, dramatically
   changing forest land-use practices across eastern Oregon and
   Washington-including the widespread use of prescribed fires, salvage
   logging, and mechanical fuel treatments-is a long-term, landscape-scale
   experiment, the cumulative effects of which are unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence and fall rate of snags (standing dead trees) generated
   during bark beetle outbreaks have consequences for the behavior,
   effects, and suppression of potential wildfires, hazard tree and timber
   salvage operations, wildlife habitat, and numerous ecosystem processes.
   However, post-beetle snagfall dynamics are poorly understood in most
   forest types. We tagged standing live and dead lodgepole pine (Pinus
   contorta), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and Engelmann spruce (Picea
   engelmannii), including beetle-killed pine snags following the peak of a
   recent mountain pine bark beetle outbreak in watersheds at the Fraser
   Experimental Forest in northcentral Colorado and sampled snagfall 10 and
   12 years later. Bark beetle attacks began in 2003, peaked by 2006, and
   killed 78\% of overstory lodgepole pine in 133 plots distributed across
   a range of stand and site conditions. Of those snags, only 17\% fell
   between 2007 and 2018. Most snags broke at ground level, due to butt
   rot, and were oriented downhill. In contrast, snags that tipped up or
   snapped off above the ground were oriented with the prevailing winds.
   Equal numbers of snags fell singly and in multiple-tree groups, and
   equal numbers remained elevated rather than in contact with the ground.
   Lodgepole pine snagfall was 1.6-times higher on steep slopes (>40\%)
   where dead pine density was higher, compared to flatter sites. Based on
   our findings and previous research, we estimate that one-half the
   beetle-killed lodgepole pine in high-elevation forests such as those at
   Fraser may fall within 15-20 yr of beetle infestation, but that some
   pine snags are likely to persist for decades longer. Post-outbreak
   snagfall dynamics create a multiple-decade legacy of bark beetle
   outbreaks that will persist longer in high-elevation compared to
   lower-elevation forests.}},

Abstract = {{The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) uses the five-leaf
   developmental stage as a signal to the initiation of elongation in
   smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.). In areas where certain plant
   community criteria are met, conducting a prescribed burn at elongation
   onset has reduced smooth brome populations. However, leaf stage
   identification presents USFWS managers with challenges due to the
   variability of smooth brome development in tallgrass prairies of the
   Northern Great Plains. The objective of this research was to develop an
   alternative method to determine when smooth brome populations reach the
   targeted 50\% elongation by linking accumulated growing degree days and
   population-level plant phenological stages (mean stage count). We
   determined smooth brome phenological stages at sites in North Dakota,
   South Dakota, and Minnesota and calculated the corresponding number of
   growing degree days (using the base temperature of 0 degrees C). Linear
   regression models, correlating phenological stage and growing degree
   days, determined onset of elongation in the smooth brome population,
   regardless of leaf stage variation. The average accumulated growing
   degree days (1256 AGDD) and corresponding standard deviation (+/- 155
   AGDD) can be used to predict when 95\% of smooth brome populations in
   northern tallgrass prairies reach 50\% elongation. As part of USFWS
   Native Prairie Adaptive Management program, results will be used to
   assist management decisions regarding the timing of defoliation in an

Abstract = {{Extrafloral nectar (EFN) mediates food-for-protection mutualisms between

   Both biotic and abiotic factors, therefore, affect the outcome of
   ant-plant interactions. We conducted an experiment to determine the
   effects of ant activity, and light intensity, on herbivory rates,
   growth, and reproductive fitness in Senna mexicana var. chapmanii, a
   perennial legume native to pine rockland habitats of south Florida.
   Forty plants were divided among four treatments in a factorial
   experimental design with two independent variables: ant activity and
   light intensity. Plants were divided equally between sunny and shady
   habitats, and ants were excluded from half of the plants in each habitat
   type. The presence of ants significantly reduced herbivory rates in
   S.chapmanii. In shaded habitats, the presence of ants had no effect on
   plant reproductive fitness, however, in sunny habitats plants with ants
   produced significantly more seeds over the duration of the 1-yr study.
   Ants represent an important biotic defense against herbivores in
   S.chapmanii; however, their effects on plant fitness are dependent on
   light conditions. Pine rockland habitats in south Florida have been
   widely destroyed or mismanaged. In fragments that remain, suppression of
   fire has led to increased canopy closure and shading of the understory.
   These changes will likely negatively impact plants that rely on ants for
   defense. We highlight the importance of conservation efforts to preserve
   the pine rocklands and the fire regimes on which they rely.}},

Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes reflect the size, shape, composition, and juxtaposition of
   habitats. The pattern of landscapes helps determine which bird species
   inhabit them. Understanding the relationships between birds and
   different landscapes may be very important in helping us manage and
   maintain bird diversity. Current landscape patterns are the result of
   each landscape's configuration prior to human settlement and its later
   use by humans. Landscapes differ from each other in distinct regions of
   the United States, likely requiring different management approaches. In
   the eastern United States, many forest habitats become fragmented when
   habitats surrounding woodlots are converted into residential
   developments and croplands. In the western United States, the emphasis
   is on the habitats on public lands, which become fragmented when
   older-aged forests are replaced by younger forests after logging.
   Old-growth stands often end up surrounded by forests of different ages.
   The amount and continuity of old-growth coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii var. menziesii) forests, or those west of the Cascade crest in
   Washington, Oregon and California, have decreased substantially since
   presettlement times, primarily due to clearcut logging. Although a few
   bird species (e.g., the northern spotted owl: Strix occidentalis
   caurina) are clearly less abundant in fragmented areas, other bird
   species currently are more abundant in the more fragmented areas. This
   may indicate that birds are `'packing'' into the remaining desirable
   fragments as adjacent areas are logged.
   Landscape patterns are complex in the Northern Rocky Mountains
   (specifically the Intermountain Ranges subregion of Montana and adjacent
   Idaho). Forest stands of many different ages are intermixed with
   grasslands, recently logged areas, riparian areas, agricultural fields,
   and housing areas, The current composition of forest landscapes is the
   result of fires of varying intensities, managed fire suppression (more
   recently), and different types of logging. Although logging has
   decreased the total amount of old-growth ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa), suppression of wildfire has probably increased the total
   amount of mature and old-growth inland Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii var. glauca) in some parts of the Northern Rockies. Also in
   the Northern Rockies, several bird species are more abundant in forests
   that include and are surrounded by a larger amount of old growth than in
   areas with less old growth. Other species seem influenced by the

   Forest managers can consider landscape patterns, habitat type (e.g., old
   growth), and microhabitat features within a given habitat (e.g., snags)
   while planning management strategies to perpetuate birds. Species that
   evolved in association with a particular landscape pattern or a natural
   process such as fire probably can be perpetuated by maintaining natural
   landscape patterns and ecological processes.}},

Abstract = {{We studied how two methods to promote biodiversity in managed forests,
   i.e. green tree retention and prescribed fire, affect the assemblages of
   carabid beetles. Our experiment consisted of 24 study sites, each 3-5 ha
   in size, which had been prepared according to factorial design. Each of
   the eight treatment combinations determined by the two factors explored
   - tree retention level (0, 10, 50 m(3)/ha(-1) and uncut controls) and
   prescribed use of fire (yes/no) - was replicated three times. We sampled
   carabids using pitfall traps one year after the treatments.
   Significantly more individuals were caught in most of the burned sites,
   but this difference was partially reflective of the trap-catches of
   Pterostichus adstrictus. The fire did not increase no. of P. adstrictus
   in the uncut sites as much as in the other sites. Species richness was
   significantly affected by both factors, being higher in the burned than
   in the unburned sites and in the harvested than in the unharvested
   sites. Many species were concentrated in the groups of retention trees
   in the burned sites, but only a few were in the unburned sites. The
   species turnover was greater in the burned than in the unburned sites,
   as indicated by the NMDS ordinations. Greater numbers of smaller sized
   species and proportion of brachypterous species were present in the
   burned sites. Fire-favored species, and also the majority of other
   species that prefer open habitats were more abundantly caught in the
   burned sites than in the unburned sites. Dead wood or logging waste
   around the traps did not correlate with the occurrence of species. We
   conclude that carabids are well adapted to disturbances, and that
   frequent use of prescribed fire is essential for the maintenance of
   natural assemblages of carabid beetles in the boreal forest. Small
   retention tree groups can not maintain assemblages of uncut forest, but
   they can be important by providing food, shelter and breeding sites for
   many species, particularly in the burned sites.}},

Abstract = {{Recent large-scale wildfires have increased populations of wood-boring

   about possible impacts of wood-boring insects in the Black Hills, land
   managers are interested in developing monitoring techniques such, as

   semiochemical attractants were tested in a recently burned ponderosa
   pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws., forest in the Black Hills.
   Modified panel and funnel traps were tested in combination with the
   attractants, which included a woodborer standard (ethanol and a-pinene),
   standard plus 3-carene, standard plus ipsenol, and standard plus
   ipsdienol. We found that funnel traps were equally efficient or more
   efficient in capturing wood-boring insects than modified panel traps.
   Trap catches of cerambycids increased when we added the Ips spp.
   pheromone components (ipsenol or ipsdienol) or the host monoterpene
   (3-carene) to the woodborer standard. During the summers of 2003 and

   Two other cerambycids, Acanthocinus obliquus (LeConte) and Acmaeops

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance and the subsequent
   heterogeneity are critical in maintaining biodiversity within grassland
   ecosystems. Grassland birds have evolved within this `shifting mosaic'
   to become reliant on specific habitat characteristics maintained under
   varying levels of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance.
   Unfortunately, grasslands in South Africa have been extensively
   transformed and remain poorly conserved, threatening grassland avifauna.
   Mistbelt grassland is a threatened vegetation type endemic to the
   province of KwaZulu-Natal, of which only 0.3\% is formally protected.
   This study investigated seasonal and patch type heterogeneity in a
   Mistbelt grassland avian community by determining avian community
   structure and composition in four patch types, i.e.i) untransformed open
   grassland, burnt grassland, iii) bramble-invaded and, iv)
   bramble-cleared grassland, during winter and summer. Avian assemblages
   were significantly different between the different patch types for each
   season. The bramble patch type negatively affected grassland bird
   species diversity Bramble-cleared grassland and untransformed grassland
   had similar vegetation structure and avian communities in the summer,
   suggesting that the grassland bird community benefitted soon after the
   clearing of invasive vegetation. This study provides further evidence
   that bird diversity is enhanced in structurally heterogeneous grassland
   landscapes. Furthermore, the protection and appropriate management of
   privately owned Mistbelt grassland, conserved in the form of rangeland,
   is an important refuge for threatened and endemic avifauna, such as the
   globally-threatened blue swallow (Hirundo atrocaerulea) and wattled
   crane (Bugeranus carunculatus).}},

Abstract = {{Mountain forest ecosystems in central Europe are a product of millennia
   of land use and climate change, and this historical legacy shapes their
   vulnerability to projected climate change and related disturbance
   regimes (e.g. fire, wind throw, insect outbreaks). The transitional and
   highly dynamic state of present-day forests raises questions about the
   use of modern ecological observations and modeling approaches to predict
   their response to future climate change. We draw on records from the
   different subregions (northern, central and southern Alps and their
   forelands) in and around the Swiss Alps, which has one of the longest
   evidence of human land-use in Europe, to illustrate the importance of
   paleoecological information for guiding forest management and
   conservation strategies. The records suggest that past land use had
   different impacts on the abundance and distribution of woody species,
   depending on their ecology and economic value. Some taxas were
   disadvantaged by intensified burning and browsing (e.g. Abies alba,
   Ulmus, Tilia, Fraxinus, Pinus cembra and the evergreen Ilex aquifolium
   and Hedera helix); others were selected for food and fiber (e.g.
   Castanea sativa, Juglans regia) or increased in abundance as consequence
   of their utility (charcoal, acorns, litter and other products) or
   resistance to disturbance (e.g. Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus
   sylvestris, and deciduous Quercus). Another group of trees increased in
   distribution as an indirect result of human-caused disturbance (e.g.
   Betula, Alnus viridis, Juniperus, and Pinus mugo). Knowledge of past
   species distribution, abundance and responses under a wide range of
   climate, land use and disturbance conditions is critical for setting
   silvicultural priorities to maintain healthy forests in the future. (C)

   Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) dominated the tick
   population while Ixodes scapularis Say was not encountered. There were
   complex differences in tick populations among site conditions. After
   prescribed burning, the tick population size was small but was larger in
   subsequent 2- and 5-year post-burn sites. An increase in Odocoileus
   virginianus foraging in recently burned sites is likely responsible for
   this phenomenon. WUI areas had the largest tick populations likely due
   to Odocoileus virginianus activity in an area that provides cover,
   forage, and a connection to a wildlife refuge. It is possible that the
   likelihood of humans coming in contact with ticks and tick-borne
   diseases is greater in WUI areas than in unbroken contiguous forest. A.
   americanum showed a positive correlation with percent cover of grass and

Abstract = {{Sagebrush plays an important role in the ecological functions of
   sagebrush steppe plant communities and is a necessary component of
   habitat for a variety of wildlife including greater sage-grouse
   (Centrocercus urophasianus). At lower elevations, increased fire
   frequency associated with exotic annual grass invasion has heightened
   the need for effective sagebrush restoration strategies, but existing
   techniques have been largely ineffective. Our objective was to evaluate
   ``pile seeding{''} (placing mature seed heads on the ground) of Wyoming
   big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis) as an
   alternative to broadcast seeding. We used a randomized block design
   (n=.5) replicated in 2 yr at two contrasting ecological sites in
   southeastern Oregon. Treatments applied to 100 X 1.5 m plots included 1)
   pile seeding (four mature seed heads center dot pile(-1) x 10 piles
   center dot plot(-1)), 2) broadcast seeding (0.5 kg pure live seed
   {[}PLS] center dot ha(-1)), and 3) natural recovery (i.e., nonseeded).
   Planting occurred in fall 2008 and 2009, and plots were monitored for
   seedling establishment for three or two growing seasons postplanting.
   Seedling density was estimated at the plot scale within a SO-cm radius
   of each seed head pile ({''}island scale{''}). In the year following
   planting, sagebrush seedling density at the plot scale was up to 60-fold
   higher (P <= 0.05) in pile-seeded plots compared to natural recovery and
   broadcast plots. Seedling mortality was high (up to 98\% reduction in
   density) for pile-seeded plots between the first and second growing
   seasons postplanting and differences between broadcast and pile-seeded
   plots dissipated by 2-3 yr postplanting. Although pile-seeding had
   higher initial density than broadcast seeding, neither technique had
   sufficient multiyear survival to suggest restoration efficacy at the
   plot scale. Seedling density at the island scale suggests that
   pile-seeding may be useful for establishing sagebrush islands, depending
   on year conditions. Research is needed to determine strategies capable
   of increasing long-term sagebrush seedling survival.}},

Abstract = {{Fires occur frequently in dry forests of the Inland West. Fire effects

   We evaluated 487 plots across a 47 000 ha landscape using three criteria
   to identify historical fire refugia: different structure from
   surrounding matrix; different fire regime from surrounding matrix;
   presence of old individuals of fire-intolerant tree species. Several
   combinations of aspect, elevation, and topography best predicted
   refugial presence.
   Less than 20\% of the pre-settlement landscape was identified as
   historical fire refugia. Refugia were not connected except by younger

Abstract = {{We examined the historical record of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus

   for the 25-years period leading up to the 1988 Yellowstone fires
   (1963-86) to determine how prior beetle activity and the resulting tree
   mortality affected the spatial pattern of the 1988 Yellowstone fires. To
   obtain accurate estimates of our model parameters, we used a Markov
   chain Monte Carlo method to account for the high degree of spatial
   autocorrelation inherent to forest fires. Our final model included three
   statistically significant variables: drought, aspect, and sustained
   mountain pine beetle activity in the period 1972-75. Of the two major
   mountain pine beetle outbreaks that preceded the 1988 fires, the earlier
   outbreak (1972-75) was significantly correlated with the burn pattern,
   whereas the more recent one (1980-83) was not. Although regional drought
   and high winds were responsible for the large scale of this event, the
   analysis indicates that mountain pine beetle activity in the mid-1970s
   increased the odds of burning in 1988 by 11\% over unaffected areas.
   Although relatively small in magnitude, this effect, combined with the
   effects of aspect and spatial variation in drought, had a dramatic

Abstract = {{The central rock-rat Zyzomys pedunculatus is categorized as Critically

   sites in 2002, coincident with the onset of drought conditions and
   extensive wildfires. With concern growing for the survival of the
   species, we sought to locate an extant population. During 2009-2012 we
   surveyed sites throughout the western sector of the West MacDonnell
   National Park, including sites where rock-rats had previously been
   recorded. From a total of 55 sites and 5,000 trap nights we located
   eight central rock-rats from only five sites (overall detection rate =
   0.16 rock-rats per loo trap nights). All sites were on two mountain-top
   locations, both of which are over 1,250 m altitude. Evidence of
   reproductive activity was observed at both locations but the
   subpopulations were relatively localized and no individuals were
   captured at any of the sites from which the species was known previous
   to these surveys. Although the rugged mountains may provide the central
   rock-rat with some refuge from predation and wildfires, more research is
   needed to understand better the factors suppressing and constraining the
   species at the population and landscape scales. Immediate management
   priorities are prescribed burning to limit the extent and severity of

   them grow in the wild. Leaves are harvested mainly by women and children
   for household consumption as famine food and are also sold in the local
   markets. Despite their importance, these plants are threatened by
   over-harvesting, cutting, animal browsing, and bushfires. In order to
   increase edible plant availability, it is recommended that farmers,
   agricultural agents, and extension technicians work together to promote
   the husbandry and the use of these underexploited plants. The findings
   of the study could be a starting point for participatory and sustainable
   agricultural development in the study zone. Botanical gardens creation
   for ex situ conservation of the leafy vegetable species genetic
   resources deserves more attention.}},

Abstract = {{The southwestern region of the Yukon Territory of Canada has experienced
   an unprecedented spruce bark beetle outbreak (Dendroctonus rufipennis)
   and an increase in the frequency of forest fires that extend beyond
   historical trends and that have caused significant impacts on forest
   structure and composition. A Strategic Forest Management Plan (SFMP) for
   the Champagne and Aishihik Traditional Territory located in the
   southwest Yukon was implemented in 2004 in response to the spruce bark
   beetle (D. rufipennis) infestation and increased fire risk. The plan has
   recommended salvage harvesting of beetle-killed stands as a strategy to
   facilitate the development of a timber industry in the region and reduce
   the fire risk around communities. One of the objectives of the SFMP is
   to maintain, restore, or enhance forest regeneration, which requires an
   understanding of regeneration dynamics in the region. In this study, we
   investigated the regeneration of white spruce (Picea glauca), trembling
   aspen (Populus tremuloides), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) and
   the relationship with climatic, disturbance, and edaphic factors within
   the region. Multivariate canonical correlation analysis was used to
   assess the weighted relationship between regeneration presence/absence
   and environmental factors, and negative binomial regression analysis was
   used to model regeneration abundance of white spruce, trembling aspen,
   and balsam poplar. We found that although regeneration of all three
   species responded positively to disturbance, the broadleaved species
   occupied disturbed plots at higher ratios than white spruce.
   Regeneration of broadleaved species was higher in open sites with
   exposed aspects, indicating a preference for warmer sites with higher
   solar radiation inputs. These findings support the hypothesis that if
   fire increased in the region with the warmer climate predicted by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, then the region will probably
   experience an increase in broadleaved species, leading to a more
   heterogeneous landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury plays a critical role in serious health problems due to
   environmental or occupational exposures. Aquatic ecosystems are an
   essential component of the global biogeochemical cycle of mercury, as
   inorganic mercury can be converted to toxic methyl mercury in these
   environments and remissions of elemental mercury rival anthro pogenic
   mercury releases on a global scale.
   The history of the Minamata disease, a typical example of industrial
   pollution, has shown how corporate secrecy and ignorance on part of the
   health authorities may influence the devastating spread of environmental
   contamination and the progress of disease. While the Minamata
   Convention, in place since 2017, is aiming to lower mercury exposure and
   to prevent adverse effects, there are still knowledge gaps in the areas
   of global environmental mercury exposure. Areas of uncertainty in the
   global biogeochemical cycle of mercury include oxidation processes in
   the atmosphere, land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere cyding, and
   methylation processes in the ocean. Pollution related to climate change
   (especially in boreal and arctic regions), bioaccumulation and
   biomagnification of methyl mercury in the food chain, especially in fish
   and marine mammals, needs to be addressed in more detail information is
   lacking on numerous hidden contaminant exposures i.e. from globally

   dental amalgam, ethyl mercury containing vaccines and latex paint
   additives, as well as on mercury releases from power plants,
   e-waste/fluorescent lamps, wildfire emissions, and global artisanal
   small-scale gold mining activities.
   Mercury occurs in various forms with different levels of toxicity. While
   much is already known and documented on the health effects of mercury,
   present knowledge and translation into preventive actions is still
   incomplete. Risks for long term health effects trough prolonged low dose
   exposure and trough cumulative exposures of various mercury forms should
   be further addressed. Preventive actions should include adequate human
   biomonitoring programs. Research data should be translated swiftly into
   management tools for local policy makers and health professionals, also
   paying attention at the major differences in mercury contamination
   across the globe. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation structure is identified as an important biodiversity
   indicator providing the physical environment that generates, supports,
   and maintains forest biodiversity. Airborne lidar systems (light
   detection and ranging) have the capacity to accurately measure
   three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in
   wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling. Large-area
   structural inventories using lidar-derived variables that characterize
   generic habitat structure have rarely been done, yet would be helpful
   for guiding biodiversity monitoring and conservation assessments of
   species at regional levels. This study provides a novel approach for
   processing regional-scale lidar data into categorical classes
   representing natural groupings of habitat structure. We applied cluster
   analysis on six lidar-derived habitat-related variables to classify
   vegetation structure into eight classes for the forested areas of ten
   natural subregions in boreal and foothill forests in Alberta, Canada.
   Structure classes were compared across different natural subregions and
   under anthropogenic/non-anthropogenic disturbance regimes. We found that
   the Lower Foothills Natural Subregions had the most complex vegetation
   structure, and wildfire was the most prevalent disturbance agent for all
   classes except for the rarest class (i.e. stands with high standard
   deviations of height and low canopy cover) which was more heavily
   altered by timber harvesting. This data product provides continuous,
   regional mapping of vegetation structure directly measured from lidar,
   with a spatial resolution (30 m) relatively finer than what was provided
   by polygon-based forest inventories. This vegetation structure
   classification and its associated spatial distribution address the
   fundamental issue of habitat structure in biodiversity monitoring. It
   can serve as a base layer used together with species and land cover data
   for forest resources planning, species distribution and animal movement
   modeling, as well as prioritization of conservation efforts on critical
   habitat structures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Habitats of Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have
   declined across western North America, and most remaining habitats occur
   on lands administered by the U.S. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Bureau of
   Land Management (BLM). Consequently, managers of FS-BLM lands need
   effective strategies to recover sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitats on
   which this species depends. In response to this need, we evaluated the
   potential benefits of two restoration scenarios on Greater Sage-Grouse
   in the interior Columbia Basin and adjacent portions of the Great Basin
   of the western United States. Scenario 1 assumed a 50\% reduction in
   detrimental grazing effects (through changes in stocking rates and
   grazing systems) and a six-fold increase in areas treated with active
   restoration (e.g., prescribed burning, native seedings, wildfire
   suppression) compared with future management proposed by the FS-BLM.
   Scenario 2 assumed a 100\% reduction in detrimental grazing effects and
   the same increase in active restoration as scenario 1. To evaluate
   benefits, we estimated the risk of population extirpation for sage
   grouse 100 years in the future under the two scenarios and compared this
   risk with that estimated for proposed (100-year) FS-BLM management. We
   used estimates of extirpation risk for historical (circa 1850-1890) and
   current time periods as a context for our comparison. Under historical
   conditions, risk of extirpation was very low on FS-BLM lands, but
   increased to a moderate probability under current conditions. Under
   proposed FS-BLM management, risk of extirpation on FS-BLM lands
   increased to a high probability 100 years in the future. Benefits of the
   two restoration scenarios, however, constrained the future risk of
   extirpation to a moderate probability. Our results suggest that
   expansive and sustained habitat restoration can maintain desired
   conditions and reduce future extirpation risk for sage grouse on FS-BLM
   lands in western North America. The continued spread of exotic plants,
   however, presents a formidable challenge to successful restoration and
   warrants substantial research and management attention.}},

Abstract = {{1. Analysis of population trajectories is central to assessing risk in
   populations of conservation concern. In animal studies, researchers
   realize that probabilities of detection of individuals are often less
   than one. Plants can also escape detection due to dormancy, herbivory,
   or observer error, but such information is rarely incorporated into
   population studies.
   2. We monitored a population of Asclepias meadii, a rare long-lived
   prairie perennial. Despite standardized methods, numbers of observed
   plants fluctuated greatly from 1992 to 2006. Individual plants often had
   periods of 1-5 years between initial and final sighting when no stems
   were found. To determine the actual population trajectories, we
   estimated rates of survival and population growth using mark-recapture
   models. We also estimated initial and resighting probabilities of
   detection. In 2007, we repeated surveys to identify reasons for low
   detection probabilities.
   3. We estimated 95\% annual survival and a population growth rate of
   1.023. Probabilities of initial detection were low (typically from 0.120
   to 0.311 depending on prairie burn treatment), whereas average
   probability of detection for marked plants was 0.728.
   4. Comparisons of survival estimates from 15-and 8-year data sets
   revealed that survival estimates decline in the final years of a
   multi-year period, probably due to heterogeneity in encounter histories.
   5. By conducting three different surveys in 2007, we found that both
   herbivory over a multiple-week period and observer error contributed
   substantially to gaps in detection.
   6. Synthesis. Probabilities of detection that are less than one
   complicate interpretation of population dynamics, whether of mobile
   animals or inconspicuous plants. Our work illustrates three general
   points that could apply to many plant population studies: (i)
   mark-recapture models may provide insights on vital rates and population
   trajectories despite the extreme variability in count data that can
   arise because of low detectability, (ii) probabilities of initial
   detection can be quantified and can be considerably less than
   probabilities of resighting, and (iii) repeated surveys can help
   researchers determine the degree to which dormancy, herbivory, or
   observer error contribute to low probabilities of detection.
   Consideration of these points can improve the design and analysis of
   monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting the disappearance of active leks is the most efficient way to
   determine large declines in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus
   urophasianus) populations; thus, understanding factors that influence
   lek abandonment is critical. We evaluated factors that may have
   influenced the probability of sage-grouse lek abandonment in the Bighorn
   Basin (BHB) of north-central Wyoming from 1980 to 2009. Our objective
   was to examine lek abandonment based on landscape characteristics that
   explain differences between occupied and unoccupied leks. We evaluated
   lek abandonment from 144 occupied and 39 unoccupied leks from the
   Wyoming Game and Fish Department lek database with sufficient data for
   our 30-year analysis. We conducted our analysis with binary logistic
   regression using landscape predictor variables obtained from geographic
   coverages at 5 scales (1.0-, 3.2-, 4.0-, 5.0-, and 6.4-km radii around
   leks) to evaluate how these disturbances have influenced lek
   abandonment. Coverages included anthropogenic characteristics such as
   agricultural development, oil and gas development, prescribed burned
   treatments, and roads; and environmental characteristics such as
   vegetation attributes and wildfire. Our combined model included the
   number of oil and gas wells in a 1.0-km radius, percent area of wildfire
   in a 1.0-km radius, and variability in shrub height in a 1.0-km radius
   around sage-grouse leks. Abandoned (unoccupied) leks had 1.1-times the
   variability of shrub height in a 1.0-km radius, 3.1-times the percentage
   of wildfire in a 1.0-km radius, and 10.3-times the number of oil and gas
   wells in a 1.0-km radius compared to occupied leks. The model-averaged
   odds of lek persistence with every 1 unit increase in oil and gas wells
   within a 1.0-km radius was 0.66 (90\% CI: 0.370.94), odds with every 1\%
   increase in wildfire in a 1.0-km radius was 0.99 (90\% CI: 0.851.12),
   and odds with every 1 unit increase in the standard deviation of shrub
   height within a 1.0-km radius around a lek was 0.77 (90\% CI: 0.451.08).
   Because the 90\% confidence intervals around the odds ratios of wells
   did not overlap 1.0, we suggest this predictor variable was most
   influential in our model-averaged estimates. The BHB has lower developed
   reserves of oil and gas than many other regions; however, our study
   supports findings from other studies that demonstrate energy development
   increases lek abandonment. Our findings indicate conservation efforts
   should be focused on minimizing well development and implementing
   wildfire suppression tactics near active sage-grouse leks. (c) 2012 The

Abstract = {{We examined the association of temporal and spatial factors with nest
   survival of Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana) nesting in tree cavities
   in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests along the east slope of the
   Cascade Mountains, Washington. All study areas were managed for timber
   production through planned harvests or postfire salvage logging.
   Bluebirds laid a mean clutch of 5.3 +/- 0.1 (SE) eggs (n = 131), and
   successful nests fledged an average of 4.5 +/- 0.2 young (n = 85). Using
   a model-selection framework, we found that nest survival was a function
   of clutch size and treatment and that there was a quadratic effect of
   nest age. Daily survival rates decreased after the onset of incubation,
   then increased through the nestling period, and were higher for clutches
   with >= 5 eggs and in stands that were burned and salvaged. Survivorship
   over the entire period for clutches (n = 131 nests) with <= 4, 5, and >=
   6 eggs was 0.39 (95\% CI: 0.11, 0.65), 0.61 (95\% CI: 0.34, 0.80), and
   0.71 (95\% CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively. Vegetation variables
   associated with nest sites did not significantly affect nest survival.
   Predation accounted for the most nest failures (34\% of nests). We
   suggest that parental defense of nests accounts for the quadratic effect
   of nest age, with adult bluebirds defending nests more aggressively as
   nestlings approach fledging, and that bluebirds laying larger clutches
   are older, more experienced birds, resulting in greater nest survival.}},

Abstract = {{Because of fire suppression and improper land management, native eastern
   redcedar, Juniperus virginiana L., is invading many grassland areas.
   Among these areas are the Loess Canyons of southeastern Lincoln County,
   NE, which support a large population of the federally endangered
   American burying beetle, Nicrophorus americanus Olivier. In the past 30
   yr, cedar encroachment has covered > 30\% of this landscape and is
   increasing at a rate of 2\% per year. The effects of cedar trees on
   remaining populations of American burying beetle are currently unknown.
   In this study, we sampled two sites in Lincoln County, NE, by placing
   paired baited pitfall traps (N = 16) in cedar-dominated and open
   grassland habitats during June and August 2004 and 2005. We collected
   significantly more Silphidae, including American burying beetle in open
   habitats. All American burying beetle were marked and released. The
   recapture rate of these beetles was two times higher in cedar sites than
   in open sites. Among the Silphidae, only Nicrophorus orbicollis Say was
   collected significantly more often in cedar areas. The results of this
   study indicate that cedars reduce numbers of most silphid species,
   likely by limiting their ability to forage for carrion, a required
   resource for feeding and reproduction. This is the first study to
   directly examine the impact of cedar on Silphidae, and our results have
   important implications in the Great Plains and beyond. However, future
   studies must examine the impacts of cedar management, including
   mechanical control or prescribed fire, on American burying beetle and
   other silphid species.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Through pyric herbivory (i.e., fire-induced grazing patterns), native
   grasslands were historically a spatially heterogeneous environment. It
   is hypothesized that the mosaic of habitats created by pyric herbivory
   supports a more diverse invertebrate community compared to modern range
   management. Patch-burn management, a pyric herbivory technique, is an
   application of prescribed fire and grazing whereby the timing and
   location of the burned and grazed patches is varied, creating a
   diversity of habitat conditions. Although disturbance in sandsage
   (Artemisia filifolium Torr.) prairie historically included fire and
   grazing, fire disturbance has been nearly eradicated from this ecosystem
   in western Oklahoma. We compared patch-burn management to traditional
   management (i.e., moderate grazing with no fire) in sandsage prairie to
   evaluate the impact of these two management regimes on aboveground
   invertebrates. We sampled invertebrates at 44 points in each of 3 mo
   (May, June, and July) with the use of Dietrick vacuum sampling.
   Diversity, total abundance, and abundance of seven invertebrate orders
   (Araneae, Diptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and
   Orthoptera) were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures.
   When examined on a patch level, five invertebrate orders were also
   similar between their respective time since burn patch and the
   traditional patches. Araneae and Coleoptera abundance were higher in
   traditional patches, and Hemiptera abundance was higher in current-year
   burn patches. Our results suggest a heterogeneity-based management
   scheme based on pyric herbivory does not negatively impact the overall
   invertebrate community and may benefit a wider variety of invertebrates
   by providing areas of varying levels of disturbance. In comparison,
   homogeneous landscapes such as those created by traditional management
   may only benefit segments of the invertebrate community that have
   habitat associations with moderately disturbed or undisturbed areas.
   Therefore, a disturbance regime involving the interaction of fire and
   grazing may be valuable for maintaining biodiversity and productivity
   within sandsage prairie ecosystems.}},

   for all seven vegetation types combined, the CL is exceeded by at least
   10 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), and in 27\% of the exceedance areas the CL is
   exceeded by at least 5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Management strategies for
   mitigating the effects of excess N are based on reducing N emissions and
   reducing site N capital through approaches such as biomass removal and
   prescribed fire or control of invasive grasses by mowing, selective
   herbicides, weeding or domestic animal grazing. Ultimately, decreases in
   N deposition are needed for long-term ecosystem protection and
   sustainability, and this is the only strategy that will protect

Abstract = {{The butterfly Speyeria idalia was once a widespread species in the
   midwestern United States, but declined precipitously during the 1980s.
   By the early 1990s in NW Indiana and adjacent NE Illinois, it was
   reduced to a single site where it persisted as a precarious three deme
   metapopulation managed using prescribed fire. In 1996, a large-scale
   high diversity restoration was initiated at the site to restore
   ecological connectivity for grassland and oak barrens communities across
   the site. Among many restoration goals, we included restoring
   connectivity for habitat restricted insect communities across the highly
   fragmented site. In support of that goal, we included over 620 local
   genotype plant species in the restoration. S. idalia responded
   positively to the restoration and was the most abundant butterfly across
   the site in 2014. Ironically, we incorrectly considered the primary
   hostplant at the site, Viola bicolor, to be non-native when we initiated
   the restoration and did not include it in our seed mixes. This weedy
   annual aggressively expanded into the restoration without our
   assistance. We believe that we transformed the precarious metapopulation
   into a well-connected patchy population across the restoration. In
   addition, the butterfly occupied previously unoccupied habitats far
   beyond the restoration. This suggests that we have created a regional
   mainland-island metapopulation structure, with the restoration serving
   as a source of immigrants that sustains colonization rates at or above
   the rate of local deme extinction across a landscape that currently
   spans almost 60 km.}},

   threatened or impacted by significant bushfires in January 2014 were
   interviewed. The majority had a low level of concern for bushfire
   threat, with almost all opting to `stay and defend' their property. Few
   had formally written `bushfire risk management plans', adequate
   insurance for livestock, a contingency plan, or used information
   resources. However, they reported multiple other routine and ordinary

Abstract = {{Large tracts of land across the western United States have been managed
   over the last century in an effort to increase forage production, reduce
   the risk of wildland fires, and/or restore ecosystem structure and
   function. Yet documentation of this land-treatment history is lacking.
   With the use of data collected from Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
   field offices across the Colorado Plateau, we quantified the number,
   spatial extent, and implementation cost of tree-reduction and seeding
   treatments done in pinon (Pinus edulis)-juniper (Juniperus osteosperma,
   Juniperus monophylla, Juniperus scopulorum) woodlands between 1950 and
   2003. Over 247000 hectares of land were treated, corresponding to 6.6\%
   of the pinon-juniper vegetation type within BLM-owned lands.
   Tree-reduction treatments involving chaining, bulldozing, or cabling
   were most prevalent between the 1950s and 1970s, with over 163000 ha of
   land treated with these methods. Prescribed burning became increasingly
   prevalent in the 1980s, with over 43000 ha burned. In more recent years,
   hydroaxe treatments have become common (4 400 ha treated), but to a much
   lesser extent than prescribed burns. Over 60\% of these tree-reduction
   treatments were done in conjunction with revegetation or seeding
   treatments. Implementation costs of these tree-reduction treatments were
   over \$26.7 million, with the hydroaxe treatment having nearly three
   times the cost of implementation than all other tree-reduction
   treatments. The spatial extent of these tree-reduction treatments and
   associated implementation costs highlight the importance of research
   examining the efficacy of these treatments and the potential legacy
   effects. The land-use history reported in this study and the
   accompanying freely accessible on-line database is a useful tool to
   guide research and management objectives and methodology.}},

Abstract = {{t The Cueva del Angel (Lucena, Spain) is an open-air archaeological site
   with a sedimentary sequence remnant of a collapsed rock shelter which
   was part of a still active karst complex. The lithic assemblage consists
   essentially of abundant retouched tools including 46 identified handaxes
   along with non-modified flakes, and is associated with faunal remains
   dominated by Equus fetus and other large bovids and cervids. A large
   proportion of bones has undergone intense anthropic actions and been
   subjected to intense fire, thus evidencing sustained use of animal meat
   resources by humans.
   In order to better ascertain the chronological framework of the site, we
   dated several proxies. Various speleothem samples were processed by
   U-series using a coupled induced plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS-MC).
   The resulting isotopic ratios are beyond the secular equilibrium and
   show that these samples do not appear to be in direct stratigraphic
   relation with the archaeological sequence.
   Nine Equus teeth were analyzed by the combined ESR/U-series method.
   These samples were taken from Unit I to Unit XVI representing at least
   2.5 m of stratigraphic depth and approximately 90\% of the inning. Many
   of the dated samples are burnt given that more than 85\% of the faunal
   remains exhibit traces of fire exposure.
   The bone retouchers, for which a comparative analysis with other sites
   has been published (Moigne et al., 2016), were probably produced during
   the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 11-5) chronological interval corresponding
   to the later part of the Middle Pleistocene, inference that is in
   agreement with the palaeontological assemblage of the site. The
   radiometric results presented here are consistent and indicate a range
   from 350 to 183 ka, suggesting that a major part of the sedimentary
   inning coinciding with the human occupation was contemporaneous with the
   MIS 9 to 7 time period.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive outbreaks of bark beetles have affected not only large parts
   of coniferous forests in the Northern Hemisphere, but also - largely
   absent from global attention - native pine forests of Central America.
   As such outbreaks frequently spark management debates among residents,
   land managers, forest owners and the public, the social acceptance of
   bark beetle control measures has become crucial for modern land
   management. However, the sociological and psychological determinants of
   the preference for specific bark beetle control measures outside
   protected areas remain unclear. To determine the acceptability of bark
   beetle control measures in El Salvador, we assessed how demographic
   variables, attitude towards the bark beetle, education, and
   self-reported knowledge affected the preference for different bark
   beetle control measures in a survey of government employees and local
   forest owners using a quantitative questionnaire survey. Cumulative link
   mixed models revealed that the general preference for control measures
   increased with increasing self-reported knowledge about the bark beetle
   but decreased with increasing level of respondent education and an
   increasing positive attitude towards the bark beetle. Respondents
   generally preferred beetle control measures on small areas than on large
   areas. Preferences for control measures did not differ between
   government employees and forest owners, with controlled burning and
   chemical control significantly less accepted than stand thinning or
   salvage logging. We discuss the most preferred control measures
   considering recent scientific evidence of their efficacy and conclude
   that the current bark beetle outbreak should be controlled through
   logging of pines weakened by fire in the short-term and by stand
   thinning in the medium-term to prevent further outbreaks.}},

   catchments. Macroinvertebrate sampling conducted 8 years after the

Abstract = {{Solitary bees are known to be important pollinators of seasonal dry
   forest plants in Costa Rica. Recent assessments of the genus Centris
   (family Anthophoridae) and other solitary bee taxa indicate that
   populations of these bees have declined by 85-90 percent in this forest
   over the past 20 yr. Deforestation, wildfires, and conversion of forest
   land to agriculture are the main reasons for the decline.
   From 1987 to 1991 we studied the preferred nesting habitats of seven
   Centris species that specialize in making their nests in preexisting
   holes in dead trees. Special wooden sampling units, with preexisting
   standardized holes, were systematically placed in several habitat types
   in the Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Guanacaste Province. Female
   bees encountered the holes as they searched for natural holes for
   nesting. Systematic monitoring of the units over five years, 1987 to
   1991, provided a quantitative measure of habitat preference and changes
   in bee frequency through time. There were sufficient data for
   statistical analysis of three of the seven species (Centris nitida, C.
   bicornuta and C. analis).
   The dosed oak forest was the predominantly preferred habitat for the
   three common Centris species, and this pattern remained constant through
   time. At least one species (C nitida) apparently had less strict habitat
   requirements as it was commonly found nesting in a wide variety of
   habitat types. Significant increases and decreases in frequencies for
   individual species through time were recorded; however, there was no
   significant change in overall bee numbers through time.
   Results of the analysis, together with a qualitative assessment of the
   rare Centris species, suggest that the dry forest is actually a mosaic
   of preferred nesting sites, with each species having specific
   preferences. This pattern is consistent with other Centris species that
   have been studied in Costa Rica. The preference for oak forests is
   significant and suggests that more of this type of habitat should be
   conserved for Centris refugia.}},

Title = {{Modeling wood dynamics, jam formation, and sediment storage in a
   gravel-bed stream}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{In small and intermediate sized streams, the interaction between wood
   and bed material transport often determines the nature of the physical
   habitat, which in turn influences the health of the stream's ecosystem.
   We present a stochastic model that can be used to simulate the effects
   on physical habitat of forest fires, climate change, and other
   environmental disturbances that alter wood recruitment. The model
   predicts large wood (LW) loads in a stream as well as the volume of
   sediment stored by the wood; while it is parameterized to describe
   gravel bed streams similar to a well-studied field prototype, Fishtrap
   Creek, British Columbia, it can be calibrated to other systems as well.
   In the model, LW pieces are produced and modified over time as a result
   of random tree-fall, LW breakage, LW movement, and piece interaction to
   form LW jams. Each LW piece traps a portion of the annual bed material
   transport entering the reach and releases the stored sediment when the
   LW piece is entrained and moved. The equations governing sediment
   storage are based on a set of flume experiments also scaled to the field
   prototype. The model predicts wood loads ranging from 70 m(3)/ha to more
   than 300 m(3)/ha, with a mean value of 178 m(3)/ha: both the range and
   the mean value are consistent with field data from streams with similar
   riparian forest types and climate. The model also predicts an LW jam
   spacing that is consistent with field data. Furthermore, our modeling
   results demonstrate that the high spatial and temporal variability in
   sediment storage, sediment transport, and channel morphology associated
   with LW-dominated streams occurs only when LW pieces interact and form
   jams. Model runs that do not include jam formation are much less
   variable. These results suggest that river restoration efforts using
   engineered LW pieces that are fixed in place and not permitted to
   interact will be less successful at restoring the geomorphic processes
   responsible for producing diverse, productive physical habitats than
   efforts using LW pieces that are free to move, interact, and form LW
   jams.}},

Title = {{Land Cover Change in Northern Botswana: The Influence of Climate, Fire,
   and Elephants on Semi-Arid Savanna Woodlands}},
Journal = {{LAND}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Complex couplings and feedback among climate, fire, and herbivory drive
   short- and long-term patterns of land cover change (LCC) in savanna
   ecosystems. However, understanding of spatial and temporal LCC patterns
   in these environments is limited, particularly for semi-arid regions
   transitional between arid and more mesic climates. Here, we use
   post-classification analysis of Landsat TM (1990), ETM+ (2003), and OLI
   (2013) satellite imagery to classify and assess net and gross LCC for
   the Chobe District, a 21,000 km(2) area encompassing urban, peri-urban,
   rural, communally-managed (Chobe Enclave), and protected land (Chobe
   National Park, CNP, and six protected forest reserves). We then evaluate
   spatiotemporal patterns of LCC in relation to precipitation, fire
   detections (MCD14M, 2001-2013) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and dry season elephant (Loxodonta africana)
   aerial survey data (2003, 2006, 2012, 2013). Woodland cover declined
   over the study period by 1514 km(2) (16.2\% of initial class total),
   accompanied by expansion of shrubland (1305 km(2), 15.7\%) and grassland
   (265 km(2), 20.3\%). Net LCC differed importantly in protected areas,
   with higher woodland losses observed in forest reserves compared to the
   CNP. Loss of woodland was also higher in communally-managed land for the
   study period, despite gains from 2003-2013. Gross (class) changes were
   characterized by extensive exchange between woodland and shrubland
   during both time steps, and a large expansion of shrubland into
   grassland and bare ground from 2003-2013. MODIS active fire detections
   were highly variable from year to year and among the different protected
   areas, ranging from 1.8 fires{*}year(-1)/km(2) in the Chobe Forest
   Reserve to 7.1 fires{*}year(-1)/km(2) in the Kasane Forest Reserve
   Extension. Clustering and timing of dry season fires suggests that
   ignitions were predominately from anthropogenic sources. Annual fire
   count was significantly related to total annual rainfall (p = 0.009,
   adj. R-2 = 0.50), with a 41\% increase in average fire occurrence in
   years when rainfall exceeded long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP).
   Loss of woodland was significantly associated with fire in locations
   experiencing 15 or more ignitions during the period 2001-2013 (p =
   0.024). Although elephant-mediated damage is often cited as a major
   cause of woodland degradation in northern Botswana, we observed little
   evidence of unsustainable pressure on woodlands from growing elephant
   populations. Our data indicate broad-scale LCC processes in semi-arid
   savannas in Southern Africa are strongly coupled to environmental and
   anthropogenic forcings. Increased seasonal variability is likely to have
   important effects on the distribution of savanna plant communities due
   to climate-fire feedbacks. Long-term monitoring of LCC in these

Abstract = {{The thinning of stream buffer zones (SBZs) is gaining popularity as a
   silvicultural management practice in order to reduce the risk of
   wildfire and insect hazard, provide economic return, and improve the
   effectiveness of SBZs. In this study, streamflow over a 1-year period
   was monitored at 2 small paired watersheds (treated vs. reference). The
   short-term impacts of a partial cutting within a SBZ as well as the
   relative effects of pastoral, forested, and clearcut areas on changes in
   downstream hydrology were examined. Upstream pastoral areas had a higher
   water yield than downstream forested sections during the no-harvest
   (calibration) period of 6 months. The partial cut (about 50\% of the
   basal area) within the SBZ changed the hydrologic pattern by remarkably
   increasing the water yield on the treated downstream sections during the
   6-month-long postharvest period. The harvest operation also caused an
   increase in direct runoff at 2 downstream sections, WT2 and WT3 (similar
   to 200\% and similar to 100\%, respectively). No significant changes
   were observed in the water yield pattern of the control watershed.
   Because harvested areas within the SBZs constitute a fraction of the
   monitored sub-watersheds and only partial harvesting (similar to 50\% of
   the basal area) was implemented, the observed increase in flow at the
   treated downstream sections (100\% and 250\%, respectively) is
   unprecedented. The partial harvesting within the SBZs also resulted in a
   significantly flashier hydrological system. Because silvicultural
   treatments are part of regular, repeated management operations, these
   short term (in this study, 6-month-long) but substantial changes in
   water yield, direct runoff, and flashiness could have important
   implications for water quality, water resources, and downstream biota.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the effects of natural and anthropogenic watershed

   from boreal Shield lakes. MeHg in zooplankton was monitored for three
   years in nine lakes impacted by deforestation, in nine lakes impacted by

   sampled during spring, mid- and late summer. MeHg in zooplankton showed
   a seasonal trend: concentrations were the lowest in spring, then peaked
   in mid-summer and decreased in late summer. Over the three study years,
   MeHg concentrations observed in mid-summer in zooplankton from forest
   harvested lakes were significantly higher than in reference and
   fire-impacted lakes, whereas differences between these two groups of
   lakes were not significant. The pattern of distribution of MeHg in
   zooplankton during the different seasons paralleled that of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), which is known as a vector of Hg from watershed
   soils to lake water. Besides DOC, MeHg in zooplankton also showed a
   positive significant correlation with epilimnetic temperature and
   sulfate concentrations. An inter-annual decreasing trend in MeHg was
   observed in zooplankton from reference and fire-impacted lakes. In
   forest harvested lakes, however, MeHg concentrations remained higher and
   nearly constant over three years following the impact. Overall these
   results indicate that the MeHg pulse observed in zooplankton following
   deforestation by harvesting is relatively long-lived, and may have
   repercussions to the accumulation of MeHg along the food chain.
   Therefore, potential effects of deforestation on the Hg contamination of

Abstract = {{This paper, the final in a series of ten papers that report the impact
   of silvicultural treatments (harvesting and associated burning) in
   jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest, reviews these papers and explores
   similarities and disparities. More than 2500 species were processed,
   dominated by macro-invertebrates, vascular flora and macrofungi. Few
   significant impacts were evident, and most species groups were resilient
   to the disturbances imposed. Regeneration stocking did not meet
   specified standards on two gap release and seven shelterwood grids
   subjected to silvicultural treatment in the period 1988-2002. Six
   treated grids had a retained basal area of more than 18 m(2) ha(-1),
   which obviated the need for further regeneration. More than 50 y may be
   needed for biological processes to reverse the increase in bulk density
   of soil caused during harvesting. Cryptogams (especially lichens) were
   the species group most sensitive to disturbance, although recovery of
   species richness was nearly complete 10 y after disturbance. For
   cryptogams and vascular flora, species recorded in only one grid
   (singletons) were more likely to occur on reference grids than on
   silviculturally treated grids. For all species groups studied, the
   imprint of harvesting 40 or more years earlier on species composition
   had become indistinguishable from that on grids never harvested. Soil
   nutrient status correlated with species rich-ness for fungi on wood
   (negatively), light-trapped inverte-brates (positively), birds
   (positively) and terrestrial vertebrates (frogs, reptiles and mammals,
   negatively). Silvicultural disturbance (timber harvesting and associated
   burning) correlated with species richness for fungi on wood
   (positively), terrestrial vertebrates (positively) and cryptogams
   (negatively). Time since the last (prescribed) fire did not correlate
   with any species group. Plant disease decreased species richness of
   light-trapped invertebrates by about 35\%. Very few taxa were
   sufficiently widespread or sufficiently responsive to silvicultural
   disturbance to be of value as bio-indicators, demonstrating the
   superiority of biodiversity monitoring over bio-indicator monitoring. It
   is recommended that FORESTCHECK be expanded into a biological survey of
   the lower south-west of Western Australia.}},

   conducted at the valuable habitats or in the vicinity of them on long

Abstract = {{1. Habitat disturbance and species invasions interact in natural
   systems, making it difficult to isolate the primary cause of ecosystem
   degradation. A general understanding requires case studies of how
   disturbance and invasion interact across a variety of ecosystem invasive
   species combinations. 2. Dramatic losses in ant diversity followed the
   invasion of central Texas by red imported fire ants (Solenopsis
   invicta). However, recent manipulative studies in Florida revealed no
   effect on ant diversity following the removal of S. invicta from a
   disturbed pasture habitat, but moderate loss of diversity associated
   with their introduction into undisturbed habitat and no invasion
   occurred without disturbance. Thus, the importance of S. invicta in
   driving diversity loss and its ability to invade undisturbed systems is
   unresolved. 3. We examine the distribution and abundance of a large
   monogyne S. invicta population and its association with the co-occurring
   ant assemblage at a site in south Texas close to the aridity tolerance
   limit of S. invicta. 4. We document that moisture modulates S. invicta
   densities. Further, soil disturbing habitat manipulations greatly
   increase S. invicta population densities. However, S. invicta penetrates
   all habitats regardless of soil disturbance history. In contrast,
   controlled burns depress S. invicta densities. 5. In habitats where S.
   invicta is prevalent, it completely replaces native fire ants. However,
   S. invicta impacts native ants as a whole less strongly. Intriguingly,
   native ants responded distinctly to S. invicta in different
   environments. In wet, undisturbed environments, high S. invicta
   abundance disrupts the spatial structure of the ant assemblage by
   increasing clumping and is associated with reduced species density,
   while in dry-disturbed habitats, sites with high S. invicta abundance
   possess high numbers of native species. Analyses of co-occurrence
   indicate that reduced species density in wet-undisturbed sites arises
   from negative species interactions between native ants and S. invicta.
   However, these same data suggest that the high native species density of
   abundant S. invicta sites in dry-disturbed environments does not result
   from facilitation. 6. Monogyne S. invicta populations play different
   roles in different environments, driving ant diversity loss in some, but
   being largely symptomatic of habitat disturbance in others.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional shifting cultivation is a long-standing practice that has
   contributed to self-sufficiency and self-supply in the lives of
   mountainous ethnic minorities in the long history. However, it is the
   direct cause of deforestation; Uncontrolled burning of vegetation is
   also a major cause of forest fires. At present, Vietnam has about 50
   ethnic groups making shifting cultivation. Each ethnic group has its own
   characteristics in shifting cultivation, which reflects their
   perceptions, experiences, traditions and religious beliefs. The cycle of
   cultivation takes place at various stages and follows a very strict
   cultivation schedule: the main stages of the shifting cultivation cycle
   are: (i) site selection (in principle, generally select old forests,
   good soil, few bushes, vines, (iii) clear, (iv) prune(v) care, weed (vi)
   harvest (vii) abandon. Therefore, the best approach to improving and
   preserving soil quality is through the use of ecological agricultural
   practices: reuse of residues of crops and animal derived organic
   fertilizers, reduced use of chemicals in agriculture, promotion of cover
   crops, especially legumes, to protect and rehabilitate land. Care should
   be taken to develop techniques for maximizing biomass, ground cover and
   continuity of the cover to prevent soil erosion, enhance biological
   activity, enhance reproductive nutrition, create basic soil properties
   such as soil texture, organic content, porosity, pH, etc. All these
   efforts are aimed at creating the best conditions for the growth and
   development of the crops. Studies show that management of shifting
   cultivation towards an agro-ecology approach is indispensable in the
   sustainable management and use of sloping land. This in fact has
   significantly increased yields on sloping crops, reduced erosion and
   income diversification for farmers while preserving resources and
   improving the environment, contributing to hunger elimination and
   poverty reduction and achievement of food security goals for the
   mountainous areas.}},

   rates of runoff and channel alteration, have the greatest impacts on
   macroinvertebrate community metrics and foodweb responses. Postfire
   effects are variable in time and space, but in smaller size streams
   (first to fourth order) that are otherwise undisturbed, changes
   generally are restricted to the first 5-10 years following fire and are
   associated with the more intense bums (crown fires with greater than or
   equal to50\% of the catchment involved). In unfragmented habitats,
   initially supporting intact, functioning stream ecosystems, recovery
   from fire appears to be relatively rapid and to contribute to enhanced
   aquatic productivity and biodiversity. However, in poorly managed
   watersheds and those subjected to indiscriminate salvage logging,
   impacts from fire are expected to be greater and recovery of the
   macroinvertebrate communities and stream ecosystems more protracted. (C)

Abstract = {{The whitespotted sawyer, Monochamus scutellatus scutellatus (Say)
   (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), is one of the most damaging wood-boring
   insects in recently burned boreal forests of North America. In Canada,
   salvage logging after wildfire contributes to maintaining the timber
   volume required by the forest industry, but larvae of this insect cause
   significant damage that reduces the economic value of lumber products.
   This study aimed to estimate damage progression as a function of
   temperature in recently burned black spruce (Picea mariana (Miller)
   Britton, Sterns, and Poggenburg) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lambert)
   trees. Using axial tomographic technology, we modeled subcortical
   development and gallery depth progression rates as functions of
   temperature for both tree species. Generally, these rates were slightly
   faster in black spruce than in jack pine logs. Eggs laid on logs kept at
   12 degrees C did not hatch or larvae were unable to establish themselves
   under the bark because no larval development was observed. At 16 degrees
   C, larvae stayed under the bark for >200 d before penetrating into the
   sapwood. At 20 degrees C, half of the larvae entered the sapwood after
   30-50 d, but gallery depth progression stopped for approximate to 70 d,
   suggesting that larvae went into diapause. The other half of the larvae
   entered the sapwood only after 100-200 d. At 24 and 28 degrees C, larvae
   entered the sapwood after 26-27 and 21 d, respectively. At 28 degrees C,
   gallery depth progressed at a rate of 1.44 mm/d. Temperature threshold
   for subcortical development was slightly lower in black spruce (12.9
   degrees C) than in jack pine (14.6 degrees C) and it was 1 degrees C
   warmer for gallery depth progression for both tree species. These
   results indicate that significant damage may occur within a few months

Abstract = {{Global biodiversity hotspots are rich in endemic insect species, many of
   which are threatened by the ongoing anthropogenic pressures on their
   habitats. The Cape region (South Africa) is one of these biodiversity
   hotspots, maintaining a high number of endemics. However, the ecology of
   most insect species in this region remains poorly understood. The two
   Orthoptera species Betiscoides meridionalis and Betiscoides parva are
   endemic to the Cape region and specialized on restio vegetation. They
   are threatened by increasing wildfire frequencies and invasions of
   non-native plant species. However, this information has been inferred
   from habitat changes, whereas no ecological study on these species has
   been conducted since they have been described. In order to facilitate
   conservation management, information on the ecology of these species is
   urgently required. The aim of our study was (1) to obtain data on the
   population ecology (particularly population sizes and mobility), and (2)
   to study the behavior of both species in response to environmental
   factors. For this purpose a mark-recapture-study and an observational
   behavior study were conducted. Both species had small population sizes
   and a low mobility with males moving greater distances than females.
   Wind had a strong influence on the behavior of Betiscoides, particularly
   on the small males of B. parva. Future studies might thus focus on the
   question whether wind-exposure is a critical factor for habitat choice
   of this species. We strongly recommend enhancing the connectivity of
   restio habitats and restoring these habitats to prevent extinction of
   specialized insect species.}},

Abstract = {{Arid and semi-arid grasslands of southwestern North America have changed
   dramatically over the last 150 years as a result of shrub encroachment,
   i.e. the increase in density, cover and biomass of indigenous shrubby
   plants in grasslands. Numerous studies have documented the expansion of
   shrublands in the southwestern American grasslands; in particular shrub
   encroachment has occurred strongly in part of the northern Chihuahuan
   desert since 1860. This encroachment has been simulated using an
   ecohydrological Cellular Automata model, CATGraSS. It is a spatially
   distributed model driven by spatially explicit irradiance and runs on a
   fine-resolution gridded domain. Plant competition is modelled by keeping
   track of mortality and establishment of plants; both are calculated
   probabilistically based on soil moisture stress. For this study CATGraSS
   has been improved with a stochastic fire module and a grazing function.
   The model has been implemented in a small area in Sevilleta National
   Wildlife Refuge (SNWR), characterized by two vegetation types (grass
   savanna and creosote bush shrub), considering as encroachment causes the
   fire return period increase, the grazing increase, the seed dispersal
   caused by animals, the role of wind direction and plant type
   competition. The model is able to reproduce the encroachment that has
   occurred in SNWR, simulating an increase of the shrub from 2\% in 1860
   to the current shrub percentage, 42\%, and highlighting among the most
   influential factors the reduced fire frequency and the increased grazing
   intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change continues to threaten forests and their ecosystem
   services while substantially altering natural disturbance regimes. Land
   cover changes and consequent management entail discrepancies in carbon
   sequestration provided by forest ecosystems and its accounting.
   Currently there is a lack of sufficient and harmonized data for Ukraine
   that can be used for the robust and spatially explicit assessment of
   forest provisioning and regulation of ecosystem services. In the frame
   of this research, we established an experimental polygon (area 45 km(2))
   in Northern Ukraine aiming at estimating main forest carbon stocks and
   fluxes and determining the impact caused by natural disturbances and
   harvest for the study period of 2010-2015. Coupled field inventory and
   remote sensing data (RapidEye image for 2010 and SPOT 6 image for 2015)
   were used. Land cover classification and estimation of biomass and
   carbon pools were carried out using Random Forest and k-Nearest
   Neighbors (k-NN) method, respectively. Remote sensing data indicates a
   ca. 16\% increase of carbon stock, while ground-based computations have
   shown only a ca. 1\% increase. Net carbon fluxes for the study period
   are relatively even: 5.4 Gg Cyear(-1) and 5.6 Gg C Cyear(-1) for field
   and remote sensing data, respectively. Stand-replacing wildfires, as
   well as insect outbreaks and wind damage followed by salvage logging,
   and timber harvest have caused 21\% of carbon emissions among all C
   sources within the experimental polygon during the study period. Hence,
   remote sensing data and non-parametric methods coupled with field data
   can serve as reliable tools for the precise estimation of forest carbon
   cycles on a regional spatial scale. However, featured land cover changes
   lead to unexpected biases in consistent assessment of forest biophysical
   parameters, while current management practices neglect natural forest
   dynamics and amplify negative impact of disturbances on ecosystem
   services.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{465-474}},
Abstract = {{Understanding space-use patterns of highly mobile animals, such as
   woodland caribou, is required for ecosystem conservation. We tested for
   seasonal differences in migration habitat used by woodland caribou white
   travelling from winter to summer and summer to winter range in northwest
   Ontario, using radio-telemetry locations of 33 caribou collected from
   1995 to 2000. Forest management guidelines in Ontario presume that
   woodland caribou select specific habitats during the migrating seasons
   including conifer dominated forests and waterways (rivers and takes).
   Results showed few differences between real travel routes and
   straight-line routes during both high movement periods (post-calving to
   late winter and late winter to calving). Caribou selected less deciduous
   forest than available during early winter and spring but contrary to
   expectations they did not use more open areas and waterways than
   available. Possible migration corridors, or habitat used during early
   winter and spring, were not distinguished by one particular habitat
   type, although caribou were more likely to avoid water and open areas,
   while using more conifer forests. They did not avoid disturbed habitat
   such as recently burnt or cut areas. There were some sex-specific
   differences with mates using deciduous forest more than females. Caribou
   did not choose more than expected of waterways such as chains of lakes
   or large rivers which, to some extent, run counter to management
   recommendations. Our findings should be considered when developing local
   forest management plans and designing harvest patterns with the intent
   to mitigate negative impacts on woodland caribou habitat. (C) 2004

Title = {{Nitrous oxide emission from Australian agricultural lands and mitigation
   options: a review}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{165-195}},
Abstract = {{Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide
   (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and halocarbons in the
   atmosphere due to human activities are associated with global climate
   change. The concentration of N2O has increased by 16\% since 1750.
   Although the atmospheric concentration of N2O is much smaller (314 ppb
   in 1998) than of CO2 (365 ppm), its global warming potential (
   cumulative radiative forcing) is 296 times that of the latter in a
   100-year time horizon. Currently, it contributes about 6\% of the
   overall global warming effect but its contribution from the agricultural
   sector is about 16\%. Of that, almost 80\% of N2O is emitted from
   Australian agricultural lands, originating from N fertilisers (32\%),
   soil disturbance (38\%), and animal waste (30\%).
   Nitrous oxide is primarily produced in soil by the activities of
   microorganisms during nitrification, and denitrification processes. The
   ratio of N2O to N-2 production depends on oxygen supply or water-filled
   pore space, decomposable organic carbon, N substrate supply,
   temperature, and pH and salinity. N2O production from soil is sporadic
   both in time and space, and therefore, it is a challenge to scale up the
   measurements of N2O emission from a given location and time to regional
   and national levels.
   Estimates of N2O emissions from various agricultural systems vary
   widely. For example, in flooded rice in the Riverina Plains, N2O
   emissions ranged from 0.02\% to 1.4\% of fertiliser N applied, whereas
   in irrigated sugarcane crops, 15.4\% of fertiliser was lost over a 4-day
   period. Nitrous oxide emissions from fertilised dairy pasture soils in
   Victoria range from 6 to 11 kg N2O-N/ ha, whereas in arable cereal
   cropping, N2O emissions range from < 0.01\% to 9.9\% of N fertiliser
   applications. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil nitrite and nitrates
   resulting from residual fertiliser and legumes are rarely studied but
   probably exceed those from fertilisers, due to frequent wetting and
   drying cycles over a longer period and larger area. In ley cropping
   systems, significant N2O losses could occur, from the accumulation of
   mainly nitrate-N, following mineralisation of organic N from
   legume-based pastures. Extensive grazed pastures and rangelands
   contribute annually about 0.2 kg N/ha as N2O (93 kg/ha per year
   CO2-equivalent). Tropical savannas probably contribute an order of
   magnitude more, including that from frequent fires. Unfertilised
   forestry systems may emit less but the fertilised plantations emit more
   N2O than the extensive grazed pastures. However, currently there are
   limited data to quantify N2O losses in systems under ley cropping,
   tropical savannas, and forestry in Australia. Overall, there is a need
   to examine the emission factors used in estimating national N2O
   emissions; for example, 1.25\% of fertiliser or animal- excreted N
   appearing as N2O (IPCC 1996).
   The primary consideration for mitigating N2O emissions from agricultural
   lands is to match the supply of mineral N ( from fertiliser
   applications, legume-fixed N, organic matter, or manures) to its spatial
   and temporal needs by crops/pastures/trees. Thus, when appropriate,
   mineral N supply should be regulated through slow-release (urease and/or
   nitrification inhibitors, physical coatings, or high C/N ratio
   materials) or split fertiliser application. Also, N use could be
   maximised by balancing other nutrient supplies to plants. Moreover,
   non-legume cover crops could be used to take up residual mineral N
   following N-fertilised main crops or mineral N accumulated following
   legume leys. For manure management, the most effective practice is the
   early application and immediate incorporation of manure into soil to
   reduce direct N2O emissions as well as secondary emissions from
   deposition of ammonia volatilised from manure and urine. Current models
   such as DNDC and DAYCENT can be used to simulate N2O production from
   soil after parameterisation with the local data, and appropriate
   modification and verification against the measured N2O emissions under
   different management practices.
   In summary, improved estimates of N2O emission from agricultural lands
   and mitigation options can be achieved by a directed national research
   program that is of considerable duration, covers sampling season and
   climate, and combines different techniques ( chamber and
   micrometeorological) using high precision analytical instruments and
   simulation modelling, under a range of strategic activities in the
   agriculture sector.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances are fundamental to forest ecosystem dynamics and
   have been used for two decades to improve forest management, notably in
   the boreal forest. Initially based on fire regimes, there is now a need
   to extend the concept to include other types of disturbances as they can
   greatly contribute to forest dynamics in some regions of the boreal
   zone. Here we review the main descriptorsthat is, the severity,
   specificity, spatial and temporal descriptors and legacies, of windthrow
   and spruce bud worm outbreak disturbance regimes in boreal forestsin
   order to facilitate incorporating them into a natural disturbance-based
   forest management framework. We also describe the biological legacies
   that are generated by these disturbances. Temporal and spatial
   descriptors characterising both disturbance types are generally variable
   in time and space. This makes them difficult to reproduce in an
   ecosystem management framework. However, severity and specificity
   descriptors may provide a template upon which policies for maintaining
   post harvesting and salvage logging biological legacies can be based. In
   a context in which management mainly targets mature and old-growth
   stages, integrating insect and wind disturbances in a management
   framework is an important goal, as these disturbances contribute to
   creating heterogeneity in mature and old-growth forest characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of the golden bandicoot (Isoodon auratus) on Marchinbar
   Island off north-eastern Arhemland, Northern Territory, was confirmed by
   means of morphological features, hair characteristics and allozyme
   electrophoresis. Evidence of I. auratus was found at most points sampled
   along the 50-km length of Marchinbar Island. The species showed a strong
   habitat preference for low heath or shrubland on sand or sandstone, a
   combination that covers some 70\% or 140 km(2) of the island. No sign
   was found in the remaining forest/thicket or strand/casuarina habitat.
   No major changes occurred in the distribution of the species between
   seasons, and individuals maintained overlapping home ranges of similar
   size, about 10-35 ha.
   Considerable variation occurred in the characteristics of sites used for
   daytime shelter, including rocky shelves, shrubs and Triodia hummocks.
   Different shelter sites were frequently occupied on consecutive days.
   Foraging sites were sparsely vegetated and diet consisted mainly of a
   broad range of invertebrates. It is likely that the rocky habitat of
   Marchinbar Island is sufficiently dissected to ensure the availability
   of suitable habitat without the necessity of a managed fire regime. The
   bandicoot population on Marchinbar Island has at least two terrestrial
   predators, wild dogs (Canis familiaris) and carpet pythons (Morelia
   spilota). The current predation pressure is not considered to threaten
   the existence of the bandicoots on the island; however, the addition of
   another predator species (e.g. the feral cat) may create unacceptable

Abstract = {{White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus dacotensis Zimm.) numbers in

   July 1993-July 1996, 73 adult and yearling doe and 12 adult and yearling
   buck white-tailed deer were radiocollared and visually monitored.
   Habitat information was collected at 4,662 white-tailed deer locations

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Natural resource management professionals require adaptable spatial
   tools for conserving and managing wildlife across landscapes. These
   tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and
   incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling
   framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional
   resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat
   quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou
   (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used
   to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on
   two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we
   computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using
   different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and
   the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in
   heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance
   led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model
   in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not
   considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall
   representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition,
   connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality
   produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual
   components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through
   additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods,
   areas of very high- and poor-quality habitat were found at consistent
   locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of
   regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions.

Abstract = {{There are many different anthropogenic causes of wetland degradation,
   such as disturbances which affect the physical structure of wetlands,
   resulting in erosion (altered fire regimes, road and railway building
   through wetlands, channelization of wetlands), pollution, land-cover
   change, and climate change. These different types of degradation have
   various impacts, depending on the type of wetland, soils, biochemistry
   and other factors. We researched a poorly-studied South African
   valley-bottom peatland that is dominated by the ecosystem engineer
   Palmiet: Prionium serratum. We ask the question: what is the impact of
   degradation by gully erosion, pollution and alien tree invasion on
   biochemistry and plant community composition of palmiet wetlands? In 39
   plots from three palmiet wetlands situated approximately 200km apart we
   found that channel erosion, through a loss of alluvium, has probably
   resulted in leached soils with lower soil organic matter and water
   content, less able to retain nutrients and cations. Soil leaching is a
   possible explanation for the groundwater of degraded wetlands having
   higher electrical conductivity and pH than that of pristine wetlands and
   a lower soil cation exchange capacity (21.3 +/- 5.80-7.7 +/-
   4.91meq/100g). The loss of alluvium typically resulted in a completely
   new plant community, composed mostly of pioneer species and several
   alien species. The increase in base saturation (17.5 +/- 8.46-30.2 +/-
   17.85\%) and soil pH (4.8 +/- 0.51-5.1 +/- 0.50) with degradation was
   hypothesized to be the result of liming practices. Once extremely
   degraded, i.e. all the alluvium is lost, it is unlikely that these
   sensitive palmiet wetlands will recover original vegetation communities
   and lost functions, except on long timescales. We recommend conservation
   of the few pristine wetlands that remain, and rehabilitation of those
   that still retain some of their original function.}},

   evaluated and compared across the four landscapes. A stochastic
   simulation modeling system, Simulating Vegetative Patterns and Processes
   at Landscape Scales (SIMPPLLE), is initially applied to assess wildfire,
   insect, and disease risks on each landscape without management
   treatments, but with fire suppression. These simulation results, in the
   form of risk ratings for each plant community, are input into the
   Multi-resource Analysis and Geographic Information System (MAGIS). MAGIS
   is an optimization modeling system, for scheduling activities that
   reduce these risks and address other management objectives. The derived
   treatment schedules are used in additional SIMPPLLE simulations to
   examine the impact on wildfire and other disturbance processes
   probability. Fuel treatment effects are quantified as changes in the
   predicted extent and intensity of future wildfires, impacts on other
   resource objectives, and the resulting economic benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Climate-driven increases in wildfires, drought conditions, and insect
   outbreaks are critical threats to forest carbon stores. In particular,
   bark beetles are important disturbance agents although their long-term
   interactions with future climate change are poorly understood. Droughts
   and the associated moisture deficit contribute to the onset of bark
   beetle outbreaks although outbreak extent and severity is dependent upon
   the density of host trees, wildfire, and forest management. Our
   objective was to estimate the effects of climate change and bark beetle
   outbreaks on ecosystem carbon dynamics over the next century in a
   western US forest. Specifically, we hypothesized that (a) bark beetle
   outbreaks under climate change would reduce net ecosystem carbon balance
   (NECB) and increase uncertainty and (b) these effects could be
   ameliorated by fuels management. We also examined the specific tree
   species dynamics-competition and release-that determined NECB response
   to bark beetle outbreaks. Our study area was the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB),
   CA and NV, USA, an area of diverse forest types encompassing steep
   elevation and climatic gradients and representative of mixed-conifer
   forests throughout the western United States. We simulated climate
   change, bark beetles, wildfire, and fuels management using a
   landscape-scale stochastic model of disturbance and succession. We
   simulated the period 2010-2100 using downscaled climate projections.
   Recurring droughts generated conditions conducive to large-scale
   outbreaks; the resulting large and sustained outbreaks significantly
   increased the probability of LTB forests becoming C sources over decadal
   time scales, with slower-than-anticipated landscape-scale recovery. Tree
   species composition was substantially altered with a reduction in
   functional redundancy and productivity. Results indicate heightened
   uncertainty due to the synergistic influences of climate change and
   interacting disturbances. Our results further indicate that current fuel
   management practices will not be effective at reducing landscape-scale
   outbreak mortality. Our results provide critical insights into the
   interaction of drivers (bark beetles, wildfire, fuel management) that
   increase the risk of C loss and shifting community composition if bark
   beetle outbreaks become more frequent.}},

Abstract = {{The ponderosa pine forests in the Davis Mountains of western Texas
   recently experienced a major mortality event caused, in part, by an
   extended regional drought that predisposed trees and stands to mortality
   from both western pine beetle and wildfires. The loss of many overstory
   pines and the scarcity of natural ponderosa pine regeneration pose a
   considerable challenge to restoration. A commissioned study investigated
   artificial regeneration using containerized ponderosa pine seedlings
   with multiple planting seasons and vegetation management alternatives.
   Early survival was statistically greater for dormant season plantings
   than monsoon season plantings. Vegetation management treatments
   influenced early growth, survival, and herbivory rates. Physical weed
   control, which consisted of fibrous weed mats around the base of planted
   seedlings, showed early advantages over some vegetation management
   treatments in growth, survival and herbivory deterrence, but all
   vegetation management treatments had similar survival and herbivory
   results after 2.5 years. Early survival was poor in all treatments,
   mainly due to herbivory, which was identified as the principal
   short-term obstacle to artificial regeneration of ponderosa pine in the
   Davis Mountains. The larger question regarding feasibility of recovery
   in this isolated population, particularly if local climatic conditions
   become increasingly unfavorable, remains.}},

Abstract = {{Determining targets in forest restoration is a complicated task that can
   be facilitated by cooperative partnerships. Too often restoration plans
   are implemented after adverse events that cause widespread tree
   mortality, such as drought or insect outbreaks, have occurred. Reactive
   management precludes the use of preemptive management techniques that
   can result in more effective restoration. The potential recognition and
   risks associated with a large-scale mortality event cultivated a
   proactive partnership among managers, stakeholders, and researchers on
   the Daniel Boone National Forest in Kentucky. This partnership resulted
   in the development of innovative proactive approaches to mitigate the
   negative impacts of threat of declining forest health, thus reducing the
   need for untested and expensive postdisturbance restorative operations.
   The partnership comprised four Research Work Units in the USDA Forest
   Service (including the Northern and Southern Research Stations), three
   universities (one land grant and two liberal arts), two natural resource
   state agencies, private logging contractors, an electrical utility, and
   National Forest system personnel at the district, forest supervisor, and
   Washington office levels. We tested forest management prescriptions
   designed to meet targets for future forest conditions. The goal of the
   silviculture treatments was to improve forest health and productivity to
   increase resilience to and/or avoidance of exotic invasive insect
   defoliation and oak decline. Treatments varied from high levels of
   disturbance to low levels of disturbance and ranged from even-aged
   regeneration treatments coupled with prescribed burning to thinning.
   Research assessed the alteration in species composition and stand
   structure, the projected regeneration outcomes and the costs and
   operational efficacy of mechanized forest operations used to implement
   the treatments. The relatively large scale of the study and diversity of
   treatments has afforded additional multidisciplinary research
   activities. Via partnership building and information and technology
   sharing, this project has been sustained for 10 years.}},

Abstract = {{Climate is a driving factor in forest health and productivity that

   activities such as deforestation and atmospheric pollution interact with
   climate, and may cause changes similar in magnitude to the
   glacial-interglacial epoch in the next 50 to 100 years. Effects of
   anthropogenic climate changes are ambiguous, however, and could
   counter-balance each other. For example, tree populations may have more
   difficulty reestablishing, but growth rates could accelerate.
   Conversely, management actions can mitigate the effect of climate on
   fisheries, water resources, wildfire, and floods. Also, management
   actions can affect climate by modifying carbon exchange and water and

Abstract = {{Lichens are an important component of the boreal forest, where they are
   long lived, tend to accumulate in older stands, and are a major food
   source for the threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou).
   To be fully sustainable, silvicultural practices in the boreal forest
   must include the conservation of ecological integrity. Dominant forest
   management practices, however, have short-term negative effects on
   lichen diversity, particularly the application of herbicides. To better
   understand the long-term effects of forest management, we examined
   lichen regeneration in 35 mixed black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack
   pine (Pinus banksiana) forest stands across northern Ontario to
   determine recovery following logging and postharvest silvicultural
   practices. Our forest stands were 25-40 years old and had undergone 3
   common sivilcultural treatments that included harvested and planted;
   harvested, planted, and treated with N-{[}phosphonomethyl] glycine
   (glyphosate); and harvested, planted, and treated with
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Forest stands with herbicide
   treatments had lower lichen biomass and higher beta and gamma diversity
   than planted stands that were not treated chemically or control stands.
   In northwestern Ontario, planted stands that were not treated chemically
   had significantly greater (p < 0.05) alpha diversity than stands treated
   with herbicides or control stands. Our results show that common
   silvicultural practices do not emulate natural disturbances caused by
   wildfires in the boreal forest for the lichen community. We suggest a
   reduction in the amount of chemical application be considered in areas
   where lichen biomass is likely to be high and where the recovery of
   woodland caribou is an objective. Conservacion de Liquenes en Bosques
   Boreales Manejados Intensivamente
   Resumen Los liquenes son un componente importante del bosque boreal,
   donde son longevos y tienden a acumularse en bosques viejos, y son una
   fuente mayor de alimento para el caribu (Rangifer tarandus caribou),
   amenazado. Para ser totalmente sustentables, las practicas
   silviculturales en el bosque boreal deben incluir la conservacion de la
   integridad ecologica. Sin embargo, las practicas dominantes de manejo de
   bosque, particularmente la aplicacion de herbicidas, tienen efectos
   negativos a corto plazo sobre la diversidad de liquenes. Para una mejor
   comprension de los efectos a largo plazo del manejo de bosques,
   examinamos la regeneracion de liquenes en 35 parcelas de bosque mixto de
   Picea mariana y Pinus banksiana en el norte de Ontario para determinar
   la recuperacion despues de la tala y de practicas silviculturales
   postcosecha. Nuestras parcelas tenian 25-40 anos de edad y tuvieron 3
   tratamientos silviculturales comunes que incluyeron cosecha y siembra;
   cosecha, siembra y tratamiento con N-{[}fosfonometil] glicina
   (glifosfato); y cosecha, siembra y tratamiento con 2,4-acido

   sembradas que no fueron tratadas quimicamente tuvieron una diversidad
   alfa significativamente mayor (p < 0.05) que las parcelas tratadas con

   las practicas silviculturales no emulan las perturbaciones naturales

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic and natural habitat fragmentation inhibit movement of
   animals through landscapes. An important challenge for connectivity
   conservation is determining which conditions facilitate or limit
   movements, so that these areas can be prioritized for protection or
   restoration. We examine Canada lynx Lynx canadensis habitat connectivity
   in the fragmented North Cascade Mountains of Washington, as an example
   of a highly mobile species that is specialized both on prey and in
   habitat needs. We identify lynx Habitat Concentration Areas based on
   Core Habitat Models, parameterize resistance surfaces from our Matrix
   Habitat Model, and develop linkages of habitat lynx use to move between
   patches of high quality habitat. We identify a number of linkages for
   lynx comprised of habitat conditions that differed from high quality
   core patches identified from our habitat modeling. Radio-locations from
   lynx confirm lower-quality habitats of low resistance to movement were
   used by traveling lynx. Our results thus suggest traveling lynx do
   indeed use a much broader range of habitats than do lynx moving within
   core areas. For lynx in the North Cascades, our results show that
   maintaining connectivity will require preserving habitats and linkages
   that would previously have been deemed unsuitable for lynx. Maintaining
   connectivity for lynx is particularly important given the many recent
   large wildfires in this region that have reduced the number of mature
   forest stands that form prime habitat for lynx. Policy implications. Our
   results strongly suggest that habitat connectivity models should be
   based on empirical information of animal location data and focused on
   matrix habitat analysis. Traveling predators use a wide suite of
   habitats, resulting in more and broader linkage zones that should inform
   conservation efforts. Failure to identify these areas of functional
   connectivity could result in the oversight of usable linkage zones,
   leaving them without protection and vulnerable to degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of atmospheric
   carbon dioxide ({[}CO2]) is expected to result in warmer temperatures
   and changed precipitation regimes during this century. In the
   northwestern U.S., these changes will likely decrease snowpack, cause
   earlier snowmelt, increase summer evapotranspiration, and increase the
   frequency and severity of droughts. Elevated {[}CO2] and warmer
   temperatures may have positive effects on growth and productivity where
   there is adequate moisture or growth is currently limited by cold.
   However, the effects of climate change are generally expected to reduce
   growth and survival, predispose forests to disturbance by wildfire,
   insects, and disease; and ultimately change forest structure and
   composition at the landscape scale. Substantial warming will likely
   decrease winter chilling resulting in delayed bud burst, and adversely
   affect flowering and seed germination for some species. The extent of
   these effects will depend on the magnitude of climate change, the
   abilities of individual trees to acclimate, and for tree populations to
   adapt in situ, or to migrate to suitable habitats. These coping
   mechanisms may be insufficient to maintain optimal fitness of tree
   populations to rapidly changing climate. Physiological responses to
   climatic stresses are relatively well-understood at the organ or
   whole-plant scale but not at the stand or landscape scale. In
   particular, the interactive effects of multiple stressors is not well
   known. Genetic and silvicultural approaches to increase adaptive
   capacities and to decrease climate-related vulnerabilities of forests
   can be based on ecophysiological knowledge. Effective approaches to
   climate adaptation will likely include assisted migration of species and
   populations, and density management. Use of these approaches to increase
   forest resistance and resilience at the landscape scale requires a
   better understanding of species adaptations, within-species genetic
   variation, and the mitigating effects of silvicultural treatments. (c)

Abstract = {{Primary Industries and Regions South Australia (PIRSA) staff are called
   on to assist in assessment and management of livestock affected by
   bushfires in South Australia. Methods and circumstances of euthanasia or
   treatments and decision-making at times of high stress can be complex
   with many variables. Some surviving animals will require monitoring and
   treatment. This paper describes the success rates and treatments in four
   cases in South Australia. It is helpful to advise producers of previous
   experience and results and give a qualified prognosis, especially when
   there is a temptation to destroy large numbers of livestock where some
   could be saved. There are significant psychological benefits for
   producers and communities when animals can be saved from being destroyed
   and some hope for recovery is given. Decisions involving euthanasia or
   management and treatment are made from day one through the weeks
   following a fire, but there are opportunities between days seven and ten
   for very effective medical and management intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Species range contractions are increasingly common globally. The
   niche reduction hypothesis posits that geographic range contractions are
   often patterned across space owing to heterogeneity in threat impacts
   and tolerance. We applied the niche reduction hypothesis to the decline
   of a threatened marsupial predator across northern Australia, the
   northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus). Location Northern Australia.
   Methods We assembled a database containing 3,178 historic and
   contemporary records for northern quolls across the extent of their
   distribution dating between 1778 and 2019. Based on these records, we
   estimated changes in the geographic range of the northern quoll using
   alpha-hulls across four main populations. We then examined how range
   contractions related to factors likely to mediate the exposure,
   susceptibility, or tolerance of northern quolls to threats. Result The
   extent of range contractions showed an east-west gradient, most likely
   reflecting the timing of spread of introduced cane toads (Rhinella
   marina). There were clear changes in environmental characteristics
   within the contemporary compared to the historic geographic range, with
   the most substantial occurring in populations that have suffered the
   greatest range contractions. The contemporary range is comprised of
   higher quality habitats (measured using environmental niche models),
   characterized by higher topographical ruggedness and annual rainfall,
   and reduced distance to water, compared to the historic range. Main
   conclusions Changes to range and niche likely reflect the capacity of
   complex habitats to ameliorate threats (namely predation and altered
   fire regimes), and access to resources that increase threat tolerance.
   This study highlights the multivariate nature of ecological refuges and
   the importance of high-quality habitats for the persistence of species
   exposed to multiple threats. Our methods provide a useful framework
   which can be applied across taxa in providing valuable insight to
   management.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL CONSERVATION}},
Abstract = {{Despite the growing roles of assisted reproduction and captive breeding
   in reintroductions, we have a limited understanding of the viability of
   these animals once released. We radiotracked endangered dusky gopher
   frogs Lithobates sevosus for up to 24 days after they were released into
   the wild to (1) assess the viability of juvenile frogs produced using
   artificial fertilization and raised in captivity until four weeks
   post-metamorphosis, (2) investigate survival rates, movement patterns,
   and habitat use and (3) examine whether it is more beneficial to release
   frogs at the pond edge or into burrows in the uplands. Released frogs
   had a relatively high survival rate (76\% overall, with mortality
   ceasing after 14 days) and behaved as expected, moving fairly long
   distances (up to 153 m daily and 426 m total) and locating suitable
   shelters, including burrows and stump holes. Frogs that sheltered
   underground had a 22\% higher survival rate than frogs that did not,
   highlighting the importance of these habitat features. Compared to frogs
   released into burrows, frogs released at the pond had a 33\% lower
   survival rate, spent less time underground and moved farther and more
   often, likely while searching for shelter. Frogs selected habitat
   characteristics that are associated with effects of fire, including an
   open canopy and abundant ground vegetation. Our study demonstrates that
   juvenile dusky gopher frogs successfully transitioned to their natural
   habitat, and that any effects of artificial fertilization or captivity
   on juvenile viability appear to be minimal. Releasing frogs into areas
   with abundant underground refuges and using frequent prescribed fire to
   maintain the habitat should benefit dusky gopher frog populations and
   improve the success of reintroductions.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{689-710}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Biotic invaders are species that establish a new range in which they
   proliferate, spread, and persist to the detriment of the environment.
   They are the most important ecological outcomes from the unprecedented
   alterations in the distribution of the earth's biota brought about
   largely through human transport and commerce. In a world without
   borders, few if any areas remain sheltered from these immigrations.
   The fate of immigrants is decidedly mixed. Few survive the hazards of
   chronic and stochastic forces, and only a small fraction become
   naturalized. In turn, some naturalized species do become invasive. There
   are several potential reasons why some immigrant species prosper: some
   escape from the constraints of their native predators or parasites;
   others are aided by human-caused disturbance that disrupts native
   communities. Ironically, many biotic invasions are apparently
   facilitated by cultivation and husbandry, unintentional actions that
   foster immigrant populations until they are self-perpetuating and
   uncontrollable. Whatever the cause, biotic invaders can in many cases
   inflict enormous environmental damage: (1) Animal invaders can cause
   extinctions of vulnerable native species through predation, grazing,
   competition, and habitat alteration. (2) Plant invaders can completely
   alter the fire regime, nutrient cycling, hydrology, and energy budgets
   in a native ecosystem and can greatly diminish the abundance or survival
   of native species. (3) In agriculture, the principal pests of temperate
   crops are nonindigenous, and the combined expenses of pest control and
   crop losses constitute an onerous ``tax{''} on food, fiber, and forage
   production. (4) The global cost of virulent plant and animal diseases
   caused by parasites transported to new ranges and presented with
   susceptible new hosts is currently incalculable.
   Identifying future invaders and taking effective steps to prevent their
   dispersal and establishment constitutes an enormous challenge to both
   conservation and international commerce. Detection and management when
   exclusion fails have proved daunting for varied reasons: (1) Efforts to
   identify general attributes of future invaders have often been
   inconclusive. (2) Predicting susceptible locales for future invasions
   seems even more problematic, given the enormous differences in the rates
   of arrival among potential invaders. (3) Eradication of an established
   invader is rare, and control efforts vary enormously in their efficacy.
   Successful control, however, depends more on commitment and continuing
   diligence than on the efficacy of specific tools themselves. (4) Control
   of biotic invasions is most effective when it employs a long-term,
   ecosystem-wide strategy rather than a tactical approach focused on
   battling individual invaders. (5) Prevention of invasions is much less
   costly than post-entry control. Revamping national and international
   quarantine laws by adopting a ``guilty until proven innocent{''}
   approach would be a productive first step.
   Failure to address the issue of biotic invasions could effectively
   result in severe global consequences, including wholesale loss of
   agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources in some regions,
   disruption of the ecological processes that supply natural services on
   which human enterprise depends, and the creation of homogeneous,
   impoverished ecosystems composed of cosmopolitan species. Given their
   current scale, biotic invasions have taken their place alongside
   human-driven atmospheric and oceanic alterations as major agents of
   global change. Left unchecked, they will influence these other forces in
   profound but still unpredictable ways.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To examine the extent to which succession from tropical savanna to
   rain forest in the long-term absence of fire is matched by successional
   changes in ant communities. This is done by describing ant community
   responses to 23 years of fire exclusion in a northern Australian
   tropical savanna, with a particular focus on the extent of colonization
   by specialist rain forest taxa.
   Location Solar Village, near Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory.
   Methods Ants were sampled within 12 plots located inside ('unburnt'-
   protected from fire for 23 years) and outside (burnt every 1-2 years)
   Solar Village in ridge and slope habitat dominated by Eucalyptus spp.
   The litter, ground-foraging and arboreal faunas were sampled separately,
   using Berlese funnels, unbaited pitfall traps and baited pitfall traps
   attached to tree trunks, respectively. Each species was assigned a
   forest-association score ranging from 0 (open savanna species) to 3
   (specialist forest species) based on their known habitat preferences in
   the region.
   Results A total of 85 ant species from 35 genera were recorded, with
   multivariate analysis demonstrating distinct litter, ground and arboreal
   communities. Ant communities also varied substantially with topographic
   position, which interacted strongly with fire exclusion. A total of 72
   species were recorded in burnt habitat, compared with only 45 in
   unburnt, and the number of ant species records was also about twice as
   high in burnt compared with unburnt habitat. Fire exclusion has resulted
   in a dramatic increase in forest-associated taxa (those occurring in
   forest and denser, but rarely open, savanna), with such species
   representing 51\% of species records in unburnt habitat compared with
   19\% in burnt. However, only five specialist forest species were
   recorded, representing < 1\% of total ant records.
   Main conclusions Fire exclusion at Solar Village has markedly increased
   the prevalence of forest-associated ant species, but has led to only
   very minor incursions by specialist rain forest ant taxa. These
   responses match very closely those of the vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Relict sites are geographically isolated areas that are undisturbed by
   direct and indirect human influences. These sites facilitate long-term
   ecological monitoring by providing a reference for gauging impacts
   occurring elsewhere. Knowledge gained through comparing vegetation
   change on matched relict and proximal disturbed areas can help partition
   the causes of change into natural and human-produced components.
   Fishtail Mesa in Grand Canyon National Park is a 439-ha relict site that
   is inaccessible to domestic livestock. Human visitation is infrequent
   and irregular, and fires have never been suppressed or managed. In 1958,
   U.S. Forest Sen;ice range scientists conducted a survey of Fishtail Mesa
   to gather reference data on vegetation, wildlife, and soils. Vegetation
   sampling was conducted using a method called the ``elb.{''} We returned
   to Fishtail Mesa in May 1996 to perform a general vegetation and
   floristic sun ey, assess the extent of vegetation change after 38 years,
   and evaluate the suitability of the site as a location for long-term
   surveillance of ecological change. Fishtail Mesa's vegetation consists
   primarily of a Pinus edulis (pinyon) and Juniperus osteosperma (Utah
   juniper) woodland with an Artemisia tridentata (sagebrush) understory,
   or tree-type (310.9 ha), and an Artemisia and Poa fendleriana (mutton
   grass) steppe, or shrub-ripe (127.5 ha). Since 1958 vegetation changes
   in both shrub- and tree-types have been limited to only a few species.
   In the shrub-type we detected slight increases from 1958 to 1996 in both
   Pinus and Juniperus, and reexamination of 1958 photo sites confirmed
   that Pinus and Juniperus are reoccupying the shrub-type. Artemisia cover
   declined from 1998 to 1996, whereas Poa increased from near trace
   amounts in 1958 to moderate cover in 1996. In the tree-type, Poa has
   increased from 1958 to 1996, while Artemisia, Juniperus, and Pinus
   showed no apparent change. Other species such as Ephedra torreyana
   (Torrey joint-fir), Opuntia polyacantha (prickly pear), and Gutierrezia
   sarothrae (snakeweed) have decreased. Vegetation analysis aided by
   TWINSPAN revealed that the shrub-type is defined more on the basis of
   absence of Pinus and Juniperus rather than any special association of
   differential species with a high preference for this type. We interpret
   the ``invasion{''} of the shrub-type by Pin us and Juniperus as a
   ``reoccupation.{''} Indirect ordination using DECORANA inferred 2
   environmental gradients, a moisture gradient and perhaps a substrate
   texture gradient, that appeared to influence vegetation distribution on
   Fishtail Mesa. Fishtail Mesa is a valuable relict area for studying the
   effects of livestock grazing and prescribed fire. It should be
   designated a Federal Research Natural Area based on its vegetation
   communities, size, and protection afforded by its location in Grand
   Canyon National Park.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances are frequent events across the Canadian boreal forest and
   can affect both below- and above-ground ecosystem processes. How
   disturbances change below-ground soil fungal communities and in-turn
   affect pine establishment and performance is poorly understood. Such
   understanding has become increasingly important in light of observed
   changes in disturbance regimes in recent years due to climate change.
   We used a greenhouse experiment to determine how soil inoculum collected
   from lodgepole pine stands undisturbed (control) or disturbed by fire,
   mountain pine beetle outbreak, logging and salvage logging affect pine
   seedling performance in western Canada. We first characterized whether
   fungal communities of seedling roots change as a function of inoculum
   source, and then determined whether changes in fungal community
   composition impact pine seedling performance (biomass and height).
   Root fungal communities of pine seedlings from logged and salvage logged
   disturbances differed from their respective paired controls, while soils
   from natural disturbances (fire and beetle outbreak) did not. Among
   disturbances, the pine root fungal communities of fire and salvage
   logged disturbances differed.
   In parallel to the root fungal communities, seedling performance also
   decreased when comparing logging and salvage logging disturbances to
   paired controls. Among disturbance treatments, seedlings from the
   salvage logged disturbance did not grow as big as seedlings inoculated
   with soils from burned forests.
   Synthesis and application. Our findings indicate that anthropogenic
   disturbances (logging and salvage logging) can have cross-generational
   impacts on pine seedling performance, through functional shifts in
   seedling root fungal community structure. Furthermore, the impacts of
   soil fungi on pine seedlings appear to be pronounced following salvage
   logging, stressing the importance of compound disturbance events. These
   findings may be important to land managers considering clear-cut logging
   or salvage logging in pine forests, particularly where soil biotic
   communities are likely to be one of the predominate factors in pine
   establishment.}},

Abstract = {{The ecology of one breeding population of Carnaby's Cockatoo
   Calyptorhynchus latirostris has been studied at Coomallo Creek, Western
   Australia, since 1969. A wildfire destroyed breeding habitat in part of
   the study area and adjoining areas in late December 2009. An increase in
   the number of breeding attempts the following year suggested that
   hollows were probably limiting. From 2011, the number of hollows
   available to the cockatoos was increased by repairing derelict natural
   hollows and providing artificial hollows. By 2017, cockatoos had access
   to 87 natural and 68 artificial hollows the approximate dimensions of
   natural hollows. Artificial hollows were readily accepted, however there
   were significant differences in the probability of hollows being used
   due to location and land use type. Despite floor temperatures of black
   and white artificial hollows being warmer than those of natural hollows,
   there were no significant differences in the probability of hollow use,
   the probability of breeding failures, and nestling condition in either
   white or black artificial hollows or natural hollows. The number of
   breeding attempts rose from 52 in 2011 to 127 in 2016 indicating that
   management intervention was effective. Between 2011 and 2018, artificial
   hollows provided 45\% of available hollows and 54\% of breeding attempts
   were made in them. By 2018, the number of breeding attempts in the area
   was 112\% higher than in 2011. Artificial hollows provide an excellent

   speculate that competition control made seedlings more susceptible to
   browsing by deer or damage by heavy snow and ice accumulation. The
   competitive ability of red oak on these sites is such that it will
   respond well to even late release from normal competition resulting from

Abstract = {{The 2010 Church's Park Fire burned beetle-killed lodgepole pine stands
   in Colorado, including recently salvage-logged areas, creating a
   fortuitous opportunity to compare the effects of salvage logging,
   wildfire and the combination of logging followed by wildfire. Here, we
   examine tree regeneration, surface fuels, understory plants, inorganic
   soil nitrogen and water infiltration in uncut and logged stands, outside
   and inside the fire perimeter. Subalpine fir recruitment was abundant in
   uncut, unburned, beetle-killed stands, whereas lodgepole pine
   recruitment was abundant in cut stands. Logging roughly doubled woody
   fuel cover and halved forb and shrub cover. Wildfire consumed all
   conifer seedlings in uncut and cut stands and did not stimulate new
   conifer regeneration within four years of the fire. Aspen regeneration,
   in contrast, was relatively unaffected by logging or burning, alone or
   combined. Wildfire also drastically reduced cover of soil organic
   horizons, fine woody fuels, graminoids and shrubs relative to unburned,
   uncut areas; moreover, the compound effect of logging and wildfire was
   generally similar to wildfire alone. This case study documents scarce
   conifer regeneration but ample aspen regeneration after a wildfire that

Abstract = {{Worldwide forests have been impacted by broad-scale anthropogenic
   pressures, such as fire and logging, leading to the disruption of the
   structure and functioning of these systems. The present paper examined
   the applicability of a holistic Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) in
   predicting the tendencies of passerine bird communities in maritime pine
   (Pinus pinaster) stands as a response to the changes induced by fire
   occurrence. The StDM is a sequential modelling process developed in
   order to predict the ecological status of changed ecosystems, from which
   management strategies can be designed. The case of the pine stands of
   central Portugal was used to test the StDM performance in the scope of
   the wildfire problems. The datasets used in the dynamic model
   construction included the main gradients of environmental and biological
   characteristics of the studied maritime pine stands over space and time.
   The ecological integrity of the pine stands can be partly assessed by
   the observation of the occurrence of passerine indicators. The dynamic
   model developed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical
   procedure performed to discriminate the significant relationships
   between conceptually isolated key-components of the studied ecosystems.
   The final model provided some basis to analyse the responses of selected
   passerine indicators to fire scenarios that characterize the region. In
   this context, the simulation results are encouraging since they seem to
   demonstrate the StDM reliability in capturing the passerine community
   dynamics by predicting the behavioural pattern of indicators roughly
   associated with their structural and functional composition and habitat
   main characteristics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The use of fynbos fragments by birds: Stepping-stone habitats and
   resource refugia}},
Journal = {{KOEDOE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Fynbos habitats are threatened by fragmentation through land use and
   anthropogenic changes in fire regimes, leading to a loss of suitable
   habitat for birds. We investigated the response ofyfynbos-typical
   avifauna to fragmentation and postfire vegetation age in order to better
   understand the consequences of these processes for bird communities.
   Vegetation composition and bird inventory data were collected along
   wandering transects in three South Outeniqua Sandstone Fynbos habitat
   configurations: fragmented patches (associated with anthropogenically
   driven habitat loss < 150 years ago), naturally isolated fynbos islands
   (formed through climate-driven forest expansion in the Holocene) and
   extensive areas of relatively pristine habitat known as `mainland'. The
   latter configurations served as references against which to investigate
   bird and vegetation responses to more recent habitat fragmentation.
   Linear regressions were used to compare the relationships of a number of
   bird and plant species to areas between each habitat configuration. Bird
   attribute frequency data were compared between habitat configurations
   using chi-square tests. Birds and plants showed significant species-area
   relationships in natural island and mainland sites, but no such
   relationship occurred in artificial fragments for birds, where the
   surrounding anthropogenic land uses are likely to have contributed
   generalist or colonist species. Avifaunal migratory groups were not
   affected by isolation distances of > 10 km in this study and their
   frequencies were the same across the three habitat configurations.
   Certain feeding guilds did, however, respond to postfire vegetation age,
   with nectarivore species twice as likely to occur in old-growth mainland
   fynbos. Fragmentation can alter fire disturbance regimes, which in turn
   alter the availability of resources in a habitat, so the impacts of
   fragmentation on birds are probably indirect through changes in the
   vegetation component.
   Conservation implications: Fragments of South Outeniqua Sandstone Fynbos
   have value as resource refugia and `stepping-stone' reserves for
   avifauna. Fragments should be managed for vegetation age to ensure that
   at least some patches sustain high levels of nectar-producing plant
   species. Fire management should, however, factor in both plant and bird
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{In Brazil, a severe dry season lasting for approximately 5 months and
   frequent fires make life difficult for cerrado insects. In certain
   aspects, the cerrado can be considered to be an understudied ecosystem;
   even basic information such as knowledge about the annual peak in
   abundance of different insect orders is unknown. Insect abundance
   patterns have only been investigated for a few groups in the cerrado
   region. Thus, our study concerns the temporal distribution of insect
   abundance in the savanna-like vegetation of the central Brazilian
   cerrado (sensu stricto) in Distrito Federal. The region has a
   well-defined, long dry season between May and September. The insects
   were sampled by window, malaise tent and pitfall traps within 1 year. We
   used a multiple linear regression to analyse the relationship between
   abundance of insects of each order and climate variables. A total of 50
   127 individuals from 15 orders was collected. The orders were Coleoptera
   (26\%), Hymenoptera (23\%), Diptera (20.5\%), Isoptera (20\%), Homoptera
   (4\%), Lepidoptera (4\%), Orthoptera (1.5\%) and Hemiptera (1\%). The
   abundance of Diptera, Homoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera was randomly
   distributed over time, Isoptera peaked in the first half of the wet
   season, Coleoptera and Hemiptera in the second half of the wet season
   and Hymenoptera in each season. A significant correlation was found only
   between Coleoptera and delayed climatic variables. There were no obvious
   trends that might help explain the abundance patterns observed. The
   study provides baseline information about phenological patterns of
   insect abundance and permits evaluation of this group as a resource for
   various food chains and different trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{Linked atmospheric and wildfire changes will complicate future

   effects can be at least partially offset by managing factors such as

   local management can significantly reduce the vulnerability of bull
   trout to climate change given appropriate management actions. Tools such

Abstract = {{The first human migrants entering South America must have used the
   Isthmian route. Convincing archaeological evidence for pre-Clovis groups
   is lacking. Paleoindian artifacts including Clovis and Fishtail fluted
   projectile points have been found at several localities, but at only one
   site (Vampiros-1) in buried and radiocarbon-dated deposits (similar to
   11,500-similar to 9000 BP). Close similarities between Clovis point
   reduction sequences at two Panamanian quarry-workshops to those of early
   US Clovis sites vouch for temporal proximity and suggest rapid movement
   of Clovis bands through Central America, 11,050-10,800 BP. Vampiros-1
   and other rock-shelters were occupied during the early Holocene
   (10,000-7000 BP) when climate became warmer and wetter. Un-fluted
   bifacial projectile points were made until similar to 7000 BP.
   Widespread grinding stones and carbonized tree fruits announce a mixed
   economy at the beginning of the Holocene. Cultivated leren, arrowroot,
   squash and bottle gourd appeared by 8000 BP. There are no indicators of
   human activities at Lake La Yeguada (650 m asl), 14,000-11,150 BP, nor
   at Vampiros-1, 16,000-11,500 BP. Pre-Clovis populations were probably
   bound to the now-drowned Pacific coast. Intense burning and
   deforestation commenced at La Yeguada similar to 11,050 BP coevally with
   Clovis. Human impacts were thenceforth continuous. Swidden farming had
   largely removed forest cover by 7000 BP across seasonally arid Central
   Pacific Panama. Lake sediment data from forested areas with less
   seasonal climates on the Caribbean and Pacific watersheds indicate
   moderate human interference before 7000 BP. The mtDNA history of modern

Abstract = {{Aim Species range contractions are increasingly common globally. The
   niche reduction hypothesis posits that geographic range contractions are
   often patterned across space owing to heterogeneity in threat impacts
   and tolerance. We applied the niche reduction hypothesis to the decline
   of a threatened marsupial predator across northern Australia, the
   northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus). Location Northern Australia.
   Methods We assembled a database containing 3,178 historic and
   contemporary records for northern quolls across the extent of their
   distribution dating between 1778 and 2019. Based on these records, we
   estimated changes in the geographic range of the northern quoll using
   alpha-hulls across four main populations. We then examined how range
   contractions related to factors likely to mediate the exposure,
   susceptibility, or tolerance of northern quolls to threats. Result The
   extent of range contractions showed an east-west gradient, most likely
   reflecting the timing of spread of introduced cane toads (Rhinella
   marina). There were clear changes in environmental characteristics
   within the contemporary compared to the historic geographic range, with
   the most substantial occurring in populations that have suffered the
   greatest range contractions. The contemporary range is comprised of
   higher quality habitats (measured using environmental niche models),
   characterized by higher topographical ruggedness and annual rainfall,
   and reduced distance to water, compared to the historic range. Main
   conclusions Changes to range and niche likely reflect the capacity of
   complex habitats to ameliorate threats (namely predation and altered
   fire regimes), and access to resources that increase threat tolerance.
   This study highlights the multivariate nature of ecological refuges and
   the importance of high-quality habitats for the persistence of species
   exposed to multiple threats. Our methods provide a useful framework
   which can be applied across taxa in providing valuable insight to
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Forest pathology, the science of forest health and tree diseases, is
   operating in a rapidly developing environment. Most importantly, global
   trade and climate change are increasing the threat to forest ecosystems
   posed by new diseases. Various studies relevant to forest pathology in a
   changing world are accumulating, thus making it necessary to provide an
   update of recent literature. In this contribution, we summarize research
   at the interface between forest pathology and landscape ecology,
   biogeography, global change science and research on tree endophytes.
   Regional outbreaks of tree diseases are requiring interdisciplinary
   collaboration, e.g. between forest pathologists and landscape
   ecologists. When tree pathogens are widely distributed, the factors
   determining their broad-scale distribution can be studied using a
   biogeographic approach. Global change, the combination of climate and
   land use change, increased pollution, trade and urbanization, as well as
   invasive species, will influence the effects of forest disturbances such
   as wildfires, droughts, storms, diseases and insect outbreaks, thus
   affecting the health and resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide. Tree
   endophytes can contribute to biological control of infectious diseases,
   enhance tolerance to environmental stress or behave as opportunistic
   weak pathogens potentially competing with more harmful ones. New
   molecular techniques are available for studying the complete tree
   endobiome under the influence of global change stressors from the
   landscape to the intercontinental level. Given that exotic tree diseases
   have both ecologic and economic consequences, we call for increased

Abstract = {{Research on the impacts of wildfire and invasive plants in rangelands
   has focused on biophysical rather than human dimensions of these
   environmental processes. We offer a synthetic perspective on economic
   and social aspects of wildfire and invasive plants in American deserts,
   focusing on the Great Basin because greater research attention has been
   given to the effects of cheatgrass expansion than to other desert
   wildfire/invasion cycles. We focus first on impacts at the level of the
   individual decision-maker, then on impacts experienced at the human
   community or larger socio-political scales. Economic impacts of wildfire
   differ from those of invasive grasses because although fire typically
   reduces forage availability and thus ranch profit opportunities,
   invasive grasses can also be used as a forage source and ranchers have
   adapted their grazing systems to take advantage of that circumstance. To
   reduce the threat of increased ranch bankruptcies, strategies are needed
   that can increase access to alternative early-season forage sources
   and/or promote diversification of ranch income streams by capturing
   value from ranch ecosystem services other than forage. The growth of
   low-density, exurban subdivisions in Western deserts influences not only
   the pattern and frequency of wildfire and plant invasions but also
   affects prevailing public opinion toward potential management options,
   and thereby the capacity of land management agencies to use those
   options. Outreach efforts can influence public opinion, but must be
   rooted in new knowledge about multiple impacts of invasion and increased
   wildfire in American deserts.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation patterning is described for two neighbouring continental
   island chains off Arnhem Land, Australia. A total of 684 species was
   recorded from 57 islands, with reasonably comprehensive lists for 36 of
   these islands. Almost 90\% of the deviance in plant species richness was
   associated with island size. The richness of plants dispersed by sea
   and/or vertebrates was proportionally greater on small islands; that of
   relatively poor dispersers was greater on larger islands. Twelve
   vegetation communities were defined by classification of plant species
   composition in 226 50 x 50-m quadrats. There was no relationship between
   island size and species richness at the quadrat level, at least for the
   most extensive vegetation types. The vegetation of the islands is now
   composed of two main elements an original set of communities (mostly of
   heath, tussock grassland and eucalypt open forest) whose species have
   poor inter-island dispersal, and a set of more recent colonists (mostly
   of strand, mangrove and coastal thicket communities). The former group
   is allied to the sandstone flora of western Arnhem Land, but is
   species-poor in comparison, as the islands lack the deep gorges which
   drive much of the species richness of western Arnhem Land. The latter
   group comprises many species with a broad geographic range across
   tropical coastal areas, including many species which have been shown
   elsewhere to be highly vagile. Many species of the former set appear to
   have been lost from the smaller islands. The island flora has been
   influenced by three sets of human managers. Aboriginal use of the
   islands has been long-standing and probably resulted in a fire regime
   which may have accentuated environmental patchiness. Centuries of
   wet-season use of some islands by Macassan trepang-harvesters, ending
   early this century, has apparently left few effects other than the
   persistence of occasional small populations of an introduced food tree.
   In contrast, European use of these islands has been minimal and
   fleeting, but is associated with the introduction of most weeds.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forest development is influenced by both natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances that alter stand structure and nutrient
   cycling over decadal timescales. The effects of disturbance on boreal
   forests is likely to be modified by soil moisture, given that
   disturbance severity, vegetation structure and plant productivity vary
   between upland and lowland forest stands. Future changes in boreal
   vegetation dynamics are predicted to have consequences for a range of
   ecosystem services including climate feedbacks and wildlife management.
   Here, as part of a broader study on habitat use and forage of woodland
   caribou, we investigated the effects of soil drainage class (upland vs.
   lowland), disturbance (wildfire vs. timber harvest), and stand age on
   understory plant species richness, cover, biomass, productivity, and
   foliar C/N. Due to faster nutrient turnover rates in upland soils, we
   predicted that understory vegetation in uplands would be more
   productive, biodiverse and nutrient-rich than in lowlands. We also
   expected disturbance to lead to greater changes in understory vegetation
   in uplands, given that both fire and timber harvesting tend to be more
   severe in drier ecosystems. Our results showed that plant understory
   characteristics varied primarily between soil drainage classes, with few
   differences between stands recovering from wildfire or timber
   harvesting. Contrary to our predictions, lowland understory vegetation
   had greater total understory plant species richness, aboveground net
   primary productivity, and foliar C/N compared to upland understory
   vegetation. We also found no difference in total understory vegetation
   percent cover, productivity or foliar C/N between burned and harvested
   stands. Understory net primary productivity decreased with time
   following disturbance in uplands but increased nonlinearly with stand
   age in lowlands. Greater productivity in lowlands was attributed
   primarily to evergreen shrubs, though graminoids also were more
   productive in lowlands than in uplands. Our study has implications for
   the threatened woodland caribou with respect to the nutritional aspects
   of their habitat selection. Our results suggest that the commonly held
   assertion that, by selecting lowlands, caribou face a trade-off between
   lower predation risk and lower forage quality may be incorrect and
   requires further examination. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Climate, Environment, and Disturbance History Govern Resilience of
   Western North American Forests}},

Abstract = {{Before the advent of intensive forest management and fire suppression,
   western North American forests exhibited a naturally occurring
   resistance and resilience to wildfires and other disturbances.
   Resilience, which encompasses resistance, reflects the amount of
   disruption an ecosystem can withstand before its structure or
   organization qualitatively shift to a different basin of attraction. In
   fire-maintained forests, resilience to disturbance events arose
   primarily from vegetation pattern-disturbance process interactions at
   several levels of organization. Using evidence from 15 ecoregions,
   spanning forests from Canada to Mexico, we review the properties of
   forests that reinforced qualities of resilience and resistance. We show
   examples of multi-level landscape resilience, of feedbacks within and
   among levels, and how conditions have changed under climatic and
   management influences. We highlight geographic similarities and
   important differences in the structure and organization of historical
   landscapes, their forest types, and in the conditions that have changed
   resilience and resistance to abrupt or large-scale disruptions. We
   discuss the role of the regional climate in episodically or abruptly
   reorganizing plant and animal biogeography and forest resilience and
   resistance to disturbances. We give clear examples of these changes and
   suggest that managing for resilient forests is a construct that strongly
   depends on scale and human social values. It involves human communities
   actively working with the ecosystems they depend on, and the processes
   that shape them, to adapt landscapes, species, and human communities to
   climate change while maintaining core ecosystem processes and services.
   Finally, it compels us to embrace management approaches that incorporate
   ongoing disturbances and anticipated effects of climatic changes, and to
   support dynamically shifting patchworks of forest and non-forest. Doing
   so could make these shifting forest conditions and wildfire regimes less
   disruptive to individuals and society.}},

Abstract = {{If current trends continue, human activities will drastically alter most
   of the planet's remaining natural ecosystems and their composite biota
   within a few decades. Compounding the impacts on biodiversity from
   deleterious management practices is climate variability and change. The
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently concluded that
   there is ample evidence to suggest climate change is likely to result in
   significant impacts on biological diversity. These impacts are likely to
   be exacerbated by the secondary effects of climate change such as
   changes in the occurrence of wildfire, insect outbreaks and similar
   disturbances. Current changes in climate are very different from those
   of the past due to their rate and magnitude, the direct effects of
   increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and because highly modified
   landscapes and an array of threatening processes limit the ability of
   terrestrial ecosystems and species to respond to changed conditions. One
   of the primary human adaptation option for conserving biodiversity is
   considered to be changes in management. The complex and overarching
   nature of climate change issues emphasises the need for greatly enhanced
   cooperation between scientists, policy makers, industry and the
   community to better understand key interaction's and identify options
   for adaptation. A key challenge is to identify opportunities that
   facilitate sustainable development by making use of existing
   technologies and developing policies that enhance the resilience of
   climate-sensitive sectors. Measures to enhance the resilience of
   biodiversity must be considered in all of these activities if many
   ecosystem services essential to humanity are to be sustained. New
   institutional arrangements appear necessary at the regional and national
   level to ensure that policy initiatives and research directed at
   assessing and mitigating the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate
   change are complementary and undertaken strategically and
   cost-effectively. Policy implementation at the national level to meet
   responsibilities arising from the UNFCCC (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol) and
   the UN Convention on Biological Diversity require greater coordination
   and integration between economic sectors, since many primary drivers of
   biodiversity loss and vulnerability are influenced at this level. A case
   study from the Australian continent is used to illustrate several key
   issues and discuss a basis for reform, including recommendations for
   facilitating adaptation to climate variability and change.}},

Abstract = {{Scrub oak barrens were once distributed throughout portions of the
   northeastern United States. This fire-dependent community covered over
   809,000 ha in Pennsylvania during the mid-1900s, but was reduced to
   about 7132 ha by the late 1900s. Decline of scrub oak barrens is
   attributed to development, fire suppression, and colonization by
   fire-intolerant trees. Scrub oak barrens are a state imperiled ecosystem
   and in recent years, efforts to restore late successional barrens
   through mechanical cutting and prescribed fire have been initiated in
   Pennsylvania. Scrub oak barrens support high species richness, including
   several rare or declining species of plants and animals. This ecosystem
   is also known for supporting rare Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth)
   species. We used light traps and bait stations to compare Lepidoptera
   communities in restored and late successional scrub oak barrens in
   northeastern Pennsylvania. A total of 13,386 individuals were
   identified, representing 373 species. Nine species are state-listed,
   with four of these species detected exclusively in restored barrens. Few
   differences in Lepidoptera species richness, diversity, or abundance
   were found between restored and late successional barrens. Moth
   communities were similar across all sites and forb presence partially
   explained moth variance. Several species (n = 197) were found in both
   restored and late successional sites. However, several species were
   unique to restored (n = 128) and late successional sites (n = 48). Our
   findings suggest scrub oak barrens should be managed to create a mosaic
   of successional stages throughout the landscape if Lepidoptera diversity
   is a conservation goal.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained timber harvesting conflicts with the long-term viability of
   boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. The spatial
   arrangement of harvest blocks in the landscape could mitigate the impact
   of logging on caribou populations. For the forest industry, however,
   these measures represent constraints that reduce the annual allowable
   cut (AAC).
   Estimate the long-term impacts of spatial constraints to harvesting,
   applied alone or in combination, on AAC and boreal caribou populations.
   We divided a 30,000 km(2) region into 20 harvest block sizes varying
   from 50 to 1000 km(2), and modeled the implementation of spatially
   explicit harvest schedule plans in combination with wildfire and caribou
   population dynamics. We then evaluated the probability of persistence of
   boreal caribou populations.
   The probability of maintaining an AAC target declined with increasing
   target AAC, increasing size of operating area, and increasing adjacency
   constraints. In contrast, the probability of maintaining caribou
   populations declined with increasing AAC, decreasing size of operating
   areas, and decreasing adjacency constraints. An increase in operating
   area size from 50 to 300 km(2) produced a considerable gain in AAC for
   all adjacency constraints.
   Because adjacency constraints led only to a small increase in the
   probability of maintaining caribou populations, we recommend adopting
   less constraining landscape management actions, such as a 70-year period
   between two consecutive harvests in the same similar to 300-km(2)
   operating area.}},

Abstract = {{Federal laboratories are often caught between the need to meet mission
   objectives and the mandate to act as national stewards for natural
   resources. Following the initiation of the Manhattan Project in 1943,
   restricted land use at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) retained
   many undisturbed areas that function as ecosystem sanctuaries for plants
   and animals throughout the 43 mi(2) site. We developed a Quantitative
   Habitat Analysis (QHA) that enables both managers and scientists to
   better meet the goals of ecosystem management and sustainable
   development for LANL. QHA is a multi-faceted modeling, planning, and
   management tool with the goal of applying existing models in a new way.
   QHA provides an objective, standardized, and replicable system for
   management of wild areas by federal agencies. As part of the development
   of QHA, we reviewed 42 existing wildlife and habitat models,
   assessments, or evaluation methods and 12 computer programs. A pilot
   field study was conducted on 12 plots testing five different methods to
   determine the most suitable for data collection for the tool. Once
   methods were selected and models determined, a QHA application tool was
   created in ArcView to test the pilot data within the tool for
   user-friendly application. This year, 45 field sites were sampled. QHA
   currently comprises five main sub-models analyzed within a geographic
   information system using ArcView: 1) Ecological Land Classification
   (landscape level effects), 2) Rapid Ecological Assessment (general
   assessment)/U.S. National Vegetation Classification Element Occurrence
   (ecosystem ``health{''}), 3) BEHAVE (wildfire and fuels monitoring), 4)
   Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (wildlife), and 5) ECORSK.6
   (bio-contaminants). Key to this QHA tool was the use of ``common
   currencies.{''} The common currencies consist of weighted scores that
   calculate a ``grade{''} or means of comparison between different
   programs and scoring methods. Development and calibration of the QHA

Abstract = {{Semi-arid shrublands are prone to wildfires especially if there are no
   firebreaks separating shrubs to reduce the spread of fire. The
   accumulated grass vegetation is a potential combustion source which also
   contributes to the spread of wildfires. We present a field study
   conducted in a semi-arid community, where the fire risk is high and the
   grass density surrounding the Juniperus communis shrubs is highly
   varied. We tested simultaneously the relative significance of the main
   factors contributing to plant cover around shrubs: allelopathy, shading,
   and herbivory. Grass cover was compared around junipers which were
   either currently occupied by rabbits or were unoccupied. We visually
   estimated plant cover and measured the Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index. Both sides of the shrubs were sampled at various distances to see
   if allelopathy and/or shading reduced grass density. The allelopathy
   effect was also tested by lettuce bioassay. We found that the vegetation
   was open only around occupied junipers and that the effect of occupation
   decreased by distance from the shrub. The spatial distribution of plant
   cover showed that, although we could detect significant allelopathic
   effect of juniper by bioassay, neither the shading nor the allelopathy
   were as important as herbivory. We also compared the rabbit diet
   composition with plant availability for each occupied patch and found
   that the consumed species were under represented due to selective
   grazing. Our findings indicate that local herbivore activity could
   affect the spatial heterogeneity of combustible material, therefore,
   moderate rabbit grazing can be considered as a management tool to reduce
   the spread of fire.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of silvicultural treatments on lichen, moss and liver-wort
   communities was investigated as a component of the FORESTCHECK
   monitoring project in jarrah forest of south-west Western Australia.
   Forty-eight monitoring grids were established across five locations
   within four jarrah forest ecosystems and were monitored over a 5-y
   period, with one location monitored each year. Silvicultural treatments
   (shelterwood/selective cut and gap release) were compared with reference
   forest that had never been harvested or had not been harvested for over
   40 y. A total of 318 species was recorded comprising 280 lichens, 27
   mosses, 10 liverworts and one hornwort. Seventy-two percent were
   identified to species level. There were strong regional influences
   (relating to different forest ecosystem types) observed in the
   composition of cryptogam communities. Silvicultural treatments
   significantly affected the species richness of lichens, which decreased
   with intensity of harvest, and the composition of the total cryptogam
   community. Total cryptogam species richness was lowest in
   silviculturally treated grids 1-4 y after treatment, but 10 or more
   years after treatment it was similar to that in reference grids
   prescribed-burnt 10 y or more previously. Species such as Sematophyllum
   subhumile var. contiguum (moss) and Cephaloziella exilifolia (liverwort)
   and several lichens were more frequent in reference forest than in
   silviculturally treated forest. Pannaparmelia wilsonii, Hypogymnia
   subphysodes and Tephromela alectoronica, two foliose and a crustose
   lichen associated with mature trees, were also recorded in the gap
   release treatment, demonstrating the importance of retained habitat
   trees for species other than native mammals and birds. One-half of all
   the cryptogams recorded used coarse woody debris as a substrate and 40\%
   of them depended on it entirely. Coarse woody debris is affected by both
   timber harvesting and fire, so there is a need to learn more regarding
   the specific requirements of saproxylic cryptogams in jarrah forest.}},

Volume = {{77}},

Pages = {{243-267}},
Abstract = {{The conilurine rodents, a predominantly Australian group of almost 50
   species, have suffered a higher rate of extinction and decline than
   other mammalian taxa. Previous theories advanced to explain mammal
   declines in Australia have not achieved wide acceptance or provided the
   confidence for initiation of general recovery programmes. This study
   examined univariate and multivariate associations between conilurine
   decline and a range of life history (body size, biogeographic province,
   habitat preference, diet, use of shelter and refuges, reproductive
   potential, population stability, and rainfall) and land-use parameters
   (abundance of the introduced fox Vulpes vulpes, cat Felis cattus, rabbit
   Oryctolagus cuniculus, and domestic stock). Life history associations
   included an increase in range decline with increasing body size; move
   severe decline in the avid centre and temperate woodlands; less severe
   decline in species which have high reproductive rates and those which
   use shelter (burrows and natural cavities); and a more severe decline in
   species with a high proportion of leaf/stem in their diets. Declines
   were most severe in areas where rabbits and foxes were abundant and less
   severe in areas where dingoes were abundant. The abundance of the cat
   was the best predictor of decline in small conilurines (<35 g), and in
   conilurines of all sizes where foxes and rabbits are scarce or absent.
   An `hyperpredation' hypothesis is advanced to account for these
   patterns. Declines have been most severe in areas where predator
   abundance (cat, fox, dingo Canis familiaris dingo) has been greatly
   elevated and sustained by the introduction of rabbits and mice. Cats and
   foxes ave also associated with severe declines in species with low
   reproductive rates in areas where rabbits and mice are scarce or absent
   and where habitats may have been modified by grazing or frequent
   burning. Rabbit control, construction of small predator-proof fenced
   enclosures around core breeding populations, and continued transfer of
   endangered fauna to predator-free islands ave advocated to facilitate
   conilurine recovery. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Title = {{The relative importance of tree and stand properties in susceptibility
   to spruce beetle outbreak in the mid-20th century}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Tree susceptibility to potentially lethal agents is determined not only
   by attributes of individual trees, but also by neighborhood effects at a
   range of scales. For example, effects of disturbances on individual
   trees are often contingent on the size, configuration, and other
   properties of neighboring trees. Wildfires can modify postfire
   properties of individual trees as well as of entire forest stands, both
   of which can affect subsequent ecological processes, including
   subsequent disturbances. In recent years, much has been learned about
   how disturbances interact, but numerous questions concerning underlying
   mechanisms remain unresolved. For example, the relative importance of
   forest properties at different spatial scales in determining how fires
   affect forest susceptibility to subsequent disturbances is not well
   understood. This study explicitly compares the relative importance of
   tree vs. fine-scale neighborhood effects (e.g., stand properties at < 7
   m radii), on susceptibility to a 1940s' spruce beetle outbreak.
   Attributes of individual trees and of stand structure were spatially
   reconstructed at five 250-m(2) sites that were partly burned in the late
   19th century and then affected by spruce beetle outbreak in the 1940s.
   Random Forest models and classification trees were used to compare the
   relative importance of variables for susceptibility to spruce beetle
   attack. Individual tree properties (diameter at breast height and age)
   were the most important predictors of susceptibility to the outbreak
   across all sites combined and at each of the sites individually. In
   contrast, neighborhood effects were poor predictors of susceptibility.
   This study suggests wildfires reduce susceptibility to outbreaks
   primarily by reducing the size of postfire live trees and only
   secondarily by modifying stand structure. One implication of this is
   that management strategies that aim to modify stand structure over large
   areas in order to reduce susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreaks may
   be unnecessarily intensive.}},

Abstract = {{Based on fossil organism remains including plant macrofossils, charcoal,
   pollen, and invertebrates preserved in syngenetic deposits of the
   Batagay permafrost sequence in the Siberian Yana Highlands, we
   reconstructed the environmental history during marine isotope stages
   (MIS) 6 to 2. Two fossil assemblages, exceptionally rich in plant
   remains, allowed for a detailed description of the palaeo-vegetation
   during two climate extremes of the Late Pleistocene, the onset of the
   last glacial maximum (LGM) and the last interglacial. In addition,
   altogether 41 assemblages were used to outline the vegetation history
   since the penultimate cold stage of MIS 6. Accordingly, meadow steppes
   analogue to modern communities of the phytosociological order
   Festucetalia lenensis formed the primary vegetation during the Saalian
   and Weichselian cold stages. Cold-resistant tundra-steppe communities
   (Carici rupestris-Kobresietea bellardii) as they occur above the
   treeline today were, in contrast to more northern locations, mostly
   lacking. During the last interglacial, open coniferous woodland similar
   to modern larch taiga was the primary vegetation at the site. Abundant
   charcoal indicates wildfire events during the last interglacial.
   Zoogenic disturbances of the local vegetation were indicated by the
   presence of ruderal plants, especially by abundant Urtica dioica,
   suggesting that the area was an interglacial refugium for large
   herbivores. Meadow steppes, which formed the primary vegetation during
   cold stages and provided potentially suitable pastures for herbivores,
   were a significant constituent of the plant cover in the Yana Highlands
   also under the full warm stage conditions of the last interglacial.
   Consequently, meadow steppes occurred in the Yana Highlands during the
   entire investigated timespan from MIS 6 to MIS 2 documenting a
   remarkable environmental stability. Thus, the proportion of meadow
   steppe vegetation merely shifted in response to the respectively
   prevailing climatic conditions. Their persistence indicates low
   precipitation and a relatively warm growing season throughout and beyond
   the late Pleistocene. The studied fossil record also proves that modern
   steppe occurrences in the Yana Highlands did not establish as late as in
   the Holocene but instead are relicts of a formerly continuous steppe
   belt extending from Central Siberia to Northeast Yakutia during the
   Pleistocene. The persistence of plants and invertebrates characteristic
   of meadow steppe vegetation in interior Yakutia throughout the late
   Quaternary indicates climatic continuity and documents the suitability
   of this region as a refugium also for other organisms of the Pleistocene
   mammoth steppe including the iconic large herbivores. (C)2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Reindeer and caribou are terrestrial herbivores, that feed on lichens
   and are used for commercial and subsistence food products. Caribou are a
   key component of the arctic food web and the bioaccumulation of toxic
   contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), needs to be monitored to establish a
   baseline as the arctic environment is impacted by both climate change
   and future industrial development. A changing climate in Alaska is
   influencing plant species composition, fire regime, melting and flooding
   events, and thus, impacting Hg bioavailability in the food chain.
   Industrial development in Asia is also projected to increase the
   atmospheric global pool of Hg from increased coal combustion. Reindeer,
   a domesticated representative of caribou, can be used as a terrestrial
   biomonitor for metal exposure. In this study total mercury
   concentrations were measured in lichens and in hair of grazing reindeer
   on defined, regarding Hg deposition. ranges across Alaska to establish a
   baseline for future hypothesis development and testing The Hg mean level
   for Seward Peninsula lichens on the Davis Range was 37.4 ng g(-1), on
   the Gray Range 47.1 ng g(-1), on the Kakaruk Range 42.2 ng g(-1), and
   41.7 ng g(-1) on the Noyakuk Range. Lichen Hg levels on St. Lawrence
   Island was 46.6 ng g(-1). Methyl mercury levels in lichens were found to
   be below detection levels. Reindeer grazing on these ranges had mean Hg
   hair levels of 14.6 ng g(-1) (Davis herd), 83.4 ng g(-1) (Gray herd),
   and 40.3 ng g(-1) (Noyakuk herd). Two reindeer on St. Lawrence Island
   had an average of Hg of 43.0 ng g(-1). Sample sizes ranged from n = 2 to
   n = 11. Hg mean levels in lichen on Seward Peninsula were higher than Hg
   means of two ranges in northern Mongolia. The Hg levels observed in this
   study indicate that Hg levels in Alaska are low at this time and pose no
   risk to the health of reindeer or human subsistence harvesters. A
   significant relationship between Hg in lichens on the ranges and the Hg
   in reindeer on those ranges has not been established. There are
   insufficient data on Hg levels in many areas of the north and more
   information is needed on location specific and time trends in Hg
   concentrations. Lichens and reindeer hair provide a good, non-invasive
   method of monitoring metal exposure changes in Alaskan ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{251-276}},
Abstract = {{Natural ecological disturbance creates habitats that are used by diverse
   groups of birds. In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include
   grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional
   forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has
   diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and
   development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and
   flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many
   bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as
   well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common
   than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats
   such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently
   reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in
   structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies
   involving the management of disturbance through some combination of
   flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of
   certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian
   habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale. Many aspects of
   the disturbance ecology of birds require further research. Important
   questions involve associations between the intensity and frequency of
   disturbance and the viability of bird populations, the scale of
   disturbance with respect to the spatial structure of populations, and
   the role of natural vs. anthropogenic disturbance. The effects of
   disturbance and ensuing successional processes on birds are potentially
   long-term, and comprehensive monitoring is essential.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{10-15}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The fire-dependent shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem that existed
   prior to European settlement is being restored on approximately 62,700
   ha in the Ouachita National Forest. The restoration effort's economic
   effects are not completely understood. This study will provide the
   Forest Service with a framework for better communicating the biological
   and economic impacts of future forest plans and amendments. It also
   seeks to provide information on how shortleaf pine responds to different
   management regimes and the implicit cost to maintain the endangered red
   cockaded woodpecker habitat, and the economic consequences of
   transitioning from the traditional management regime to a regime which
   restores the shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem. The paper suggests
   by adopting the new pine-bluestem management regime, timber harvests in
   the pine-bluestem area decline by 25\% during the 100-year simulation
   period, which will incur an additional implicit cost of \$72/ha/year to
   maintain the red cockaded woodpecker habitat. An implied value for each
   pair of woodpeckers amounts to either \$10,550 per year (for the desired
   400 total pairs) or \$16,880 per year (for the 250 reproducing pairs).
   Timber sale marking costs decline, while prescribed burning costs
   increase. The success of the pine-bluestem restoration requires the
   maintenance of a burning regime that prevents competing vegetation from
   occupying the middle canopy layer. Maintaining the pine-bluestem
   ecosystem will be difficult if environmental regulations become more
   stringent. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Forests provide direct protection to human settlements from
   hydrogeomorphic hazards. This paper proposes a method for assessing the
   effect of natural disturbances on the functionality of direct protection
   forests (DPFs) in order to prioritize management interventions. We
   georeferenced disturbance data for wildfires, wind and snow damage,
   avalanches, and insects and overlaid them to a region-wide DPF map.
   Within each disturbance polygon, we used a Landsat-5 TM image to
   identify DPFs with insufficient vegetation cover, by using a maximum
   likelihood classifier of 6 spectral bands plus 5 vegetation indices. For
   each disturbance agent, we fitted a generalized linear model of the
   probability of finding a forested pixel, as a function of topography,
   time since disturbance, distance from disturbance edge, summer
   precipitation, and drought in the disturbance year. DPFs covered almost
   half of total forest area in the study region. Disturbance by insects
   occurred in more than one sixth of all forests. Avalanche and wildfire
   occurred each in about one tenth of total forest area, and wind and snow
   disturbance in only 1\%. In the last 50 years, disturbances had a
   recurrence rate of 3\% every 10 years. Almost one sixth of DPFs are
   currently lacking sufficient forest cover. Wildfires resulted in the
   highest rate of nonforested pixels (42\% of all DPFs), followed by
   avalanches (21\%). Forest recovery was explained by time elapsed,
   distance from edge (for conifers), and aspect. Summer precipitation and
   drought had a mixed influence. Our approach to assessing the effect of
   disturbances on the functionality of DPFs is reproducible in all
   mountain regions using institutional or open-access geographic data and
   provides a tool to prioritize DPF management by indicating where
   restoration of protection is most urgent.}},

Abstract = {{Many large countries, including Canada, rely on earth observation as a
   practical and cost-effective means of monitoring their vast inland
   ecosystems. A potentially efficient approach is one that detects
   vegetation changes over a hierarchy of spatial scales ranging from
   coarse to fine. This paper presents a Change Screening Analysis
   Technique (Change-SAT) designed as a coarse filter to identify the
   location and timing of large (> 5-10 km(2)) forest cover changes caused
   by anthropogenic and natural disturbances at an annual, continental
   scale. The method uses change metrics derived from 1-km multi-temporal
   SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA AVHRR imagery (reflectance, temperature, and
   texture information) and ancillary spatial variables (proximity to
   active fires, roads, and forest tenures) in combination with logistic
   regression and decision tree classifiers. Major forest changes of
   interest include wildfires, insect defoliation, forest harvesting, and
   flooding. Change-SAT was tested for 1998-2000 using an independent
   sample of change and no-change sites over Canada. Overall accuracy was
   94\% and commission error, especially critical for large-area change
   applications, was less than 1\%. Regions identified as having major or
   widespread changes could be targeted for more detailed investigation and
   mapping using field visits, aerial survey, or fine resolution EO
   methods, such as those being applied under Canadian monitoring programs.
   This multi-resolution approach could be used as part of a forest
   monitoring system to report on carbon stocks and forest stewardship.

Abstract = {{In 1989 a wildfire destroyed 300 ha of natural pine forest and
   Mediterranean woodland on Mt. Carmel, Israel. Consequently an
   interdisciplinary scientific effort in fire ecology was initiated in
   order to propose recommendations to the management authorities, Field
   data gathered on soil erosion in the Mt. Carmel site implied that
   erosion is severe only during the first winter after fire, but it does
   not seem to present a significant threat to longterm ecosystem recovery.
   The recovery of the natural vegetation mitigates erosion, and there is
   no special need for any precautions to be taken immediatly following
   fire. Salvage cutting of burned trees had no effect on pine seedling
   recruitment, on vegetation development and on plant species diversity.
   Salvage cutting did affect passerine bird community by slowing down
   succession rate. For successful regeneration of the pine forest the
   burned site need not to be planted, since the number of natural pine
   seedlings is sufficiently great, and there is a need to conserve the
   genetic and spatial variability of the forest. Although thinning has a
   positive effect on short-term pine survival and growth, such action is
   not recommended since pine seedlings are susceptible to pine bast scale
   (Matsococcus josephi) up to seven years, and to severe damage by
   porcupines. Selection caused by this bast scale might improve the
   resistance of the new pine forest stand. Pine seedling growing in
   the:microsites of the old burned pine trees should be treated carefully,
   since some of them, due to their fast development, appear to be the next
   generation of the forest. Thinning of these groups can be considered
   after seven years, accompanied by removal of Cistus dwarf shrubs.
   However, where porcupine damage is observed, thinning should be done at
   low rates and with no pruning of side twigs. Since animal succession is
   a consequence of the change and progress in vegetation structure, there
   is no need for animal resettlement. The concept of ``fuel breaks{''},
   combining a single massive thinning of the woody vegetation and an
   annual short but heavy grazing, is a management option for decreasing
   fire danger and future fire damage.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With a surface area of nearly 1,800 square kilometers, Lake Okeechobee
   is a prominent central feature of the South Florida aquatic ecosystem.
   The lake provides regional flood protection, supports a prized
   recreational fishery, provides habitat for migratory waterfowl and
   regional wading bird populations, and is a source of fresh water for
   irrigation, drinking, and restoration of downstream ecosystems. The main
   stressors on Lake Okeechobee are (1) large inputs of phosphorus from
   agricultural and other anthropogenic land uses in the watershed, (2)
   unnatural variation in water levels due to channelization of inflows and
   dike containment, and (3) rapid expansion of non-native plants.
   Ecological effects are complicated due to three distinct in-lake zones
   with different water chemistry, physical properties, and biota. A
   central pelagic zone has turbid, nutrient-rich water and phytoplankton
   dominance; a shallow south and western near-shore zone has submerged
   plant or phytoplankton dominance (at low vs. high water levels,
   respectively); and a western littoral zone is dominated by emergent
   wetland plants. Changes in water level influence the flow of nutrients
   between zones, thereby creating a synergistic effect between stressors.
   Under high water conditions, there is considerable advective transport
   of nutrients from the pelagic zone into the littoral zone. Under low
   water conditions, the littoral zone is cut off hydrologically and is a
   rainfall-driven oligotrophic wetland. Low water also facilitates drying
   and wildfires in the littoral zone, which in turn has an influence on
   expansion of non-native plants and recovery of native plants from buried
   seed banks. All of these factors influence fish, wading birds, and other
   animals, which depend on littoral and near-shore plant communities for
   nesting and foraging habitat. This paper describes our current knowledge
   of these complex processes, the lake's expected responses to ongoing and
   planned restoration programs, and key areas of uncertainty requiring
   future research.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Abstract = {{Degraded grasslands are common worldwide, often due to overgrazing by
   livestock; such degradation often reduces plant growth and water
   quality, while increasing soil erosion, wildfires, and invasive species.
   Recent restoration efforts have used organic amendments to increase soil
   nutrients, improve water retention, and increase forage production.
   Biosolids, the stabilised and pathogen-treated remains from wastewater
   treatment plants, have strong impacts on soil nutrients and plant
   growth, but there is very little known about impacts on higher trophic
   levels. We worked on northern grasslands in British Columbia, Canada, to
   test whether biosolids applications changed grasshopper abundances, body
   sizes, or species richness. We used hoop transects to measure density
   and timed net samples to determine richness and evenness. There were
   significantly higher (similar to 3.8 ) grasshopper densities at sites
   where biosolids were applied 1-2 years before sampling compared with
   control sites or sites where biosolids were applied in the year of
   sampling. Tibia lengths of grasshoppers varied with treatment, species,
   and sex, but there was no clear signature of biosolids leading to bigger
   body sizes. There were no significant differences in species richness or
   equitability in relation to the year of the biosolids application.
   Collectively, our results show that biosolids have large impacts on
   grasshopper densities, but no clear impact on community structure or
   body size. Because grasshoppers can be dominant insect herbivores and
   are critical prey for many birds and mammals, our results suggest
   biosolids could be an important tool in the context of site restoration
   or efforts to improve populations of insectivorous vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat quality reduced by fire suppression may have influenced the
   recent decline of Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium). A major
   foraging habitat for Key deer, the rockland pine community, as well as
   several plants endemic to this habitat, depend on periodic fires for
   continued existence. Refuge burning is opposed by residents of nearby
   urban development. To quantify effects of fire, we measured use and
   nutritive content of browse for the year following fire, monitored
   growth of the vegetation after fire, and documented succession in
   relation to time since the last fire. Browsing by deer was most intense
   early in the growing season. Deer chose species high in crude protein
   (CP), phosphorus (P), and in vitro digestibility (IVOMD). The 2 most
   heavily browsed pineland species, blackbead (Pithecellobium keyense) and
   Indian mulberry (Morinda royoc), were high in CP year-round. The amount
   of P of diet species was lower than the assumed requirement for deer but
   actually may be adequate. Increases in nutritive value in important
   dietary species lasted 6-11 months after burning. Sprout density of
   species in the diet was higher (P < 0.05) in burned than in unburned
   plots, providing more browse within 2 years after burning. Fruiting of
   diet species returned to unburned levels within 1 year after burning at
   most sites. Thus, burning of pineland provided temporary benefits in
   nutritive quality and more prolonged benefits in browse quantity. Fire's
   retardation of succession, however, may be of greater benefit to deer
   than temporary forage enhancement. Community structure was similar among
   pine stands on Big Pine Key. Vegetation on smaller islands was a mixture
   of pineland and hammock species, with few herbaceous species, including
   those important in the Key deer diet. A 10- to 20-year interval between
   fires maintains pine savanna on Big Pine Key. An interval of 10-50 years
   on smaller, more isolated islands arrests succession at an intermediate
   stage. Only a very long fire-free interval (>100 years) allows full
   development of a hammock community. Endemic herbaceous plants at
   pineland sites were generally unaffected by fire in pine savanna,
   whereas they were rare or absent from sites in which succession had
   advanced to mixed pine-hammock composition. Preventing extinction of
   endemic plants is a major benefit of prescribed burning. Despite the
   value of prescribed burning for maintaining pineland endemics and
   species important in the Key deer diet, management of Lower Keys
   vegetation should encompass other successional stages. Maintaining a
   diversity of stands will provide cover for deer and refuge for numerous
   plant species intolerant of burning. We recommend an experimental regime
   of replicated plots of pine savanna be burned at 5-, 15-, 25-, and
   75-year intervals to document responses of plant species as well as
   successional shifts.}},

Abstract = {{Pitfall trapping was used in commercial Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus
   regnans) regrowth forest to study the effects on epigeal arthropods of
   high-intensity wildfire plus salvage logging, and of harvesting by
   clearfelling plus slash burning, followed by fire-induced natural or
   artificially established regeneration respectively.  The study, the
   first of its kind in the Victorian Central Highlands, 60 km east of
   Melbourne, was based on 146 922 specimens of 30 ordinal or lower level
   taxa collected over a 3-year period.  The abrupt replacement of the
   ecologically complex regrowth forest by ecologically much simpler
   even-aged regeneration caused appreciable instability among the
   litter-frequenting arthropods.  An immediate decline in diversity
   occurred due to short-term boosts in activity of some common `major'
   taxa (notably a species of seed-harvesting ant) and the suppression of
   other taxa.  A broad mix of functionally diverse taxa reappeared within
   two years of regeneration, and all but three rarely trapped `minor' taxa
   present in undisturbed 43-46 year old regrowth ('control') forest had
   returned within 5 years.  Epigeal arthropods therefore appeared to be
   affected only over a short period relative to the nominal 80-150 year
   rotation of the E. regnans ecosystem.  Research is needed at the species
   level to achieve a more precise assessment of arthropod responses to
   major ecological disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is gradual and long-term, consistently collected data are
   required to detect resulting biological responses and to separate such
   responses from local effects of human activities that monitoring
   programs usually are designed to assess. The reference-condition
   approach is commonly used in freshwater assessments that use predictive
   modeling, but a consistent reference condition is required to maintain
   the relevance and integrity of results over the long term. We
   investigated whether external influences, such as climate change,
   inhibited clear interpretation of bioassessment results in a study
   design using reference vs test sites. Macroinvertebrates were collected
   from 16 sites (11 sites affected by ski resorts and 5 reference sites)
   on 5 streams in 4 seasons each year from 1994 to 2008 within Kosciuszko
   National Park, Australia. We analyzed trends over 15 y to address
   questions regarding climate-change and macroinvertebrate bioindicators
   of stream condition (observed/expected {[}O/E] taxa; Stream Invertebrate
   Grade Number Average Level {[}SIGNAL] 2 scores; Simpson's Diversity;
   Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera {[}EPT] richness ratio; and
   Oligochaeta abundance). Climate became slightly warmer and less humid (p
   < 0.0001), but no significant relationships between climate variables
   and bioindicators were evident. All bioindicators consistently
   distinguished between test and reference sites in all seasons. All
   bioindicators except for O/E taxa scores differed among streams
   (regardless of site type). O/E taxa are inherently adjusted for specific
   stream characteristics, and, thus, were robust to differences in stream
   type while remaining sensitive to reference and test site variation.
   Generally, reference and test sites did not respond differently to any
   gradual climate changes. Furthermore, the reference sites sampled
   through time remained in a condition equivalent to the previously
   defined reference condition and provided a valid comparison for current
   test sites of unknown condition. The bioindicators used here were
   insensitive to the small but significant changes in climate detected
   over the 15-y study. However, extreme climate-related events (such as
   severe drought and extensive bushfire) were detected by the chosen
   bioindicators at both reference and test sites. Ecological outcomes of
   climate change can be accounted for only by an appropriate study design
   that includes standardized sampling of fixed sites (both test and
   reference) over long periods.}},

Abstract = {{The gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus Daudin, is endemic to the
   southeastern US, where its populations are declining primarily due to
   habitat destruction. Tortoises are preyed upon by many species,
   including the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, a
   destructive exotic species now common throughout the tortoises' entire
   range. We surveyed ants using tuna bait at 154 G. polyphemus burrows in
   a greenway reserve established to protect the tortoises in a residential
   area of southeast Florida. We found S. invicta present, typically
   recruiting to the bait in very high numbers, oil the aprons of 33\% of
   the tortoise burrows. Solenopsis invicta occurred significantly more
   often at burrows within 30 m of the greenway's outer edge than at
   burrows in more interior parts of the greenway (57\% versus 16\%). Among
   the interior burrows, S. invicta occurred significantly more often at
   burrows directly on two narrow strips of disturbed habitat, along all
   old fence line and an old pipeline, than at burrows not on these two
   strips (46\% versus 12\%). The greenway interior appears to offer
   tortoises and other species some refuge from S. invicta. However, the
   long thin design typical of greenways, the inclusion of walking paths
   through the greenways, and the policies of prescribed burning and
   reduction mowing used to maintain open habitat for the tortoises all may
   increase the tortoises' exposure to S. invicta. Solenopsis invicta is
   also a grave threat to other native species in these reserves, including
   the many animals that obligately live inside gopher tortoise burrows.}},

Abstract = {{Natural compounds extracted from marine organisms consisting of

   Kutumskin and shell waste of shrimp, respectively, using acid-base
   method. SDS-PAGE was performed to determine subunit composition of
   collagen. After amino acid analysis using HPLC, different ratios of
   collagen and chitosan mixture (Col-CH, 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) were prepared
   to fine the most effective of Col-CH gel on burn wound healing and
   compare to animals treated with silver sulfadiazine ointment. Wound
   surface area was analyzed using ImageJ software on days 15 and 30. H\&E
   staining was performed to show the epithelialization, collagen
   deposition, fibroblast cell accumulation and vessel formation on days 15
   and 30. The results from H\&E were scored and quantified by pathologist.
   SDS-PAGE technique revealed that extracted-collagen was type 1 composed
   of two alpha (alpha(1)and alpha(2)) chains. HPLC showed that Glycine was
   the most abundant amino acid which included one-third of total amino
   acid in the skin. The wound surface measurement showed a significant
   reduction in wound size in animals treated with Col-CH (1:1) compared to
   silver sulfadiazine treated group at day 25. Histopathological findings
   represented high score in epithelialization, vessel formation and a
   decrease in inflammatory cells infiltration in Col-CH (1:1) treated

Title = {{Soil Erosion Risk Assessment in Uganda}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Land use without adequate soil erosion control measures is continuously
   increasing the risk of soil erosion by water mainly in developing
   tropical countries. These countries are prone to environmental
   disturbance due to high population growth and high rainfall intensity.
   The aim of this study is to assess the state of soil erosion by water in
   Uganda at national and district levels, for various land cover and land
   use (LCLU) types, in protected areas as well to predict the impact of
   support practices on soil loss reduction. Predictions obtained using the
   Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model indicated that the
   mean rate of soil loss risk in Uganda's erosion-prone lands was 3.2
   t.ha(-1).y(-1), resulting in a total annual soil loss of about 62
   million tons in 2014. About 39\% of the country's erosion-prone lands
   were comprised of unsustainable mean soil loss rates > 1 t.ha(-1).y(-1).
   Out of 112 districts in Uganda, 66 districts were found to have
   unsustainable estimated soil loss rates > 1 t.ha(-1).y(-1). Six
   districts in Uganda were found to have mean annual soil loss rates of >
   10 t.ha(-1).y(-1): Bududa (46.3 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Kasese (37.5
   t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Bundibugyo (28.9 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Bulambuli (20.9
   t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Sironko (14.6 t.ha(-1).y(-1)) and Kotido (12.5
   t.ha(-1).y(-1)). Among the LCLU types, the highest soil loss rates of 11
   t.ha(-1).y(-1) and 10.6 t.ha(-1).y(-1) were found in moderate natural
   forest and dense natural forest, respectively, mainly due to their
   locations in highland areas characterized by steep slopes ranging
   between 16\% to 21\% and their high rainfall intensity, ranging from
   1255 mm.y(-1) to 1292 mm.y(-1). Only five protected areas in Uganda were
   found to have high mean estimated mean soil loss rates > 10
   t.ha(-1).y(-1): Rwenzori Mountains (142.94 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Mount Elgon
   (33.81 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), Bokora corridor (12.13 t.ha(-1).y(-1)),
   Matheniko (10.39 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), and Nangolibwel (10.33
   t.ha(-1).y(-1)). To manage soil erosion in Uganda's protected areas,
   there is an urgent need to control wildfires and human-induced
   disturbances such as timber harvesting and soil compaction from domestic
   animals. Our study analysis revealed that well-established terraces and
   strip-cropping could significantly reduce soil loss rates in Uganda's
   croplands by 80\% (from 1.5 t.ha(-1).y(-1) to 0.3 t.ha(-1).y(-1)) and by
   47\% (from 1.5 t.ha(-1).y(-1) to 0.8 t.ha(-1).y(-1)), respectively, well
   below the sustainable soil erosion tolerance rate (1 t.ha(-1).y(-1)) for
   land and water conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Annual grass invasion and dominance creates a
   self-sustaining cycle that promotes wildfires and reduces forage
   abundance. Restoring native plant species to annual grass-invaded
   ecosystems is fundamental to fostering self-sustaining native plant
   communities. Aims: We sought to clarify varying restoration strategies
   on invasive annual and native perennial grass assembly, including
   strategically modified seeding times, seeding rates, and added water.
   Methods: We tested the effects of seeding perennial grasses in autumn,
   spring, or seeding half in autumn and the remaining half in spring,
   adding water, and varying annual and perennial grass seeding rates on
   annual and perennial grass life history. Results: While varying
   perennial grass seeding times did not affect perennial grass germination
   rates, annual grass germination rates were highest when perennial
   grasses were seeded in autumn. Seeding perennial grasses in spring
   produced the highest adult perennial grass density in the first-growing
   season, but adult perennial grass density in the second-growing season
   was greatest when seeding occurred in autumn. Second-growing season
   perennial grass density was highest where annual grass seeding rates
   were lowest and perennial grass seeding rates were highest. Adding water
   in the first-growing season produced almost two-times more second-year
   adult perennial grasses compared to where water was not added.
   Conclusions: High water availability during the seeding year appears to
   be the most important factor for retaining perennial grasses in annual
   grass-invaded ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{A randomized complete block experiment was performed to measure the
   effect of prescribed, dormant-season bums of three different levels of
   severity (measured as fuel consumption and soil surface heating) on
   subsequent insect infestation and mortality of mature longleaf pine
   (Pinus palustris Mill.). Multiple-funnel traps baited with a low release
   rate of turpentine and ethanol were used to monitor activity of certain
   coniferophagous beetles. Non-aggressive species, including the root
   beetles Hylastes salebrosus Eichhoff and H. tenuis Eichhoff, the
   ambrosia beetle Xyleborus pubescens Zimmermann, the reproduction weevil
   Pachylobius picivorus (Germar), and buprestid borers, were attracted to
   burned plots in numbers that correlated positively with burn severity.
   Beetle attraction to burned sites was greatest in the first weeks
   post-burn and disappeared by the second year. Two potential tree-killing
   bark beetles, Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) and Ips grandicollis
   (Eichhoff), were trapped in significant numbers but exhibited no
   attraction to burned plots. Tree mortality correlated significantly with
   the severity of the burns and amounted to 5\% of stems in the hottest
   burn treatment after 3 years. The majority of the mortality was observed
   in the second and third years post-burn. Attacks of Ips and Dendroctonus
   bark beetles were apparent on nearly all dead or dying trees, and
   evidence suggested that root pathogens may have contributed to tree
   susceptibility to beetle attack and mortality. Our data indicate that
   selection of burn regimes that reduce or eliminate consumption of duff
   (e.g., favoring heading fires over backing fires) could significantly
   reduce mortality of longleaf pine managed for long rotations. Published

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The structure and function of Alaska's forests have changed
   significantly in response to a changing climate, including alterations
   in species composition and climate feedbacks (e. g., carbon, radiation
   budgets) that have important regional societal consequences and human
   feedbacks to forest ecosystems. In this paper we present the first
   comprehensive synthesis of climate-change impacts on all forested
   ecosystems of Alaska, highlighting changes in the most critical
   biophysical factors of each region. We developed a conceptual framework
   describing climate drivers, biophysical factors and types of change to
   illustrate how the biophysical and social subsystems of Alaskan forests
   interact and respond directly and indirectly to a changing climate. We
   then identify the regional and global implications to the climate system
   and associated socio-economic impacts, as presented in the current
   literature. Projections of temperature and precipitation suggest
   wildfire will continue to be the dominant biophysical factor in the
   Interior-boreal forest, leading to shifts from conifer-to
   deciduous-dominated forests. Based on existing research, projected
   increases in temperature in the Southcentral- and Kenai-boreal forests
   will likely increase the frequency and severity of insect outbreaks and
   associated wildfires, and increase the probability of establishment by
   invasive plant species. In the Coastal-temperate forest region snow and
   ice is regarded as the dominant biophysical factor. With continued
   warming, hydrologic changes related to more rapidly melting glaciers and
   rising elevation of the winter snowline will alter discharge in many
   rivers, which will have important consequences for terrestrial and
   marine ecosystem productivity. These climate-related changes will affect
   plant species distribution and wildlife habitat, which have regional
   societal consequences, and trace-gas emissions and radiation budgets,
   which are globally important. Our conceptual framework facilitates
   assessment of current and future consequences of a changing climate,
   emphasizes regional differences in biophysical factors, and points to
   linkages that may exist but that currently lack supporting research. The
   framework also serves as a visual tool for resource managers and policy
   makers to develop regional and global management strategies and to
   inform policies related to climate mitigation and adaptation.}},

   Traditional Ecological Knowledge}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Sustainability science promotes place-based resource management because
   natural processes vary among ecosystems. When local science is limited,
   land managers may be forced to generalize from other ecosystems that
   function differently. One proposed solution is to draw upon the
   traditional ecological knowledge that indigenous groups have accumulated
   through resource use. Integrating traditional ecological knowledge with
   conventional resource management is difficult, especially when the two
   offer competing explanations of local environments. Although resource
   managers may discount traditional ecological knowledge that contradicts
   conventional resource management, we investigate the possibility that
   these disagreements can arise when nonlocal resource management
   generalizations displace place-based science. Specifically, we compare
   claims about wildfires made by Athabascan forest users residing in or
   near the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge and in the U.S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service fire management plan for that refuge. We focus on two
   aspects of fire ecology and management: the drivers of landscape
   flammability and the feasibility of using wildfires and prescribed burns
   to achieve resource management objectives. The results indicated that
   some disagreements came from reliance of the federal fire management
   plan on generalized national narratives at the expense of place-based
   science. We propose that in some cases, conflicts between traditional
   ecological knowledge and conventional resource management, rather than
   indicating a dead end, can identify topics requiring in-depth,
   place-based research.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a habitat quality index based on Auchenorrhyncha (Insecta:
   Hemiptera) species composition was used to investigate the index's
   ability in discriminating hill prairie quality along a gradient of
   disturbance, based on the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory grading
   criteria; whether this index differs from other vegetation-based
   measures of quality; and examine the relationships between
   Auchenorrhyncha and vegetation integrity and diversity. Auchenorrhyncha
   and vascular plants were sampled from 14 Illinois glacial-drift hill
   prairies representing a range in quality. Insects and plants were
   sampled from late July through August, 2007 and analyzed using
   univariate and multivariate analyses. Results from this study showed
   that Floristic Quality Index, Auchenorrhyncha Quality Index, as well as
   other Auchenorrhyncha and plant diversity and integrity index values are
   greater in high, followed by mid, then low quality hill prairie
   remnants. Also, these analyses showed that perennial C4 grasses are
   strongly associated with prairie Auchenorrhyncha. These data suggest
   that judicious used of prescribed burning or brush removal may be needed
   to prevent woody-encroachment from eliminating prairie vegetation and
   Auchenorrhyncha on low quality sites; and restoration of perennial C4
   grasses on low quality sites are needed to support more prairie
   Auchenorrhyncha fauna. Reintroductions of conservative (i.e.,
   prairie-dependent and fire-sensitive) Auchenorrhyncha may also be needed
   to improve Auchenorrhyncha integrity on mid and low quality sites but
   these reintroductions need to be used in combination with reduced burn
   management or the inclusion of unburned refugia to reduce the
   extirpation of these fire-sensitive insects.}},

Abstract = {{Soil degradation in India is estimated to be occurring on 147 million
   hectares (Mha) of land, including 94 Mha from water erosion, 16 Mha from
   acidification, 14 Mha from flooding, 9 Mha from wind erosion, 6 Mha from
   salinity, and 7 Mha from a combination of factors. This is extremely
   serious because India supports 18\% of the world's human population and
   15\% of the world's livestock population, but has only 2.4\% of the
   world's land area. Despite its low proportional land area, India ranks
   second worldwide in farm output. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries
   account for 17\% of the gross domestic product and employs about 50\% of
   the total workforce of the country. Causes of soil degradation are both
   natural and human-induced. Natural causes include earthquakes, tsunamis,
   droughts, avalanches, landslides, volcanic eruptions, floods, tornadoes,
   and wildfires. Human-induced soil degradation results from land clearing
   and deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper
   management of industrial effluents and wastes, over-grazing, careless
   management of forests, surface mining, urban sprawl, and
   commercial/industrial development. Inappropriate agricultural practices
   include excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, excessive and
   unbalanced use of inorganic fertilizers, poor irrigation and water
   management techniques, pesticide overuse, inadequate crop residue and/or
   organic carbon inputs, and poor crop cycle planning. Some underlying
   social causes of soil degradation in India are land shortage, decline in
   per capita land availability, economic pressure on land, land tenancy,
   poverty, and population increase. In this review of land degradation in
   India, we summarize (1) the main causes of soil degradation in different
   agro-climatic regions; (2) research results documenting both soil
   degradation and soil health improvement in various agricultural systems;
   and (3) potential solutions to improve soil health in different regions
   using a variety of conservation agricultural approaches.}},

Title = {{Temporal changes in bird communities of wind-affected coniferous
   mountain forest in differently disturbed stands (High Tatra Mts.,
   Slovakia)}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGIA}},
Abstract = {{In November 2004 a large windstorm affected forests dominated by Norway
   spruce (Picea abies(L.) H. Karst, 1881) in the High Tatras National
   Park, Slovakia, and was followed by a wildfire (2005) and bark beetle
   outbreak. In this study we investigate temporal changes of breeding bird
   community (their species richness, density and diversity) as well as
   different nest-position guilds, in relation to disturbance type. Bird
   species composition was surveyed in two periods (2006 and 2007, and 2017
   and 2018) using the point count method on four plots differing by
   disturbance type - undisturbed forest, unlogged windthrow, salvage
   logged windthrow and burnt salvage logged windthrow. A total of three
   visits per point and breeding season were performed at forty point count
   sites. We also assessed the successional shift in habitat
   characteristics between the two monitored periods. In total, 55 bird
   species and 2059 individuals were recorded on the plots during the
   study. We observed no effect of disturbance type on mean species
   richness, abundance and Simpson's diversity per point; however, those
   characteristics did significantly increase over the study duration.
   While differently disturbed points had previously differed in their
   (nest-position) guild number and diversity, the differences between them
   disappeared over time. We found different trajectories of temporal
   change in the composition of the species communities and guild diversity
   in relation to disturbance type, but in a similar direction. During the
   first period, the greater the initial differences in the severity of
   disturbance among the disturbance types, the greater the differences
   were in the composition of bird communities; however, the differences
   gradually diminished as the forests regenerated. Alterations in habitat
   structure caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbance and by
   subsequent succession were the most probable reasons for the altered
   bird communities and observed patterns of recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The montane forests of the Central Highlands, Victoria, are managed for
   multiple uses that include biodiversity conservation acid timber
   harvesting. Old-growth communities within mountain ash forest have been
   shown to support a range of fauna. These communities have a restricted
   distribution, as a result of combined effects of previous wildfires and
   timber harvesting. Patches of mountain ash old-growth forest vary in
   size, shape, topographic position, structure, and isolation from other
   patches. The study investigated effects of this spatial patterning on
   selected fauna that require old trees. Arboreal marsupials were used to
   measure these effects, focusing on the yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus
   australis) and the greater glider (Petauroides volans). Forty-nine
   old-growth forest sites were surveyed for gliders using spotlight
   transects and owl-call playback, and for a variety of landscape and
   habitat variables. Occurrence of the greater glider was significantly
   related to overstorey basal area (P < 0.001). An alternative model found
   greater glider occurrence to be significantly related to old-growth
   patch size (P = 0.004). The probability of yellow-bellied glider
   occurrence was highest at sites located in large patches of old-growth
   forest (P = 0.03). These results appear to be related to the foraging
   requirements and population biology of the yellow-bellied glider and
   shelter requirements of the greater glider. The abundance of greater
   gliders at a site was also found to be significantly related to
   overstorey basal area (P < 0.001). The size and quality of old-growth
   forest patches (quality measured by overstorey basal area) were shown to
   influence their value for fauna conservation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Sex steroids and glucocorticoid ratios in Iberian lynx hair}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge on species' reproductive biology is a fundamental
   pre-requisite of every conservation effort, but is often lacking. Sex
   steroids can provide valuable information for the assessment of
   reproductive success, whereas glucocorticoids are used to assess
   adrenocortical activity and stress-related bodily adaption. However, due
   to their perilous condition, access to animals is often difficult, which
   makes hormone measurement in non-invasively collected hair samples an
   attractive option. We determined cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone,
   testosterone and progesterone in Iberian lynx hair using enzyme
   immunoassay (EIA). Cross-validation was performed with high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography
   coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Finally, we
   statistically evaluated the variations of sex steroids and
   glucocorticoids according to age, sex, origin, behavior and management.
   All steroids except corticosterone were detectable in Iberian lynx hair.
   Hair progesterone measured by EIA was overestimated by cross-reaction
   with 5 alpha-tdihydroprogesterone, a biologically active gestagene, and
   was highly correlated with HPLC-MS/MS results. Progesterone was higher
   in adult females compared to all other age-sex groups. Cortisol measured
   by EIA was overestimated due to antibody cross-reactivity with cortisone
   and was correlated to the sum of HPLC-MS/MS measurements for cortisol
   and cortisone. Cortisol was higher in females than in males measured by
   HPLC-MS/MS, but the EIA results were confounded by the lack of
   specificity. When using cortisol-cortisone and
   cortisol-dihydroepiandrosterone ratios, differences were noted between
   wild-caught and captive-bred lynxes. Additionally, longitudinal EIA
   measurements of an Iberian lynx after a wildfire showed an inversion of
   the cortisol-cortisone ratio that later subsided. These results validate
   the use of hair progesterone measurement for Iberian lynx reproductive
   monitoring and add to the growing evidence supporting the need for a
   more comprehensive approach to hair steroid measurement that accounts
   for local interconversion and co-regulation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus Free.) (Lepidoptera:
   Tortricidae) is a native insect that periodically defoliates areas of
   jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) in the subboreal forests of North
   America east of the Rocky Mountains. Outbreaks of jack pine budworm
   generally occur at 6- to 12-year intervals and collapse after 2-4 years.
   Periodicity of outbreaks varies and is associated with site-related
   factors. Survival of early-instar larvae during spring dispersal is tied
   to the abundance of pollen cones (microsporangiate strobili), which
   provide a refuge for larvae until current-year needles expand. Jack pine
   trees that have been heavily defoliated produce few pollen cones in the
   following year, often resulting in high mortality of early-stage larvae.
   A diverse guild of generalist parasitoids attack jack pine budworm, but
   only a few species account for most mortality in any area. Collapsing
   jack pine budworm populations are characterized by sharp declines in
   early instar survival, coupled with an increased rate of parasitism in
   the late larval and pupal stages. The reciprocal interaction between
   heavy defoliation and low pollen cone production, and increased
   parasitism of late-stage larvae or pupae. are consistent with
   second-order density dependence factors identified in analysis of a
   long-term population data set. Since the 1950s, several jack pine
   budworm outbreaks have been roughly synchronous over a large geographic
   areal suggesting that Moran effect processes, as well as moth dispersal
   or other factors, may be involved in jack pine budworm dynamics.
   Although the short duration of outbreaks enables most trees to recover,
   over time dead trees and top-killed trees accumulate in jack pine
   stands. Jack pine is well adapted to fire and when fires ignite, the
   accumulation of dead trees and woody debris often leads to intense
   wildfires followed by prolific regeneration. The three-way interaction
   of jack pine, jack pine budworm. and fire ultimately serves to maintain
   vigorous stands and ensures continued hosts for jack pine budworm.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{362}},

Abstract = {{Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is the most widespread tree species
   in North America and has supported a unique ecosystem for tens of
   thousands of years, yet is currently threatened by dramatic loss and
   possible local extinctions. While multiple factors such as climate
   change and fire suppression are thought to contribute to aspen's
   decline, increased browsing by elk (Cervus elaphus), which have
   experienced dramatic population increases in the last similar to 80
   years, may severely inhibit aspen growth and regeneration. Fires are
   known to favor aspen recovery, but in the last several decades the
   spatial scale and intensity of wildfires has greatly increased, with
   poorly understood ramifications for aspen growth. Here, focusing on the
   2000 Cerro Grande fire in central New Mexico - one of the earliest fires
   described as a ``mega-fire{''} - we use three methods to examine the
   impact of elk browsing on aspen regeneration after a mega-fire. First,
   we use an exclosure experiment to show that aspen growing in the absence
   of elk were 3x taller than trees growing in the presence of elk.
   Further, aspen that were both protected from elk and experienced burning
   were 8.5 x taller than unburned trees growing in the presence of elk,
   suggesting that the combination of release from herbivores and
   stimulation from fire creates the largest aspen growth rates. Second,
   using surveys at the landscape level, we found a correlation between elk
   browsing intensity and aspen height, such that where elk browsing was
   highest, aspen were shortest. This relationship between elk browsing
   intensity and aspen height was stronger in burned (r = -0.53) compared
   to unburned (r = -0.24) areas. Third, in conjunction with the
   landscape-level surveys, we identified possible natural refugia,
   microsites containing downed logs, shrubs etc. that may inhibit elk
   browsing by physically blocking aspen from elk or by impeding elk's
   ability to move through the forest patch. We did not find any consistent
   patterns between refuge elements and aspen size or canopy cover
   suggesting that natural refugia are not aiding in aspen recruitment and
   that all young aspen were susceptible to browsing. In much of their
   normal range, aspen are not growing to large size classes, which
   threatens the future of this iconic species and calls into question the
   ability of ecosystems to recover from mega-fires. Our results highlight
   the importance of considering multiple interacting factors (i.e. fire
   and increased elk browsing) when considering aspen management and
   regeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Site occupancy of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in response to
   salvage logging in the boreal forest}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{451}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{As a consequence of warmer winters, the frequency and severity of bark
   beetle infestations has increased in western North America, creating
   controversy over how to manage beetle-killed forests. Post-infestation
   salvage logging is increasingly used to reduce wildfire risk and recover
   the value of beetle-killed trees; however, the ecological consequences
   of this practice-are-poorly understood. We investigated the effects of
   post-infestation salvage logging in the boreal forest (Yukon, Canada) on
   habitat use by the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), a
   forest-dwelling species that is relatively tolerant of vegetative
   clutter and numerically dominant in boreal bat communities. We
   hypothesized that little brown bats would select closed-canopied sites,
   particularly at high latitudes where bats may be vulnerable to predators
   during midsummer when daylight is nearly continuous. Thus, we expected
   low occupancy rates in salvage-logged stands, particularly those with
   low tree retention. Because night length increases drastically after
   summer solstice, we also predicted that bat preference for closed
   canopies would decline by late summer. We monitored for bat presence
   with ultrasound detectors in 30 unlogged, beetle-affected stands and 60
   small ( < 30 ha) salvage-logged stands of variable retention. We used
   occupancy models to test predictions regarding bat response to logging
   and associated changes in forest structure at local and landscape
   scales. Contrary to our predictions, occupancy by little brown bats was
   generally higher in salvage-logged stands, although differences were not
   statistically significant. Bat occupancy declined with increasing tree
   basal area, particularly during the second half of the summer when bats
   avoided forest stands with basal area > 40 m(2)/ha. Our results suggest
   that vegetative clutter was a primary constraint for little brown bats.
   The observed clutter avoidance in late summer may have been caused by
   the presence of newly volant juveniles, which are not yet proficient at
   flying in clutter. In addition, bats may have shifted their preference
   to open habitats during late summer when nights were longer and darker,
   and perceived predation risk was likely reduced. Our study suggests that
   small patches of salvage-logged boreal forest may improve foraging
   habitat for little brown bats through clutter reduction; however, we
   caution that interpretation of our results should be limited to the tree
   retention levels and scale of logging at our sites. Additionally, the
   potential importance of unlogged areas as roosting habitat requires
   consideration before prescriptions are made on the proportion of the
   landscape to be salvage-logged.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses an ongoing effort to develop new geospatial
   information products for aiding coastal forest restoration and
   conservation efforts in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi. This project
   employs Landsat, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
   Radiometer (ASTER), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) satellite data in conjunction with airborne elevation data to
   compute coastal forest cover type maps and change detection products.
   Improved forest mapping products are needed to aid coastal forest
   restoration and management efforts of State and Federal agencies in the
   Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) region. In particular, such products may
   aid coastal forest land acquisition and conservation easement
   procurements. This region's forests are often disturbed and subjected to
   multiple biotic and abiotic threats, including subsidence, salt water
   intrusion, hurricanes, sea-level rise, insect-induced defoliation and
   mortality, altered hydrology, wildfire, and conversion to non-forest
   land use. In some cases, such forest disturbance has led to forest loss
   or loss of regeneration capacity. In response, a case study was
   conducted to assess and demonstrate the potential of satellite remote
   sensing products for improving forest type maps and for assessing forest
   change over the last 25 years. Change detection products are needed for
   assessing risks for specific priority coastal forest types, such as live
   oak and baldcypress-dominated forest. Preliminary results indicate
   Landsat time series data are capable of generating the needed forest
   type and change detection products. Useful classifications were obtained
   using 2 strategies: 1) general forest classification based on use of 3
   seasons of Landsat data from the same year; and 2) classification of
   specific forest types of concern using a single date of Landsat data in
   which a given targeted type is spectrally distinct compared to adjacent

   Landsat data. Elevation data helped to define areas in which targeted
   forest types occur, such as live oak forests on natural levees. MODIS

   these new, promising products. The products from the ROSES project will
   be available for aiding NGOM coastal forest restoration and

Title = {{Landscape variation in plant leaf flammability is driven by leaf traits
   responding to environmental gradients}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Landscape differences in environmental conditions select for divergences
   among plant species in strategically important leaf traits such as leaf
   mass per area (LMA) and leaf area (LA). Interspecific variation in some
   of these same leaf traits has been associated to varying degrees with
   differences among species in leaf flammability, including the attributes
   ignitibility, sustainability, and combustibility. Yet, how
   environmentally selected variation in leaf traits drives variation in
   leaf flammability at landscape scales remains largely unknown. Here, we
   compared leaf traits and flammability attributes between species of
   sheltered forest vegetation (low light, moist habitat) and plant species
   of exposed woodland vegetation (high light, dry habitat) in a fire-prone
   landscape of south-eastern Australia. We found that leaves of sheltered
   forest species were significantly more flammable via both higher
   ignitibility and combustibility compared with exposed woodland species.
   These significant differences in leaf ignitibility and combustibility
   were underpinned by sheltered forest species having leaves with
   significantly larger LA and lower LMA compared with exposed woodland
   species. Further, multiple regression analyses revealed that both LA and
   LMA were significantly and uniquely related to faster time to ignition
   (TTI; ignitibility) and higher mean mass loss rate (combustibility).
   Most notably, although significantly higher fuel moisture content (FMC)
   of leaves of sheltered forest species significantly lengthened TTI, the
   lower LMA of these species played a more critical role in reducing TTI,
   with low LMA explaining more unique variation (partial r(2) = 0.78) in
   high leaf ignitibility than low FMC (partial r(2) = 0.49). Our findings
   provide the first evidence that landscape-scale variation in leaf
   flammability is tightly coordinated with the primary strategic response
   of the leaf traits LMA and LA to an environmental gradient. Furthermore,
   projections for increasing wildfire frequency and intensity in the
   region will likely allow wildfires to overcome the once protective
   nature provided by topography to sheltered forest vegetation, which
   means that higher leaf flammability in sheltered forest species has the
   potential to exacerbate the effects of changing weather conditions to
   place sheltered forest habitat, their plants, and their animals, at even
   higher risk of catastrophic wildfire.}},

Abstract = {{Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are frequently prescribed after

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Context More than a century of forest and fire management of Inland
   Pacific landscapes has transformed their successional and disturbance
   dynamics. Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats
   is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been
   altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many
   disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current
   efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison
   to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects
   emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands,
   while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow
   issues.
   Methods We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven
   principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate
   their application with examples.
   Results Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple
   scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions
   among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional
   and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers.
   Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred
   a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent
   contagious disturbances.
   Conclusions To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current
   landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local
   landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration
   that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require
   active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that
   provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems.
   We focus attention on landscape-level prescriptions as foundational to
   restoration planning and execution.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive ecological change has been sustained by many dryland
   ecosystems throughout the world, resulting in conversion to so-called
   novel ecosystems. It is within such ecological contexts that native
   plant materials destined for ecological applications must be able to
   function. In the Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp.
   wyomingensis {[}Beetle \& A.M. Young] S.L. Welsh) ecosystems of the
   Intermountain West, for example, novel ecosystem structure and
   functioning are pervasive. Invasive species, particularly annual
   grasses, fuel repeated wildfires that drive previously stable ecosystem
   states across thresholds to less desirable states that are highly
   recalcitrant to restoration efforts. Structural changes include
   reductions of native flora, damage to biological soil crusts, and
   alterations to soil microbiota. Functional changes include altered
   hydrologic and nutrient cycling, leading to permanent losses of soil
   organic matter and nitrogen that favor the invaders. We argue that there
   is an important place in restoration for plant materials that are novel

Abstract = {{Amiodarone (AD) is one of the most frequently prescribed anti-arrhythmic
   agents worldwide, but its effectiveness is limited due to the
   development of pulmonary toxicity. Several lines of evidence have
   suggested that AT1 receptor antagonists can attenuate pulmonary fibrosis
   in different animal models. This study was performed to evaluate the
   effect of olmesartan medoxomil (OM) on lung injury induced in rats by AD
   which was assessed biochemically (hydroxyproline content, MDA level and
   SOD activity), histologically (Ashcroft criteria and Masson's trichrome
   stain) and immunohistochemically (TGF-1 expression in lung tissue). The
   expression levels of TGF-1 and type I collagen mRNA were also determined
   by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Forty-eight adult
   male rats were randomized into six equal groups: control group, OM
   control groups, AD group received 40 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 4 weeks to
   induce pulmonary injury in rats and OM-treated groups received 0.6 and 6
   mg/kg/day, p.o. concomitantly with AD for the same period. The results
   indicated that OM significantly decreased collagen deposition and
   hydroxyproline content, ameliorated pathological score and decreased the
   elevation in type I collagen and TGF-ss 1 mRNA expression in lung
   tissue. Furthermore, it attenuated the AD-induced increase in the MDA
   level and increased SOD activity in lung tissue. It can be concluded
   that OM exerts a protective effect against AD-induced lung damage in
   rats which is attributed to modulation of pro-fibrogenic cytokine
   (TGF-1) and antioxidant effect.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat-based conservation is a priority for the endangered American
   burying beetle (Nicrophorus americanus Olivier), but its annual life

   were to (i) assess factors affecting detection of beetles with baited
   pitfall traps, (ii) identify important habitat characteristics, and
   (iii) map spatio-temporal patterns of habitat quality and beetle
   abundance. At a military installation in western Arkansas with one of
   the largest remaining N.americanus populations, 257 sites were surveyed
   over 5years using three nights of baited pitfall trapping at each site.
   Geographic information systems (GIS)-based habitat assessments included
   three site radii (100, 800, and 1600m). Year-specific vegetation
   condition was quantified using satellite images and other GIS data.
   N-mixture models were used to account for imperfect detection and to
   assess competing models of beetle abundance and detection. Detection
   rates (mean=20\%) were dependent on overnight temperature, dew point,
   and wind speed with upper and lower temperature thresholds beyond which
   detection was reduced. Habitat assessments were most effective within
   800m site radii, consistent with previous estimates of N.americanus trap
   sample range. Beetle abundance was associated with grasslands and
   open-canopy woodlands with rolling topography, sandy loam soils, and
   moderate patchy disturbances from wildfire. Landsat, unlike vegetation
   maps, quantified year-specific habitat quality and allowed
   spatio-temporal population dynamics to be mapped at a yearly time-step

Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Abstract = {{Disturbances have altered community dynamics in boreal forests with
   unknown consequences for belowground ecological processes. Soil fungi
   are particularly sensitive to such disturbances; however, the individual
   response of fungal guilds to different disturbance types is poorly
   understood. Here, we profiled soil fungal communities in lodgepole pine
   forests following a bark beetle outbreak, wildfire, clear-cut logging,
   and salvage-logging. Using Illumina MiSeq to sequence ITS1 and SSU rDNA,
   we characterized communities of ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal,
   saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungi in sites representing each
   disturbance type paired with intact forests. We also quantified soil
   fungal biomass by measuring ergosterol. Abiotic disturbances changed the
   community composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi and shifted the dominance
   from ectomycorrhizal to saprotrophic fungi compared to intact forests.
   The disruption of the soil organic layer with disturbances correlated
   with the decline of ectomycorrhizal and the increase of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi. Wildfire changed the community composition of
   pathogenic fungi but did not affect their proportion and diversity.
   Fungal biomass declined with disturbances that disrupted the forest

Abstract = {{Aim Large disturbances increasingly shape the world's forests.
   Concomitantly, increasing amounts of forest are subject to salvage
   logging. Understanding and managing the world's forests thus
   increasingly hinges upon understanding the combined effects of natural
   disturbance and logging disturbance, including interactions so far
   unnoticed. Here, we use recent advances in disturbance-interaction
   theory to disentangle and describe the mechanisms through which natural
   disturbance (e.g., wildfire, insect outbreak or windstorm) can interact
   with anthropogenic disturbance (logging) to produce unanticipated
   effects. We also explore to what extent such interactions have been
   addressed in empirical research globally.
   Insights First, many ecological responses to salvage logging likely
   result from interaction modifications-i.e., from non-additive
   effects-between natural disturbance and logging. However, based on a
   systematic review encompassing 209 relevant papers, we found that
   interaction modifications have been largely neglected. Second, salvage
   logging constitutes an interaction chain because natural disturbances
   increase the likelihood, intensity and extent of subsequent logging
   disturbance due to complex socio-ecological interactions. Both
   interaction modifications and interaction chains can be driven by
   nonlinear responses to the severity of each disturbance. We show that,
   whereas many of the effects of salvage logging likely arise from the
   multiple kinds of disturbance interactions between natural disturbance
   and logging, they have mostly been overlooked in research to date.
   Conclusions Interactions between natural disturbance and logging imply
   that increasing disturbances will produce even more disturbance, and
   with unknown characteristics and consequences. Disentangling the
   pathways producing disturbance interactions is thus crucial to guide
   management and policy regarding naturally disturbed forests.}},

   total of 96 nest boxes was established using a rigorous experimental
   design - two regions ( Powelltown and Toolangi State Forests), two
   forest age classes (20-year post-logging regrowth and 60-year fire- and
   salvage-logging regrowth), two nest-box designs ( large boxes with large
   entrance holes and small boxes with small entrance holes), and two
   heights at which nest boxes were attached to trees ( 3 m and 8 m above
   the ground). The study entailed setting out four nest boxes at each of
   24 sites to meet the design criteria. Evidence of occupancy by
   vertebrates was recorded in a total of 19 of 96 boxes on 11 of 24 sites
   site during regular inspections over more than three years. Thirteen
   boxes were used by Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri), six
   by the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami) and seven by
   the common ringtail possum ( Pseudocheirus peregrinus). The common
   ringtail possum and mountain brushtail possum were seen only in high -
   large boxes but Leadbeater's possum used all but the low - large boxes.
   There was evidence of spatial dependence in usage patterns, with all
   four boxes at a given site showing signs of eventually being occupied.
   Only two nest boxes located in mountain ash forest regenerating after
   the 1939 wildfires were occupied. Relatively limited use of nest boxes
   supports concerns about the use of a nest box over large scales and long
   timeframes as an effective recovery tool for species threatened by the

Abstract = {{Wildfires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are increasingly common
   forest disturbances. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage
   logging, i.e., the felling and removal of the affected trees; however,
   this practice may represent an additional disturbance with effects on
   ecosystem processes and services. We developed a systematic map to
   provide an overview of the primary studies on this topic and created a
   database with information on the characteristics of the retrieved
   publications, including information on stands, disturbance,
   intervention, measured outcomes, and study design. Of 4341 retrieved
   publications, 90 were retained in the systematic map. These publications
   represented 49 studies, predominantly from North America and Europe.
   Salvage logging after wildfire was addressed more frequently than after
   insect outbreaks or windstorms. Most studies addressed logging after a
   single disturbance event, and replication of salvaged stands rarely
   exceeded 10. The most frequent response variables were tree
   regeneration, ground cover, and deadwood characteristics. This document
   aims to help managers find the most relevant primary studies on the
   ecological effects of salvage logging. It also aims to identify and
   discuss clusters and gaps in the body of evidence, relevant for
   scientists who aim to synthesize previous work or identify questions for
   future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Recent extensive forest mortality and subsequent salvage logging may
   threaten the water supply from headwater catchments in western North
   America. Land managers confronting current insect outbreaks and
   projected increases in forest disturbance require information about the
   potential water quality consequences of these changes. This study is a
   hillslope-scale evaluation of soil N and C leaching in lodgepole pine
   forests that have experienced 80\% overstory tree mortality. I measured
   extractable inorganic and ion resin exchangeable-N forms, in situ net
   mineralization and nitrification, and leaching in upland and riparian
   forests with the following treatment combinations: (i) uncut upland with
   uncut riparian, (ii) harvested upland with uncut riparian buffer, and
   (iii) harvested upland with harvested riparian. This design permitted
   comparison of N cycling and leaching in 30-m-wide riparian buffers and a
   riparian fuel break designed to remove canopy fuels and reduce wildfire
   concerns in areas with extensive bark beetle infestation. Harvesting
   increased NO3-N, total dissolved N, and dissolved organic C leachate
   concentrations in upland landscapes but had little effect on net N
   transformations. Leachate N and C concentrations were 1.5 times higher
   in riparian buffers downslope of harvested uplands than those in
   riparian zones downslope of uncut uplands. Riparian forest harvest
   increased N leaching relative to uncut buffers, although postharvest
   concentrations remained well below regional water quality standards.
   Thus, while this study provides evidence that N leaching from dead
   buffers is low, it also suggests that riparian fuel reduction may
   complement wildfire mitigation objectives without compromising watershed
   protection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives of postfire seeding in the Great Basin include
   reestablishment of perennial cover, suppression of exotic annual weeds,
   and restoration of diverse plant communities. Nonconventional seeding
   techniques may be required when seeding mixes of grasses, forbs, and
   shrubs containing seeds of different sizes. We conducted an
   operational-scale experiment to test the effectiveness of two rangeland
   drills (conventional and minimum-till) for seeding native plant mixes
   following wildfire in Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.
   ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \& Young) communities. Both drills were
   configured to place small and large seeds in alternate rows. We
   hypothesized that the minimum-till drill's advanced features would
   improve establishment compared with the conventional drill. We also
   hypothesized that the minimum-till drill would cause less damage to
   residual perennials, whereas the conventional drill would have a greater
   impact on annual weeds. The experiment was replicated at three burned
   sites and monitored for 2 yr at each site. Seeded plant establishment
   was lowest at a low-precipitation site that became dominated by exotic
   annuals. Another site had high perennial grass establishment, which
   effectively suppressed exotic annuals, while a third site attained high
   diversity of seeded species and life forms but became invaded by exotic
   annuals in plant interspaces. Small-seeded species generally established
   better with the minimum-till drill equipped with imprinter wheels than
   the conventional drill with drag-chains. However, large-seeded species
   frequently established better with the conventional drill despite its
   lack of depth bands and press wheels. Soil disturbance associated with
   the conventional drill had a negative effect on residual perennials and
   exotic annuals at some sites. Results indicate that different drill
   features are advantageous in different ways, but that either of the
   tested drills, if properly used, can be effective for seeding native
   plant mixes provided site conditions are otherwise favorable for

Abstract = {{Spruce beetle-induced (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby)) mortality on the
   Kenai Peninsula has been hypothesized by local ecologists to result in
   the conversion of forest to grassland and subsequent increased fire
   danger. This hypothesis stands in contrast to empirical studies in the
   continental US which suggested that beetle mortality has only a
   negligible effect on fire danger. In response, we conducted a study
   using Landsat data and modeling techniques to map land cover change in
   the Kenai Peninsula and to integrate change maps with other geospatial
   data to predictively map fire danger for the same region. We collected
   Landsat imagery to map land cover change at roughly five-year intervals
   following a severe, mid-1990s beetle infestation to the present. Land
   cover classification was performed at each time step and used to
   quantify grassland encroachment patterns over time. The maps of land
   cover change along with digital elevation models (DEMs), temperature,
   and historical fire data were used to map and assess wildfire danger
   across the study area. Results indicate the highest wildfire danger
   tended to occur in herbaceous and black spruce land cover types,
   suggesting that the relationship between spruce beetle damage and
   wildfire danger in costal Alaskan forested ecosystems differs from the
   relationship between the two in the forests of the coterminous United
   States. These change detection analyses and fire danger predictions
   provide the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KENWR) ecologists and other

Abstract = {{Wildfires in the Great Basin have resulted in widespread loss of Wyoming
   big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle \&
   Young), an ecologically important shrub that has proven difficult to
   establish from seed. We sought to identify optimal seeding practices for
   Wyoming big sagebrush in the context of postfire seeding operations
   involving rangeland drills. In an experiment replicated at three burned
   sites in the northern Great Basin, we compared Wyoming big sagebrush
   establishment across treatments differing by seed delivery technique,
   timing, and rate of seed application. A seed mix containing bunchgrasses
   was drill-seeded in alternate rows using one of two drill-types
   (conventional or minimum-till), and a mix containing sagebrush was
   either delivered by drill to the soil surface in remaining rows or
   broadcast by hand (simulating aerial seeding) following drilling in fall
   or winter. Drill-delivery of sagebrush seed was accompanied by drag
   chains (conventional drill) or imprinter wheels (minimum-till drill) to
   improve seed-soil contact and was carried out at multiple seeding rates
   (ca. 50, 250, and 500 pure live seed m(-2)). During 2 yr following
   seeding, sagebrush establishment was lower at two sites (yr 1: <= 1.2
   plants m(-2); yr2: <= 0.8 plants m(-2)) compared with a third site (yr
   1: <= 4.1 plants m(-2); yr 2: <= 2.0 plants m(-2)) where treatment
   differences were more pronounced and significant. Wherever density
   differed between treatments, it was consistently higher in certain
   treatment levels (minimum-till > conventional drill, drill-delivery >
   broadcast-delivery, fall broadcast > winter broadcast, and higher rates
   > lower rates). Densities declined between years at two sites, but we
   did not find evidence that declines were due to density-dependent
   mortality. Results indicate that seeding success can likely be enhanced

   higher than typical postfire seeding recommendations for Wyoming big

   100 radio-tagged toads monitored for one summer during these years, 32\%
   survived until September, 29\% were killed by predators, 10\% died of
   other causes, and 29\% were missing or had lost transmitters. At four
   study areas sampled in 2005, 24\% of 37 males and 44\% of 32 females
   sampled during the breeding season, and three dead male toads found
   after the breeding season tested positive for Bairachochytrium
   dendrobatidis. Females traveled significantly farther than males, and
   the maximum distances traveled by female and male toads were 6230 m and
   3870 m, respectively. Toads with transmitters selected habitats: (1)
   with little or no canopy; (2) on south-facing slopes; (3) near water;
   and (4) with high densities of potential refugia (e.g., burrows, rocks,
   logs). Males were more closely associated with water than females.
   Twenty-six toads overwintered in rodent burrows (38\%), under large
   rocks (27\%), under logs or root wads (19\%), and under banks adjacent
   to streams or a lake (15\%). Diet consisted of 82\% ants (Formicidae),

   95\%. Results indicate that a gunpowder-powered captive bolt can produce
   favourable animal welfare outcomes for euthanasing kangaroo pouch young
   by delivering more than 40 times the kinetic energy delivered by
   previously studied captive bolt units applied to pouch young. When

   Tropane alkaloids from nightshade plants are neurotransmitter inhibitors

Title = {{The impact of forest disturbances on residual biomass supply: A
   long-term forest level analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{248}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Residual forest biomass is an attractive feedstock for bioenergy
   production due to its abundance and renewability. However, natural
   forest disturbances such as wildfire and insect infestation cause
   unpredictable fluctuations in supply, disrupting long-term procurement
   plans for delivering feedstock to biorefineries. This study proposes a
   method to assess the impact of disturbances on long-term supply of
   residual forest biomass. The method was integrated within a framework of
   forest management planning for timber production, reflecting current
   reality of commercially-managed forests. The method was implemented to a
   case study in eastern Canada focusing on the two most prevalent forest
   disturbances, wildfire and spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana
   {[}Clemen]) infestation. Nine scenarios were considered, with
   disturbance rates ranging from 0 to 1.6\% yr(-1) (predicted maximum).
   Residual biomass considered in this study were (i) logging residue, (ii)
   salvage biomass, and (iii) sawmill residue. The results show that, as
   the disturbance rate increases, the area available for timber harvest
   decreases, leading to a reduction in logging and sawmill residues. In
   the highest disturbance rate scenario, logging and sawmill residue
   decreases by almost 40\%. Collection of salvage biomass can make up for
   the reduction, redeeming approximately 20\% of the loss. Our method
   complements the conventional timber production planning process,
   allowing quantification of residual biomass supply in the face of
   uncertain natural disturbances due to climate change. The proposed
   method should support managers in their effort to maintain robust supply
   chains, while facilitating the adoption of the principles of circular
   economy. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New initiatives are emerging to rehabilitate vast expanses of lodgepole
   pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) recently affected by insect
   outbreaks and wildfires across western North America. By assessing
   potential long-term changes in productivity, environmentally-sensitive
   models of tree growth can help to make informed decisions about where
   lodgepole pine will likely thrive and how it will respond to
   silvicultural treatments under future environmental conditions. It
   remains a challenge, however, to produce models that are practical to
   apply, statistically robust, and representative of real-world
   complexity. In this study, we developed composite models of aboveground
   biomass growth of lodgepole pine, with the purpose of assessing the
   statistical performance and behaviour of models covering a range of
   complexity. Adding complexity, including environmental sensitivity, did
   not appreciably increase explained variance over that of models based on
   tree size, stand competition, and site conditions alone. Nevertheless,
   Akaike's Information Criterion and cross-validation results offered no
   reason to dismiss the most complex model, which additionally considered
   insects, pathogens, heat, water, nitrogen deposition, and carbon dioxide
   concentration, and interactions among covariates. For models that
   represented environmental sensitivity, average predictions of growth
   increased between historical and future periods, but the increases were
   not significant at the 95\% confidence level. Despite consistency in the
   overall average future change in growth among environmentally-sensitive
   models, the consideration of interactions among environmental variables
   caused fundamental changes in the magnitude and spatial pattern of
   future predictions, suggesting that interactive responses of tree growth
   to changing climate and atmospheric composition remain an important
   knowledge gap, that can likely only be constrained by improved
   coordination of field sampling and experimentation.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of hollow-bearing trees and lack of replacements are important
   issues throughout the world where development of intensive agriculture
   has resulted in the reduction and fragmentation of natural woodlands.
   Many species of animal depend on hollows (cavities) for breeding and
   shelter, and are impacted by these changes. One such species is the
   endangered Carnaby's Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus latirostris, an endemic of
   southwestern Australia, which nests in large hollows in eucalypt trees.
   Nest hollow selection by a breeding population at Coomallo Creek, in the
   wheatbelt of Western Australia, was studied from 1969 to 2013. The
   cockatoos nested in any hollow large enough to access (mean entrance
   diameter 270 mm, floor diameter 407 mm and depth 1.24 m). Nesting
   attempts in shallow hollows (<400 mm) were less successful than those in
   deeper hollows (>1000 mm). Breeding females returned to the same hollow
   they used previously, provided they had been successful in the previous
   breeding attempt and the hollow was not occupied.
   During the study, the cockatoos used 252 large hollow-bearing trees. By
   2013 40\% of these had fallen or been pushed over, had been burnt
   deliberately or by wildfire, or had been damaged such that they were no
   longer suitable for use by the cockatoos; an average annual loss rate of
   0.91\%. Based on this rate of loss, only 29\% of large hollow-bearing
   trees standing in 2013 will be extant in 2125 and not all of these can
   be expected to offer useable nest hollows. The conservation implications
   arising from the results of the study are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Evidence of Climate-Induced Range Contractions in Bull Trout Salvelinus

Abstract = {{Many freshwater fish species are considered vulnerable to stream
   temperature warming associated with climate change because they are
   ectothermic, yet there are surprisingly few studies documenting changes
   in distributions. Streams and rivers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains have
   been warming for several decades. At the same time these systems have
   been experiencing an increase in the severity and frequency of
   wildfires, which often results in habitat changes including increased
   water temperatures. We resampled 74 sites across a Rocky Mountain
   watershed 17 to 20 years after initial samples to determine whether
   there were trends in bull trout occurrence associated with temperature,
   wildfire, or other habitat variables. We found that site abandonment
   probabilities (0.36) were significantly higher than colonization
   probabilities (0.13), which indicated a reduction in the number of
   occupied sites. Site abandonment probabilities were greater at low
   elevations with warm temperatures. Other covariates, such as the
   presence of wildfire, nonnative brook trout, proximity to areas with
   many adults, and various stream habitat descriptors, were not associated
   with changes in probability of occupancy. Higher abandonment
   probabilities at low elevation for bull trout provide initial evidence
   validating the predictions made by bioclimatic models that bull trout
   populations will retreat to higher, cooler thermal refuges as water
   temperatures increase. The geographic breadth of these declines across
   the region is unknown but the approach of revisiting historical sites
   using an occupancy framework provides a useful template for additional
   assessments.}},

Title = {{Two-year evaluation of fuelbreaks grazed by livestock in the wildfire

Volume = {{141}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing of fuelbreaks is a silvopastoral practice which is
   promoted in several Mediterranean regions with the objective of
   improving wildfire prevention. In the grazed fuelbreak network in
   Andalusia (Spain), over 2000 ha of fuelbreaks were characterized and
   grazing in them was evaluated in 2008 and 2009. The grazing evaluation
   was based on several visual assessments of the utilization rate of
   vegetation by livestock and the general grazing level observed. These
   parameters were employed to classify fuelbreaks into four levels of
   accomplishment of the grazing objectives, both through individual
   assessments (2008) and with the aid of an automatic procedure based on
   discriminant analysis (2009). The accuracy of the automatic
   classification functions for 2009 reached 86\%. This value remained high
   (82\%) when only the parameter with the most discriminatory power (the
   mean general grazing level) and predefined thresholds were employed.
   Based on these results, a streamlined monitoring system is proposed to
   evaluate grazing in fuelbreaks. Regarding fuelbreak characteristics,
   larger shrub volumes were found to negatively affect the accomplishment
   of grazing objectives. For fuelbreak surface area, distance to animal
   shelter and mean steepness, the data were non-conclusive. Both goat and
   sheep flocks demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing fuel loads.

   pygmy-possum (Cercartetus nanus) in burnt and unburnt habitats}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{627-637}},
Abstract = {{The eastern pygmy-possum (Cercartetus nanus) occurs broadly but patchily
   in south- eastern Australia. It is a small, difficult-to-trap marsupial
   with poorly known resource and habitat preferences. This study
   investigated the structural and floristic habitat resources used and
   selected by C. nanus in Royal National Park (which was heavily burnt by
   bushfire in 1994) and Heathcote National Park (most of which had
   remained unburnt for over two decades at the time of study), in
   central-coastal New South Wales. Three different sampling methods were
   used pitfall traps, Elliott traps and hair tubes - with pitfall trapping
   being by far the most effective method for detecting C. nanus.
   Live-trapping in different habitats revealed higher numbers of C. nanus
   in unburnt and burnt woodland, burnt heathland and burnt coastal complex
   than in unburnt coastal complex and burnt and unburnt rainforest. To
   identify the components of habitat contributing to this pattern, we
   first scored floristic and structural features of vegetation around trap
   stations and then quantified habitat components further by using spool-
   and radio-tracking. We found little evidence that C. nanus responded to
   any structural components of habitat, although arboreal activity was
   greater, not surprisingly, in wooded than in burnt heathland habitats.
   C. nanus was associated most strongly with the abundance of certain
   plants in the Proteaceae and Myrtaceae. In particular, the species
   prefers Banksia spp. ( probably for food) and Eucalyptus and
   Xanthorrhoea spp. ( probably for shelter).}},
